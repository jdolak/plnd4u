AFST 20034,"In June 2020, prompted by the horrific killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, our nation awakened to the brutality of institutional racism and the violence to human dignity it has wrought in communities of color throughout America's history. The movement for racial justice was renewed in vigor with nationwide protests and calls for action. Although the protests of 2020 have largely been a response to a crisis surrounding police violence, the calls to action have focused attention on the breadth of systemic racism in all facets of American life. In this course, students will engage weekly with a single event or concept, drawn from a variety of disciplines, necessary to understand and dismantle systemic racism. The course centers around a weekly guest-lecture series featuring authors, public intellectuals, faith leaders, and external and internal members of the academy. In each guest-lecture class period, the guest expert provides a sophisticated introduction to a discrete racial justice topic. Some lectures address historical events not widely known (e.g., the Tulsa massacre or the arrival of the first slave ship in the Americas in 1619); others address current racial inequities (e.g., the wealth gap, health outcomes, criminal justice, voter suppression); still others examine broad concepts (e.g., intersectionality, Catholic teaching on racism). Specific topics to be determined by expert availability. This three-credit version of the course is designed for students who are interested in a more intensive study of each week's topic. Students will participate in once-weekly in-person seminar sessions with readings to accompany the speaker and topic for the week. Following each guest lecture, students will gather briefly via zoom to reflect and respond. Throughout the course of the semester, students will compose a variety of short papers, lead classroom discussions, and complete a final project incorporating independent research on related topics."
AFST 20075,"This course will serve as an introduction to the field of international development, with particular focus on the various disciplines that have contributed to and shaped the development discourse over the past six decades.  Readings and lectures will draw from economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, environmental and technological sciences, public health and epidemiology, area studies, ethnic studies, and gender studies.  A large component of this course will focus on in-class discussions and presentations that engage the broader debates within development studies in order to critically evaluate the development discourse.  Required course work will include group or individual student projects that investigate current development issues and propose engaged solutions that incorporate social justice and human dignity."
AFST 20082,"Through a multidisciplinary and cross-cultural exploration, this course will 1) introduce students to key concepts, themes, and theories in the field of Africana Studies; and 2) introduce students to the identities and experiences of black populations throughout the global African Diaspora.  Over the course of the semester, we will tackle the following questions: What is Africana Studies? What are the historical, intellectual, and political origins of Africana Studies?  What are race and ethnicity? What is blackness? What roles do class, culture, gender, nationality, and religion, play in blackness? What is the African Diaspora?  What role does Africa play in blackness? How do the arts, humanities, and social sciences help us investigate, analyze, conceptualize, represent, and understand this thing we refer to as blackness?  What are some of the historical, geographical, socio-political, and cultural points of divergence observable between populations of African descent throughout the Diaspora and what, if any, are the points of commonality that unite these dispersed populations?"
AFST 20130,"Considering the contemporary rise in the aesthetics of the genre of black horror, this course will explore literary and artistic horror(s) that black artists examine in America. We will work to study how black horror reminds us of the power of crafting narratives in America. We will be watching numerous horror films and shows and reading numerous literary authors. We will be reading and working with authors like: Toni Morrison, Richard Wright, Gwendolyn Brooks, James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, and many others. A close observation of this genre will allow us to question what constitutes horror and how is it connected to the humanities, law, and elements of science as well? This course is designed to help you build sound critical arguments and analysis by writing multiple genres of essays like a narrative essay, a close analysis essay, a podcast essay, and a final research essay."
AFST 20274,"African peoples and empires have always been at the heart of transformative world events. Their wealth, ingenuity, and power reshaped the medieval global economy. Their enslavement and back-breaking forced labor fueled industrial and agricultural revolutions. Their struggle against western racism and imperialism awakened pan-African consciousness. And today, their creativity and entrepreneurialism drive popular culture and economic opportunity. In this course, we will explore the many ways Africans shaped the history of the world. We will do so by examining primary documents, reading African fiction, watching African films, and immersing ourselves in current trends in Africa."
AFST 20401,"A music appreciation course requiring no musical background and no prerequisites. General coverage of the history, various styles, and major performers of jazz, with an emphasis on current practice. Receive permission from the instructor (ldwyer@nd.edu)"
AFST 20477,"This introductory course uses popular film as a primary text/medium to explore fundamental questions in the academic study of religion. In particular, we will be concerned with the ways that faith, spirituality, religion and religious experience are constituted and defined on film as well as through film viewing. Emphasis will be placed on film’s reflecting African Diaspora, Latinx and Caribbean cultures and the inclusion of religions outside of the Judeo-Christian canon for context and comparison. In discussing films from across a range of subjects and genres, we will engage in the work of mythical, theological and ideological criticism, while examining the nature, function, and value of religion and religious experience. We will also consider significant writers and traditions in the field of Diaspora Religions and develop the analytical and interpretive skills of the discipline. Given the depth and breadth of religious orthodoxies and faith-based practices existent throughout the Diaspora, students will be exposed to a variety of film genres including silent films, anime, documentary, drama, biography, comedy and horror.  Based on availability, and the student cohort’s familiarity or lack of material the scheduled films will include twelve to fifteen selections from the lists below. Weekly readings, writing assignments, and screening sessions are required."
AFST 20600,"This course will focus on the relationship between democratic institutions, peace, and economic/human development. While drawing on lessons from North America and Europe, we will focus largely on countries of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. During the semester, we will discuss and debate the merits of various explanations or hypotheses that political scientists have proposed to answer the following questions: Why are some countries more developed and democratic than others? Is development necessary for democracy or democracy necessary for development? What is the relationship between culture, development, and democracy?  How do different types of political institutions affect the prospects for development and democracy? Should/how should U.S. and other established democracies promote democratization? By the end of the course, the objectives are that students (1) learn the most important theories intended to explain why some countries are more democratic and developed than others, (2) understand the complexity of any relationship between democracy and development, and (3) grow in the ability to think about and intelligently assess the strengths and weaknesses of strategies intended to promote democracy and development."
AFST 20704,"Many have claimed that the American educational system is the great equalizer among men. In other words, the educational system gives everyone a chance to prosper in American society regardless of their social origins. In this course, we will explore the validity of this claim. Do schools help make American society more equal by reducing the importance of class, race, and gender as sources of inequality, or do schools simply reinforce existing inequalities and reproduce pre-existing social relations? Topics covered in the course include: unequal resources among schools, sorting practices of students within schools, parents' role in determining student outcomes, the role of schooling in determining labor market outcomes for individuals, and the use of educational programs as a remedy for poverty."
AFST 20781,"This course will examine the Latino experience in the United States, including the historical, cultural, and political foundations of Latino life. We will approach these topics comparatively, thus attention will be given to the various experiences of a multiplicity of Latino groups in the United States. This course has an optional community-engaged learning component with La Casa de Amistad."

Specific topics to be determined by expert availability. Students prepare for the sessions by researching the speaker or topic and preparing thoughtful questions to be posed during the guest's visit. Students also participate in at least two small group discussions and, at the conclusion of the semester, are required to produce a short reflective writing piece. The entire course will be offered via zoom for all participants."
AFST 30113,"The title of Duane and Capshaw Smith's book, Who Writes for Black Children? African American Children's Literature Before 1900 captures the essence of this course and serves as our foundation. We will explore the long rich history of literature for African American children by African American authors and challenge deficit, dominant narratives about literacy practices of African American communities before 1900 up to the present day. The majority of the course will focus on literature for children from the 20th century up to recent publications, trends in children's literature that have provided a platform or silenced authors, and how social, cultural, and political factors have controlled whose work is published, which texts are published and distributed, and the impact this has on how individuals and communities view themselves and others. We will draw on a range of literary theories to analyze literature and each student will develop an in-depth author study of an artist of their choice with a strong focus on historical, cultural, and social influences and contexts. Throughout the semester, we will explore the power of literature for disrupting, transforming, and challenging negative and racist ideologies that perpetuate inequality and injustice in American society."
AFST 30214,"This course explores the relationships among and between workers, employers, government policymakers, unions, and social movements since the end of World War II, as well as the ways in which those relationships have shaped and been shaped by American politics and culture more broadly. The United States emerged from the Second World War as the globe's unequaled economic and political power, and its citizens parlayed that preeminence into a long postwar economic boom that created, however imperfectly, the first truly mass middle-class society in world history. At the heart of that new society was the American labor movement, whose leaders and members ensured that at least some of the heady postwar profits made it into the wallets of workers and their families - and not just the wallets of union members, as working Americans generally experienced great improvement in wages, benefits, and economic opportunity during the quarter-century ending in 1970. During those same years, civil rights activists challenged the historic workplace discrimination that kept African Americans at the bottom of the labor market, confronting the racism of employers, unions, and the government, and inspiring others, primarily Mexican Americans and women, to broaden the push for equality at the workplace. Since that time, however, Americans have experienced a transformation in the workplace -- an erosion of manufacturing and the massive growth of service and government work; a rapid decline in number of union members and power of organized labor; and unresolved conflicts over affirmative action to redress centuries of racial and gender discrimination. Meanwhile, income inequality and wealth disparities have grown every year over the past three decades. What accounts for the decline of organized labor since 1970, and why have the people of the mythic land of milk and honey experienced declining upward mobility and widening gaps between the rich and everyone else? Are these phenomena linked? What has the decline of the labor movement meant for workers specifically, and the American economy and politics more broadly? How and why have popular perceptions of unions changed over time? What has been the relationship of organized labor to the civil rights movement, feminism, modern conservatism, and the fortunes of individual freedom more broadly? What is globalization, and what has been its impact upon American workers? Through an exploration of historical scholarship, memoirs, polemical writings, and films, this course will try to answer these questions and many others. It will also address the prospects for working people and labor unions in the twenty-first century."
AFST 30248,"In 2023, it is difficult to avoid the language of antiracism, and harder still to discern its politics. Is racism a matter of structure or intention? Culture or economics? What does racial justice look like? And what exactly are those structures anyways? Moving from the civil rights movement of the 1960s to the George Floyd Uprisings of 2020, this course introduces students to the history behind a freighted term. We will read classic and contemporary texts of antiracism, tracking how American activists, politicians, artists, and scholars wrestled with these questions in the twilight years of the welfare state, mass industry, and securely waged employment. "
AFST 30294,"When Columbus stepped ashore in the Caribbean in 1492, he set in motion a process that led to the creation of wealthy Spanish and Portuguese empires in the Americas, the genocide of countless numbers of indigenous men and women, the enslavement of millions of African men and women, and the eventual formation of a variety of independent states competing in the world economy. In this semester-long survey, we will examine topics in this history that will allow us to consider how history is produced as well as what happened in the past, from various perspectives, from elite colonial administrators and merchants to indigenous peasants and formerly enslaved men and women."
AFST 30297,"The purpose of this course is to introduce students to major themes in the global history of slavery with a specific focus on the location of slavery in the making of the modern world bringing together histories from the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean worlds. The course will focus upon these themes through literature, economics, and politics. In addition, the course will also introduce students to recent museum exhibitions, art exhibitions, digital history projects, films, and documentary compilations that all together have transformed how the global history of slavery is understood. "
AFST 30685,"While there is a wealth of academic work on race, racism, and anti-racism in the domestic realm, there is less attention to them in the international context. This is unfortunate, because they cannot be domestically confined. United Nations resolutions against racism, debates about whether the International Criminal Court is racially biased, and the global wave of anti-racist protests in 2020 are a few examples. This course examines race in the international context, exploring how it affects, is affected by, and is intertwined with central topics in international relations, including human rights, war and peace, foreign policy, international law and international organizations."
AFST 30708,"In 2006, Henry Louis Gates popularized the practice of DNA ancestry testing through his PBS series African American Lives. In it, he uses DNA testing to uncover ancestral connections to ethnic groups in Africa, as well as Europe and elsewhere. And yet, scholarly consensus is that race and ethnicity are social constructed- fictional concepts that have real consequences, but are not biological in nature. What is it about race that makes us believe it is constitutive of some essential, biological self, and yet racial categories and meanings are constantly in flux? In this course, we will scrutinize the classification of groups and the naturalization of those categories. Focusing on the United States, throughout the course we will examine the invention, production and reproduction of race from a social constructionist perspective, concentrating on the ways in which the constitution of race is controversial and constantly being remade. We will also discuss how race structures inequality in everyday life.  This course is organized so that it builds from racial classification theory, moves on to an examination of the construction of US racial categories and racial stratification, and closes with an applied focus on racial controversies that are directly tied to resource allocation and federal policy."
AFST 30710,"The aim of the introductory course is to introduce some basic questions about the nature and goals of education, its history, and theoretical explanations of influences on learning, teaching, and schooling. We will incorporate both classic and current texts. The core course will incorporate several disciplinary perspectives"
AFST 30715,"Food access, equity and justice should be of great importance to everyone. Consistently there has been political, economic, geographic and flawed distribution supply chains within the domestic food system. This interdisciplinary course will utilize digital humanities tools and platforms for students to express their research interests. We will analyze the impact that human actions have on foodways, or the social, cultural, and economic practices of producing and consuming food in relation to race, equity and access, historically and currently. We will explore alternative courses of action toward viable, ethical, and antiracist solutions to questions about sustainable farming, global economic inequality, and hunger. Throughout the semester, participants will use the lens of race and ethnicity to study and discuss how these two concepts affect access to agricultural land, foodstuffs /foodways, environmental justice and nature."
AFST 33703,"This seminar explores the intersection of the physical realities of urban environments, race, and education and will be a question-based seminar.  As a group we will work to answer a cluster of questions surrounding the course topic in a systematic, interdisciplinary format.  Questions may include: How does the physical landscape/structure of schools matter to urban education?  How does the high concentration of poverty and racial segregation impact curriculum, school culture, and neighborhood? How do early childhood programming, college preparatory programs, and after-school programs factor into the landscape of urban education? What are best practices involved with teaching in urban environments? The final question we will work on as a group will be: What are the implications of what we know about race and urban landscapes in propelling positive micro- and macro-level change for our educational system?   This course demands a high level of class participation and student initiative."
AFST 40127,"The 2016 film I Am Not Your Negro encourages a new generation to explore the life and work of James Baldwin (1924-1987). Directed by Haitian-born filmmaker Raoul Peck, I Am Not Your Negro is a provocative documentary that envisions a book Baldwin never finished by providing insight into Baldwin's relationship with three men who were assassinated before their fortieth birthdays - Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr. In this course we will interrogate questions of race, sexuality, violence, and migration. Our current political moment encourages the examination of these issues while Baldwin's life and work provides the ideal vantage point for their investigation. Using I Am Not Your Negro as our starting point, Baldwin's life and work will allow us the opportunity to explore transatlantic discourses on nationality, sexuality, race, gender, and religion. We will also explore the work of other writers including Richard Wright, Frantz Fanon, Audre Lorde, and Ta-Nehisi Coates."
AFST 40173,"This course aims to evaluate how major cultural, social, and historical events are portrayed in cinematographic productions of Portugal, Angola, Mozambique and Cape Verde. We will explore issues such as gender, racial and social disparities, the legacies of dictatorship and the colonial wars, the Luso-African struggles for independence, the role of the language in building a nation, and the influence of Portuguese culture in its former colonies. Our goal is to investigate how film productions from and about those countries contest hegemonic accounts, and to examine the interconnections between history, memory and cultural identity and praxis. Films such as All is Well, by Pocas Pascoal (Angola), Dribbling Fate, by Fernando Vendrell (Cape Verde), Sleepwalking Land, by Teresa Prata (Mozambique), Cats Don't Have Vertigo, by Antonio Pedro Vasconcelos, April Captains, by Maria de Medeiros (Portugal), as well as the documentaries Lusitanian Illusion, by Joao Canijo, and Hope the Pitanga Cherries Grow, by Kiluanje Liberdade and Ondjaki will serve as a vehicle for a deeper and broader understanding of how social, racial and cultural issues play a role in film and in the past and present time in Portugal, Angola, Mozambique and Cape Verde. Conducted in English."
AFST 43782,"Together with the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean have been among the most influential exporters of music globally since the early 20th century. This course traces these processes of musical production and consumption. Students will be introduced to important historical and stylistic musical developments as we survey various styles and genres with attention to their cultural significance - including the corrido (Mexican ballad), Caribbean-derived salsa, and cumbia, among others. Our approach, such that we are dealing with music-cultures, is at once anthropological and ethnomusicological. In order we achieve our aims, the course is organized along two axes: one chronological (so to speak), the other conceptual, neither complete. The chronological portion will allow us to survey various genres and ensembles of musical production. We dovetail this effort with a focus on important themes and concepts that aid in understanding the present and historical conditions of the terrain where performance, identity, race-ethnicity, gender, transnationalism, and commoditized publics intersect."

ALHN 20000,"This course will engage students in the art and craft of writing for the public. Students will closely analyze works of creative nonfiction (personal essay, memoir, op-eds, columns, and long-form narrative journalism) by scholars and public intellectuals from across the Humanities, Social Sciences, and STEM fields that were written not for scholarly, peer-reviewed journals, but for blogs, online newsletters, and general audience magazines. Textual analysis will be undertaken with an eye toward the structural, stylistic, and rhetorical decisions made by the writers, in order for students to expand their own understanding of what is creatively possible for them as scholars and writers, and what is possible when it comes to the real-world impact of scholarly research. Course readings will be treated as literary texts whose intent is to educate, elucidate, and raise awareness in the general public (i.e. those outside of the discipline-specific discourse communities scholars tend to inhabit) about issues that the general reader might not have access to or feel intimidated by. Analysis of the readings will in turn provide models and motivation for students to write their own works of nonfiction connecting their scholarly interests to public concerns. "

To achieve these goals, students will meet and hear the stories of business professionals from diverse fields. They will also complete online diagnostic exercises and self-reflection activities, including drawing upon resources from Beyond the Dome and the Career Center. Additionally, students will create, workshop, and present a professional pitch deck, an email boilerplate to send to employers, and a one-minute ‘Who am I?’ to present to the class."
ALSF 30126,"If you are in this course - and the whole Sheedy Family Program - it is because you are seeking something. You have questions like, How can I connect my business major with my minor in psychology, or Spanish, or economics? Where can I learn the moral standards that will guide my actions in the business world? What do I tell my well-meaning relatives when they ask of my liberal arts major, What are you going to do with that? How are degrees in business and the liberal arts mutually enriching - a sum greater than the parts situation? Those questions are the reasons that this course, the gateway course in the Sheedy Family Program in Economy, Enterprise, and Society, exists. Together, we'll probe big philosophical questions related to the SFP's three key terms: economy, enterprise, and society. You'll learn to dialogue with peers - a vital real world skill with deep roots in the liberal arts - and to flexibly integrate ideas from across disciplines. You'll grapple with texts in genres from ancient philosophy to modernist poetry to contemporary film. We look forward to thinking in community with you. This course is limited to students accepted into the Sheedy Family Program."

AMST 30105,"This CAD course looks back to 1850, when urban industrial America began, and looks forward to 2050, when Notre Dame promises to be carbon neutral, to critically engage competing visions of individual, communal, and ecological flourishing.  It focuses on economic, racial, and environmental justice as students explore how US political culture, the discipline of American Studies, and Catholic social teaching have clashed and converged and Americans proposed varying solutions to poverty, racism, and environmental degradation.   After an introduction to American Studies, we turn to visions of the good life in foundational US political documents (the Declaration, the Constitution, and Inaugural Addresses) and in Catholic tradition (scriptural passages, theological essays, and papal encyclicals, from Rerum Novarum to Laudato Si'). Then the course's three main sections consider, in turn, economic equity, racial justice, and environmental restoration. Each section includes a faith in action case study and concludes with an integrative essay that puts Catholic social teaching into conversation with American Studies scholarship. In the final class session, Learning Groups present their synthesis of the course material, and, during the exam period, each student submits a final integrative essay that focuses on one of the issues—poverty, racism, or environmental degradation—and identifies what American Studies might learn from the Catholic Tradition and what the Catholic Tradition might learn from American Studies. "
AMST 30107,"This course examines the nineteenth and twentieth century histories of print and cultural manufacturing in the U.S., with special attention given to readers, writers, media producers, and distribution. By tracing how literature, broadly defined, has influenced the shape and reshaping of modern life, our primary goal for the semester will be to better understand the role and impact of intellectual transmission on civil society, formal politics, and cultural standards. Related topics we will investigate include the development and growth of American children's literature; the history of racial and ethnic authorship; the rise of industrial publishing; national and transnational censorship; and legacies of master communicators to mass audiences (e.g. Franklin Roosevelt with radio, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan with television, and Donald Trump with Twitter). Course readings and film screenings will range from William Llloyd Garrison's abolitionist newspaper, The Liberator, Matthew Rubery's The Untold Story of the Talking Book, Catherine Fisk's Writing for Hire: Unions, Hollywood, and Madison Avenue, James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time, Capote, and The Social Network."
AMST 30111,"Disability has long been constructed as the opposite of higher education. Universities are places that valorize, even demand, physical and intellectual ability. Disability, in turn, is often seen as something that does not fit within a university context, a problem that must be fixed. This antithetical relationship between disability and the university is rooted in history—eugenical curriculums, research programs that study disabled people—but it continues today. Despite a growing focus on diversity in university admissions and populations, disabled students enter higher education at a lower rate than non-disabled students and are less likely to graduate. In addition, universities perpetuate cultures of ableism in both faculty and students by prioritizing ability, perfection, and achievement. This course interrogates the relationship between disability and higher education with a special focus on our university, Notre Dame. Students will be introduced to fundamental principles in disability studies; explore the place of disability in higher education; and, drawing on scholarship in critical university studies, consider intersections between ableism, racism, and sexism in university contexts. Students will also think and learn about what inclusive and accessible education might look like. The course will conclude with a student-driven project designed to increase access, inclusiveness, and awareness about ableism and disability at Notre Dame."
AMST 30117,"This course will explore modern conspiracy theories in and about the United States, discovering what they tell us about American culture and politics. The truth we will be seeking will not necessarily be whether secret forces have ever conspired or currently conspire to influence specific world events, but what conspiracy theorizing can tell us about modern American identities, communities, and social hierarchies including race, gender, class, religion, and national origin. In other words, we will take theories of conspiracy seriously as vernacular narratives that contribute to collective identity formation, produce powerful symbolic systems for ordering and inverting hierarchies, and help communities negotiate differences of identity and background. Beginning with the Cold War and moving on to the War on Terror, we will discuss why some theories gain preeminence in certain historical contexts and among different social groups. In addition, we will interrogate the role the label conspiracy theory plays within contemporary dynamics of knowledge/power. What types of knowledge are respected and acceptable and what types are stigmatized and mocked, and why?  This is a writing-intensive course requiring over 20-pages of written work, including 3 small writing assignments, a series of graded and ungraded assignments leading to a major research paper, and an original research paper."
AMST 30119,"This class will survey the various historical and contemporary dimensions of Asian American experiences including immigration and integration, family and community dynamics, ethnic/gender/class identity, as well as transnational and diasporic experiences. We will explore contemporary and historical issues of racism, the model minority myth, inter-generational relationships, and the educational experiences of Asian Americans. To accomplish this, our class will pose such questions as: Who is Asian American? How did racism create Chinatown? Is there an Asian advantage? Coursework includes essays based on topics of your choice, presentations, and a creative narrative."
AMST 30122,"This course is about telling great, factual stories within the realm of human endeavor we call sport. That is, you will read and write substantial nonfiction narratives, and your main subject of inquiry will be near-at-hand happenings in sport, play, and performance. You can call it longform sportswriting, literary journalism, creative nonfiction, or anything in between—and, indeed, this course will ask you to interrogate the boundaries between subgenres in the literature of fact. Through your ethical efforts in research, exploration, and storytelling, you will seek to define and describe real-world truth through the art of the longform essay. With guidance, you will look for potential stories locally—on campus, or nearby—request access and permission to tell those stories, and gather material en route to crafting meaningful narratives. Together, we will ask fundamental questions about the time-honored act of storytelling and explore the history of the longform narrative form. What impact—culturally, socially, politically—can a well-told story have? We will build personal toolkits for writing nonfiction while reading and discussing exemplary essays. We will ask big questions about the role of sport and play in culture, mindful of local significance: What is the relationship between play and identity, for instance? How do conceptions of race, class, or gender find expression (or deconstruction) in sport? How does socioeconomic division affect access to sport and play in America? Most fundamentally, in this course, we will write and share our work with others. This course requires the completion of a substantial writing project, among other assignments, and you should be prepared to spend time with real people and your writing subjects outside of class time, and often according to their schedules."
AMST 30132,"In 2023, it is difficult to avoid the language of antiracism, and harder still to discern its politics. Is racism a matter of structure or intention? Culture or economics? What does racial justice look like? And what exactly are those structures anyways? Moving from the civil rights movement of the 1960s to the George Floyd Uprisings of 2020, this course introduces students to the history behind a freighted term. We will read classic and contemporary texts of antiracism, tracking how American activists, politicians, artists, and scholars wrestled with these questions in the twilight years of the welfare state, mass industry, and securely waged employment. "
AMST 30134,"This course examines the recent history of the American university. It asks how the last four decades of political-economic restructuring often described as “neoliberalism” – skyrocketing personal debt, privatization of public goods, and more – have reshaped its social function and institutional structure, its labor struggles and relation to local communities. Through readings in critical university studies, ethnic studies, and American literature, we will build a conceptual vocabulary to critically engage these transformations and, in the process, ask fundamental questions about the modern university: what it is, who it is for, and what it might yet be."
AMST 30145,"Nearly one in four people is an immigrant or child of immigrants in the United States. This course critically examines what it means to be an immigrant or child of immigrants through interdisciplinary sources, including memoirs, blogs, art, and popular journalism. Since the liberalization of immigration policy in 1965, immigrants from Latin America and Asia are becoming an increasing and emergent demographic of American society. In major American cities such as Los Angeles and New York, they comprise over 50% of the population. This course focuses on how immigrants and the children of immigrants experience the United States. How are immigrants changing the US racial and ethnic structure? How do their experiences differ, given varying legal statuses? How is the second generation becoming American? We will explore these questions through family, media representation, religion, education, dating, and sexuality. Students will participate in a service-learning opportunity related to migration and social justice and learn skills in quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Service learning will be 2-3 hours outside of class each week."
AMST 30150,"This course aims to change the way you think not only about the way that we play games, but also about the way that video games teach their players to behave within their digital worlds. This course will encourage students to reflect on and utilize their lived experiences as players, and utilize these experiences to locate themselves within their analysis and writing as well as their design practices. This course will undertake an intensive, interdisciplinary focus on the history of video game development, representation in video games, and the languages that digital games work in as well as decolonial theory and diverse theories of design. This class will engage with a variety of scholarly texts, video games, media posts, videos, and design exercises, in order to illustrate the ways in which video games have shaped the ways we play, think, and behave within their spaces. Students will be required to write and design around these lessons and address and push back against the problematic behaviors and colonial narratives around violence, race, gender, sexuality, and relationship to the land that these gamic languages and lessons have created. "
AMST 30161,"Football is one of the most enduringly popular and significant cultural activities in the United States. Since the late 19th century, football has occupied an important place for those wishing to define and understand America. And Notre Dame football plays a central role in that story, with larger-than-life figures and stories, from Knute Rockne's Win one for the Gipper line to the 'Four Horsemen' backfield that led the program to a second national championship in 1924. The mythic proportions of the University's football program cast a long shadow on the institution's history, cultural significance, and traditions. This course focuses on Notre Dame football history as an entry point into larger questions about the cultural, historical, and social significance of football in the U.S. Who has been allowed to play on what terms? How have events from Notre Dame football's past been remembered and re-imagined? How has success in Notre Dame football been defined and redefined? In particular, the course will focus on how Notre Dame football became a touchstone for Catholic communities and institutions across the country navigating the fraught terrain of immigration, whiteness, and religious practice. This course will take up those questions through significant engagement with University Archive collections related to Notre Dame football, working toward increased levels of description and access for these materials. This course will include hands-on work with metadata, encoding and markup, digitization, and digital preservation/access through a collaboration with the University Archives and the Navari Family Center for Digital Scholarship. Readings for this course will include chapters from texts such as Murray Sperber's Shake Down the Thunder: The Creation of Notre Dame Football (1993), TriStar Pictures' Rudy (1993), Steve Delsohn's Talking Irish: The Oral History of Notre Dame Football (2001), Jerry Barca's Unbeatable: Notre Dame's 1988 Championship and the Last Great College Football Season (2014), David Roediger's Working Toward Whiteness: How America's Immigrants Became White (2005), David Roediger's The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class (1991), and Noel Ignatiev's How the Irish Became White (1995). Class meetings will be split between discussions of conceptual readings and applied work with library and information science technologies and systems. Coursework may include response papers, hands-on work with data, and a final project. Familiarity with archival methods, library/information science, data science, or computer science tools and methods is NOT a prerequisite for this course."
AMST 30162,"This course will survey the history of representations of Latinos in American cinema from the silent era to the present.  We will examine how stereotypes associated with Latinos have been produced, reinforced, and challenged in American films - from greasers and Latin lovers to gangsters, kingpins, and border crossers.  We will explore the fascinating contradiction that, despite a long history of misrepresentation and under representation, Latinos have made significant contributions to Hollywood and independent cinema.  We will also examine the rise of Latino directors in recent years and their drive to reframe the Latino image for American audiences.  Screenings will range from the silent epic Martyrs of the Alamo (1915) to more recent films such as Maria Full of Grace (2004).  Our interdisciplinary approach to the subject will draw upon readings from history, film theory and criticism, and ethnic/American studies.  Students will take a midterm exam and make class presentations."
AMST 30165,"How did the most divisive war in American History shape the nation's biggest church community? This course explores Catholics as both supporters and detractors of the Vietnam War. American Catholics wished to see America defeat Communism but, importantly, the power of faith motivated many to criticize the state's escalation of the conflict. Students will explore the tensions and transformations of this important moment in American life. Lectures and classroom discussions will address decolonization, the global and national nature of American Catholicism, the power of the liberal state, conscientious objection, the Spirit of the Sixties, sacramental protests, the rise of human rights, geopolitics, and the Cold War. Course readings will include the latest scholarship, but also primary sources like poems, films, songs, letters, prayers, newspaper articles, and art. Students will have access to the rich materials of Catholic peace activists found in the University of Notre Dame Archives."
AMST 30186,"This course will examine the global field of Indigenous Cinema. This class will utilize screenings of Indigenous film along with accompanying lecture, reading, and discussion, to examine the ways in which Indigenous filmmakers, actors, and communities are subverting genre and decolonizing the industry to tell and reclaim Indigenous stories and make room for Indigenous futures."
AMST 30190,"This course introduces students to the history of religion in the lands that became the United States.  it focuses on how diverse peoples imagined and transformed the landscape, interacted with one another at different sites, and moved within and across borders.  It is divided into two main sections.  We begin --and end--by asking: How should we tell the story of religion in America?  To help students clarify their thinking and provide them with a wide variety of intriguing sources, the next two sections introduce different ways to tell that story--by chronology or theme.  Section one provides an historical overview, telling the story of U.S. religion by tracing chronological shifts, and we turn in the next section to explore a series of theses drawing on varied sources from multiple groups and historical periods.  The topics we discuss in that section include gender, sexuality, science, class, race, ethnicity, violence, politics, pluralism, and law.  Along the way, students plan and write a research paper on a topic of their choice and present their findings to the class.  At the end, we circle back to the questions we posted at the start-how do we tell the story of U.S. religion?-as we write our own narrative on the last day of class."
AMST 30192,"Sports play a big role in American culture. From pick up soccer and the Baraka Bouts to fantasy football and the Olympics, sports articulate American identities, priorities, aspirations, and concerns. They reflect our dominant values but also highlight our divisions and serve as a means to question those values. Athletes, organizers, spectators, fans, and the media all have a stake. This course will examine sport's role in American society and culture thematically, covering the late 19th century to present and paying special attention to sport as a physical performance (including issues of danger, drugs, disability, spectatorship, and fandom), sport as an expression of identity (the construction of race, gender, class, community, and nation), sport as a form of labor (with issues of power and control, safety, and amateurism), and sport as a cultural narrative (how do writers, historians, and the media attach meaning to it?). We will examine history, journalism, documentary film, and television coverage; topics will range from Victorian bicyclists and early college football to Muhammad Ali.  Requirements include reading and regular discussion, a variety of short analytical papers, and a culminating project in which students will choose one course theme to analyze through a topic of their own choice."
AMST 30201,"Description: In this course, we will examine writers who engage ghosts, haunting, and the supernatural to explore how oppressive systems of power, though pervasive, are rendered imperceptible due to their historical persistence. We will unpack how writers engage with ghosts and the supernatural to interrogate issues of power, gender, race, sexuality, and class. We will critically examine what these classed, gendered, and raced intersections reveal to us about American culture, ideology, history, identity, and future trajectories. We will interrogate, reflect, and deconstruct how writers affirm, challenge, and negotiate identity and conceptualize American society through their engagement with ghosts."
AMST 30203,"Considering the contemporary rise in the aesthetics of the genre of black horror, this course will explore literary and artistic horror(s) that black artists examine in America. We will work to study how black horror reminds us of the power of crafting narratives in America. We will be watching numerous horror films and shows and reading numerous literary authors. We will be reading and working with authors like: Toni Morrison, Richard Wright, Gwendolyn Brooks, James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, and many others. A close observation of this genre will allow us to question what constitutes horror and how is it connected to the humanities, law, and elements of science as well? This course is designed to help you build sound critical arguments and analysis by writing multiple genres of essays like a narrative essay, a close analysis essay, a podcast essay, and a final research essay."
AMST 30204,"In this course we will undertake a comparative survey of the materialisms of twentieth-century American naturalist novels, tracing a trajectory from turn-of-the-century texts by Frank Norris and Stephen Crane, to the neo-naturalist fiction of a few decades later that operated alongside developments in modernist literary form (Gertrude Stein, Ann Petry, John Steinbeck), and concluding with a look at its postwar resurgence in the novels of authors such as Don DeLillo and Cormac McCarthy. We will also discuss the return to these novels in recent films including There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men. Students will be asked to write one short formal analysis and two mid-length papers, in addition to regular discussion assignments."
AMST 30249,"Discussions of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century literary and cultural movement of Modernism often center on those qualities of the movement described in the work of early Modernist literary critics, such as Harry Levin or Edmund Wilson.  Such examinations emphasize the Modern movement's experiments in form, structure, linguistic representation, characterization, etc., while paying much less attention to the role of the Modernist movement in the larger context of a given culture.  In this course, we will explore the significance of the Modern movement from the perspective of American culture, as well as the manner and meaning of American literary participation in the movement.  To that end, we will consider not only the work of authors generally accepted as Modernists, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein; we will also consider the role of authors such as Sherwood Anderson and Waldo Frank, of the early Chicago Renaissance (1910 - 1925), and a number of authors from the Harlem Renaissance.  We will examine the work of these authors not only in the context of Modernism, but also as it relates to many issues of the day, including progressivism, primitivism, race and ethnicity, immigration, cosmopolitanism vs. regionalism, and the importance of the vernacular, in addition to the question of Americanness and its importance to an understanding of American literature during this time.   Considering these different vantage points in American literary Modernism, we will try to imagine the contours of American Modernisms, and draw some conclusions about their significance within the larger Modernist context.  In so doing, we'll seek to arrive at a more comprehensive, more nuanced perspective on the meaning of the Modern in American literature and culture.  Course texts:  Edith Wharton, Age of Innocence; Willa Cather, O Pioneers!; Sherwood Anderson, Dark Laughter; Waldo Frank, Holiday; Theodore Dreiser, Sister Carrie; Ernest Hemingway, Torrents of Spring; F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby; Gertrude Stein, Three Lives; Jessie Fauset, Plum Bun; Jean Toomer, Cane; William Faulkner, Absalom! Absalom!  Course Requirements:  Two 10-page essays, one mini-presentation, one larger presentation"

AMST 30332,"The 19th century witnessed a transformation in the understanding of the origins of criminal behavior in the United States. For many, a religious emphasis on humankind as sinful gave way to a belief in its inherent goodness. But if humans were naturally good, how could their evil actions be explained? Drawing on studies done here and abroad, American doctors, preachers, and lawyers debated whether environment, heredity, or free will determined the actions of the criminal. By the early 20th century, lawyers and doctors had largely succeeded in medicalizing criminality. Psychiatrists treated criminals as patients; judges invoked hereditary eugenics in sentencing criminals. Science, not sin, had apparently become the preferred mode of explanation for the origins of crime. But was this a better explanation than what had come before?   "
AMST 30362,"This course explores the relationships among and between workers, employers, government policymakers, unions, and social movements since the end of World War II, as well as the ways in which those relationships have shaped and been shaped by American politics and culture more broadly. The United States emerged from the Second World War as the globe's unequaled economic and political power, and its citizens parlayed that preeminence into a long postwar economic boom that created, however imperfectly, the first truly mass middle-class society in world history. At the heart of that new society was the American labor movement, whose leaders and members ensured that at least some of the heady postwar profits made it into the wallets of workers and their families - and not just the wallets of union members, as working Americans generally experienced great improvement in wages, benefits, and economic opportunity during the quarter-century ending in 1970.  During those same years, civil rights activists challenged the historic workplace discrimination that kept African Americans at the bottom of the labor market, confronting the racism of employers, unions, and the government, and inspiring others, primarily Mexican-Americans and women, to broaden the push for equality at the workplace.  Since that time, however, Americans have experienced a transformation in the workplace -- an erosion of manufacturing and the massive growth of service and government work; a rapid decline in number of union members and power of organized labor; and unresolved conflicts over affirmative action to redress centuries of racial and gender discrimination.  Meanwhile, income inequality and wealth disparities have grown every year over the past three decades. What accounts for the decline of organized labor since 1970, and why have the people of the mythic land of milk and honey experienced declining upward mobility and widening gaps between the rich and everyone else?  Are these phenomena linked?  What has the decline of the labor movement meant for workers specifically, and the American economy and politics more broadly? How and why have popular perceptions of unions changed over time? What has been the relationship of organized labor to the civil rights movement, feminism, modern conservatism, and the fortunes of individual freedom more broadly? What is globalization, and what has been its impact upon American workers? Through an exploration of historical scholarship, memoirs, polemical writings, and films, this course will try to answer these questions and many others.  It will also address the prospects for working people and labor unions in the twenty-first century.  This course satisfies the university history requirement and is open to all students; no previous knowledge of the topic is required."
AMST 30416,"This course is designed to introduce students to important historical and stylistic musical developments as part of the cultural experience of ethnic Mexicans in the United States. To this end, we examine both music-making and performance as aesthetic dialects of the social texture of everyday life. We will cover various styles and genres, including corridos (the Mexican ballad form), Chicano rock 'n- roll and hip-hop, jazz, and contemporary folk-derived styles (i.e. Banda, Pasito Duranguense, Norteño) with attention to their historical, political, and musical significance. In order we achieve our aims, the course is organized along two axes: one chronological, the other conceptual - neither complete. The chronological portion will allow us to survey the various genres, styles, and ensembles of ethnic Mexican musical production. We dovetail this effort with a focus on important themes and concepts, identity, race, gender, migration, hybridity, that pertain to the present and historical social conditions of this community. Our approach, such that we are dealing with music-cultures, is at once anthropological and ethnomusicological, yet we are guided more broadly, by the paradigm of cultural studies, as we interrogate the expressive terrain where history, language, performance, and social bodies intersect."
AMST 30435,"This seminar course explores the intersection of the physical realities of urban environments, race, and education and will be a question based seminar.  As a group we will work to answer a cluster of questions surrounding the course topic in a systematic, interdisciplinary format.  Questions may include: How does the physical landscape/structure of schools matter to urban education?  How does the high concentration of poverty and racial segregation impact curriculum, school culture, and neighborhood? How do early childhood programming, college preparatory programs, and after school programs factor into the landscape of urban education? What are best practices involved with teaching in urban environments? The final question we will work on as a group will be: What are the implications of what we know about race and urban landscapes in propelling positive micro and macro level change for our educational system?   This course demands a high level of class participation and student initiative.  "
AMST 30460,"This course will examine the Latino experience in the United States, including the historical, cultural, and political foundations of Latino life. We will approach these topics comparatively, thus attention will be given to the various experiences of a multiplicity of Latino groups in the United States. This course has an optional community-engaged learning component with La Casa de Amistad."
AMST 30467,"Work on a real-world project that can impact Native American education in the present while learning the history that shaped the modern era. Native American Education is deeply intertwined with American history, education, and policy. The current American government is seriously investigating the past uses of education as a tool for assimilation (and worse) in Native American communities. In 2022 the Pope went to Canada and apologized for the role the Church played in the residential boarding schools, and the Subcommittee on Native American issues for the USCCB is investigating the same here in the United States. This course blends primary source historical work with active and engaging projects with Native communities to engage students in both history and historical thought to do consulting and problem-solving that will help shape real policy in the present day! This class promises to be like no other course you’ve had and get you working with others in truly collaborative manners very quickly in the semester. Not in ESS?

AMST 30480,"This course serves as a gateway for subsequent coursework in international security. It is a required course in the Notre Dame International Security Center's undergraduate certificate program requirements, but it is also appropriate for, and open to, any Notre Dame students interested in U.S. national security policymaking. It will begin with an account of the history and development of U.S. national security policy from the Founding through the present. Next, it examines the current state of the primary institutions involved in U.S. national security policymaking. Finally, it explores the tools and instruments of military statecraft as applied by the United States. The course culminates with a simulation exercise in which students will role-play key participants in the U.S. national security policymaking process. At a minimum, that students will gain from it the analytical tools, historical knowledge, and current-events background to become more informed citizens, particularly with respect to important national debates about when and how our country should use military force. At a maximum, the course may lead some students to become interested enough in the topic to pursue a career in either the practice or the study of U.S. national security policy.

AMST 30519,"Many have claimed that the American educational system is the great equalizer among men. In other words, the educational system gives everyone a chance to prosper in American society regardless of their social origins. In this course, we will explore the validity of this claim. Do schools help make American society more equal by reducing the importance of class, race, and gender as sources of inequality, or do schools simply reinforce existing inequalities and reproduce pre-existing social relations? Topics covered in the course include: unequal resources among schools, sorting practices of students within schools, parents' role in determining student outcomes, the role of schooling in determining labor market outcomes for individuals, and the use of educational programs as a remedy for poverty."
AMST 30604,"This course examines US engagement in hotspots across the Muslim world before and after 9/11. In particular focus are nations in South Asia and the Middle East: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq. We will also look at US relations with important Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, as well as policies toward Israel-Palestine and the Bosnian War in Europe. US engagement abroad takes many forms, including public diplomacy, trade, sanctions, alliances, covert operations, financial and military aid, and direct military intervention. What are the drivers of American decision-making in the region? Why is there so much anti-American sentiment in Muslim societies? Does peace depend on a critical reassessment of US foreign policy or the reform of a radical Islamist theology? Do certain interpretations of religion make conflict inevitable, or is it possible to attain reasonable outcomes even when dealing with extremists? Through a blend of history, investigative journalism, case studies, opinion polls, literature, and film, this course broadens our perspectives on some of America's longest wars in the Muslim world."
AMST 30614,"This course introduces students to the diversity of cultures living in the American Southwest from the earliest Paleoindians (11,500 years ago) to European contact, the establishment of Spanish Missions, and the Pueblo Revolt of 1680-1692. Most of the course is devoted to learning about the complex cultural developments in the Mimbres Valley, Chaco Canyon, Mesa Verde, the Rio Grande, and the Phoenix Basin. Class work and discussions will focus on important issues such as the adoption of agriculture, the development of villages, the transformation of ideological beliefs and political organization, the importance of migration, and the impact of warfare using information on environmental relationships, technology, and other aspects of material culture. Students will also learn about descendant populations living in the Southwest today including the Pueblo peoples (e.g., Hopi, Santa Clara, Acoma) and Tohono O'odham."
AMST 30824,"This course offers an in-depth analysis of the roles of structural and cultural violence in peace studies. Unit 1 (conceptual/theoretical) explores field-formative debates over the nature, basis, and viability of structural violence and cultural violence as analytical concepts, asking how they have shaped (or failed to, but perhaps ought to shape) the field of peace studies. We will examine their critical appropriations of early critical theory, and assess comparable theoretical approaches such as reflexive sociology (Pierre Bourdieu and Loic Wacquant), post-structural analysis (Michel Foucault), and later critical theory (Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth) while asking what advantages, if any, lenses of structural and cultural violence have vis-à-vis these resources for peace analysis and peacebuilding, and where they need to be supplemented. Unit 2 (cases/agents) studies cases in which some version of these analytical lenses have been deployed for purposes of peace analysis and peacebuilding. We examine recent uses of these lenses to examine poverty, global development, and global health in building peace (e.g. Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Paul Farmer, Peter Uvin), religious/cultural identity (Veena Das), and race, class, and gender (Joshua Price on incarceration and prison abolition in the U.S; Alex Mikulich and Laurie Cassidy on white complicity in hyper incarceration)."
AMST 30902,"Food access, equity and justice should be of great importance to everyone. Consistently there has been political, economic, geographic and flawed distribution supply chains within the domestic food system. This interdisciplinary course will utilize digital humanities tools and platforms for students to express their research interests. We will analyze the impact that human actions have on foodways, or the social, cultural, and economic practices of producing and consuming food in relation to race, equity and access, historically and currently. We will explore alternative courses of action toward viable, ethical, and antiracist solutions to questions about sustainable farming, global economic inequality, and hunger. Throughout the semester, participants will use the lens of race and ethnicity to study and discuss how these two concepts affect access to agricultural land, foodstuffs /foodways, environmental justice and nature."

AMST 30922,"This course will follow the evolution of housing in the context of American Urbanism over the last hundred years and explore not only the methods employed to discriminate against minority communities, but also how these policies have ended up failing the suburban and rural communities they were intended to privilege. Consequently, the outcomes are not only ongoing racial injustice but also a nationwide affordable housing crisis and crumbling infrastructure. The course will be broken down into three parts. We will explore the history and evolution of housing segregation; the current results of decades of racist policies and actions; as well as potential ideas to reverse the inequities in housing to create a stronger future for all communities. No existing knowledge of architecture or urbanism is required."

AMST 43145,"Sports and recreation are a huge part of American life. What we do for fun reflects who we are and what we aspire to be as individuals, as members of a group or subculture, and as a nation. Amusement parks, city parks, national parks, stadiums, and sports fields shape the built and natural world around us; sports media, outdoor recreation, and tourism represent billion-dollar industries and influence American politics and culture. Because sports and recreation foster community and identity, they also become sites of conflict. As a result, they provide a useful lens for examining major themes and questions integral to the field of American Studies. Just as Introduction to American Studies served as your gateway to the major, this seminar will be the culminating experience. Readings and assignments will explore research and scholarship examining sports and recreation in the context of American Studies as a field, and students will develop research projects on a topic of their own choice. Requirements will include seminar-style discussions of assigned readings, a final research project of 20-25 pages, and an oral presentation of that project in class, as well as some smaller writing assignments."

It is only offered during fall semesters and should be followed in the spring by 3 credit hours of AMST 47910 Senior Thesis Writing with the thesis advisor. This course encourages students to think about how their coursework fits together as a whole and gives them an opportunity to put what they've learned as American Studies majors into practice. In this course students will be expected to demonstrate significant progress towards their senior thesis, a year-long experience developed with a faculty advisor that aspires to make an original contribution to the field. Class readings and discussions will address current issues and themes in the field of American Studies as well as how student theses will develop, support, or revise those themes. During the semester students will work on refining a topic and developing a supporting bibliography, conducting a significant amount of research (whether in libraries or in the field), situating their research among relevant secondary sources, writing an abstract or prospectus to guide further research and writing in the spring, and planning the project's final form (paper, exhibit, documentary, etc.). Specific expectations for each project/student will be developed in consultation with the course instructor and the student's thesis advisor. It is expected that each student meet at least twice with their thesis advisor during the semester. This course will be graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis."
ANTH 10109,This course deals with the nature of anthropology as a broad and diverse area of study.

ANTH 10110,"Can the secrets of the past help us solve our problems in the future? This course uncovers the clues that our ancestors left behind in ruins, abandoned cities, pyramids, and on the earth itself. We will discuss key issues facing humanity today through the lens of the past. How prone are we as a species to degrading our environment? How flexible are we in the face of environmental change? Are humans basically violent, and are we destined to keep killing each other? These are some of the big questions that can be addressed using the archaeological record. The anthropological and archaeological study of past failure (and success) can help us understand the urgent challenges our our own age."
ANTH 10112,"Creole is spoken by an estimated seventeen million people.  Creole is spoken on the islands of the Caribbean and the western Indian Ocean that were former or current French colonial possessions and in the countries where many of these former island residents have emigrated, including the United States, Canada, France, Dominican Republic, Bahamas and other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean.  Haitians are the largest Creole speech community of approximately eleven and a half million speakers.  Creole language courses provide a valuable foundation for Notre Dame faculty, staff and students working to understand and address critical issues related to Haiti and the Francophone world, from language and culture to history and education, from engineering to public health.  Creole language and literature are of increasing interest in the dynamic field of Francophone studies.  Creole has also become a major area in the field of linguistics, especially in areas of language evolution, sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology.   Students attend class with an instructor (T-TH) and work on-line (MWF). The instructor will balance both spoken and written Creole as well as exercise reading and listening."
ANTH 10195,"Human beings may be classified as one species among many in biological terms, although a strict physical determination marks only the starting point for a broad inquiry into what we mean by human nature. Anthropology moves forward from this beginning to explore, in theory and by empirical investigation, the particular forms of cultural expression that characterize the development of human societies and account for their richness and their remarkable variety. This course examines the fundamental elements of this fascinating social science. It addresses the sometimes-controversial evidence related to such questions as evolution and genetics, as well as issues of ecological adaptation and the emergence of complex societies. It looks into language and other symbolic systems as central components of distinctively human behavior. It concentrates with special emphasis on the vast domain of social and cultural life, drawing upon many ethnographic examples from near and far, to illustrate how anthropologists seek to study all dimensions of human experience, from kinship to kingship and from cyborgs to shamans. Seminar format."
ANTH 10202,"This course is an introduction to the methods, goals, and theoretical concepts of archaeology, with a primary focus on anthropological archaeology practiced in the Middle East, North America, and Europe. The field of archaeology is broadly concerned with material culture (at times combined with textual information) that can be employed to generate interpretations about past human societies. The challenge of this social science is to interpret past societies and anthropological behavior using the fragmentary, but nonetheless rich and complex, data base of the archaeological record. Lecture topics will include the methods and goals of archaeological excavation; analytical techniques employed in material studies; and the problems and challenges in the interpretation of past human behavior. Case studies of survey, excavation, and analytical techniques will focus on recent or on-going investigations of archaeological sites in North America, Central America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East."
ANTH 10203,"This class is designed to introduce anthropology as a lens to analyze the human condition and the diversity of human expression. We will also identify key topical themes and interests in cultural anthropology including an overview of its history and methods. Anthropology illuminates the myriad of cultural patterns and social systems throughout the world. Expressed through ethnography, anthropology reveals a vast variety of global cultural phenomena that reveal complex social patterns and the stunning vibrancy of ways we can live and view life. The course explores human action through multiple holistic lenses including culture concepts, kinship patterns, economic strategies, political practices, religious rituals, artistic performances, gender roles, ethnic identities, communicative languages, medical systems, patterns of violence, and the legacies of globalization."
ANTH 10204,"Language is fully embedded in human culture and society. It has both meaning and efficacy; that is, it both means things and does things. Our goal in this course is to become aware of some of the ways language functions in social life, often below the level of awareness of its users. Students will engage in a number of practical exercises that demonstrate some of the more astonishing features of language all around us. Topics include: the nature of language, including language origins, nonverbal communication, and electronic communication; language, culture, and thought (linguistic relativity); speech acts and what we do with words; conversational analysis; language and identity (class, race, gender); and language in the world (multilingualism, language endangerment and revitalization, language and education)."
ANTH 10210,"Have you ever pondered how people live(d) in a world without television, YouTube, smartphones, and automobiles? Why have bellbottoms come and gone twice in the last 50 years? Will we be forced to relive the fashion mistakes of the 1970s and 1980s? What new stuff will people invent and sell next? In asking and answering these questions, we must focus on one underlying query: What does our stuff really say about who we are and who we want to be? This course combines lectures, discussions, and interactive small group activities to explore the nature and breadth of peoples' relationships with their things. We will investigate why and how people make and use different types of objects, and how the use of these material goods resonates with peoples' identities in the deep past, recent history, and today. Since everyone in the class will already be an expert user and consumer of things, we will consider how people today use material objects to assert, remake, reclaim, and create identities, and compare today's practices to those of people who lived long ago. Class members will learn about how anthropologists, including ethnographers (studying people today) and archaeologists (studying past peoples) think about and approach the material nature of our social, economic, and political lives. We will discuss why styles and technologies change through time, and why, in the end, there is very little new under the sun in terms of human behaviors and the way people produce and consume goods. The topical breadth of this workshop encompasses most social science disciplines, including history, economics, psychology, and anthropology, and resonates with classics, art history, and gender studies."

You will investigate the scientific study of language (a.k.a. Linguistics), with an emphasis on developing the basic vocabulary and analytical skills associated with the major branches of linguistic research."
ANTH 20093,"MATERIALS FEE. Traditionally, design has been used to connote the process by which the physical artifacts of the objects and communications around us come into being. But over the last decade, design has come more and more to describe not only the development of objects but the process by which one shapes the interactions and experiences of people with the systems, services and organizations around us. A deeply human-centered approach to problem solving, design thinking is centered around identifying and reframing complex problems, and solving them through a more creative, iterative and hands-on approach. This course will follow a series of overlapping modules that will introduce the student to the various steps employed in the design thinking process and becoming familiar with the tools and methodologies used. The course will feature a hybrid seminar format with lectures and case studies followed by hands-on exercises and practical applications of the theories in the form of team projects. At the conclusion of the course, students should be able to articulate the tenants of the design thinking process and apply those methodologies to problems of a variety of disciplines from science and engineering to business and the liberal arts. If there are no seats available, please contact the art department (art@nd.edu) and the instructor to indicate interest and to sign-up for the waitlist. The course is the gateway for the Collaborative Innovation minor. Only students enrolled or having completed the course may sign up for the minor. There are only limited seats for juniors and no seats available for seniors with special approval."
ANTH 20109,This course deals with the nature of anthropology as a broad and diverse area of study. The anthropological study of humankind will be approached from the perspectives of physical anthropology; prehistory and archaeology; and linguistic anthropology and socio-cultural anthropology. The diversity of humankind will be explored in all its aspects from times past to the present.
ANTH 20201,"This course approaches human evolution from a theoretical point of view that combines both biological and cultural processes into a cohesive bio-cultural model. It begins by tracing the development of modern evolutionary theory and the place of evolutionary studies in anthropology, especially in the sub-field of bioanthropology. These concepts provide the framework for understanding the many lines of evidence that anthropologists use to explore and explain human evolution. These include studies of our primate relatives, through the intricacies of the fossil record, to archaeological evidence for the invention of material culture from the simplest stone tools to the complex cultural world that we live in today. Modern human variation can only be explained as the result of evolutionary forces acting on the complex interplay of biology and culture over millions of years. We continue to be affected by these forces, and this course not only provides information about where we came from, it also provides the scientific backgrounds to help us understand where we might be going as our species continues to evolve."
ANTH 20202,"This course is an introduction to the methods, goals, and theoretical concepts of archaeology, with a primary focus on anthropological archaeology practiced in the Middle East, North America, and Europe. The field of archaeology is broadly concerned with material culture (at times combined with textual information) that can be employed to generate interpretations about past human societies. The challenge of this social science is to interpret past societies and anthropological behavior using the fragmentary, but nonetheless rich and complex, data base of the archaeological record. Lecture topics will include the methods and goals of archaeological excavation; analytical techniques employed in material studies; and the problems and challenges in the interpretation of past human behavior. Case studies of survey, excavation, and analytical techniques will focus on recent or on-going investigations of archaeological sites in North America, Central America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East."
ANTH 20203,"This course introduces students to the field of social-cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropologists are primarily interested in exploring issues of human cultural diversity across cultures and through time. This course will explore key theoretical, topical, and ethical issues of interest to cultural anthropologists. We will examine diverse ways in which people around the globe have constructed social organizations (such as kinship, and political and economic systems) and cultural identities (such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, race, and class) and we will consider the impact of increasing globalization on such processes. Throughout the course we will consider how different anthropologists go about their work as they engage in research and as they represent others through the writing of ethnographies."
ANTH 20204,"Language is fully embedded in human culture and society. It has both meaning and efficacy; that is, it both means things and does things. Our goal in this course is to become aware of some of the ways language functions in social life, often below the level of awareness of its users. Students will engage in a number of practical exercises that demonstrate some of the more astonishing features of language all around us. Topics include: the nature of language, including language origins, nonverbal communication, and electronic communication; language, culture, and thought (linguistic relativity); speech acts and what we do with words; conversational analysis; language and identity (class, race, gender); and language in the world (multilingualism, language endangerment and revitalization, language and education)."
ANTH 20209,"Have you ever pondered how people live(d) in a world without television, YouTube, smartphones, and automobiles? Why have bellbottoms come and gone twice in the last 50 years? Will we be forced to relive the fashion mistakes of the 1970s and 1980s? What new stuff will people invent and sell next? In asking and answering these questions, we must focus on one underlying query: What does our stuff really say about who we are and who we want to be? This course combines lectures, discussions, and interactive small group activities to explore the nature and breadth of peoples' relationships with their things. We will investigate why and how people make and use different types of objects, and how the use of these material goods resonates with peoples' identities in the deep past, recent history, and today. Since everyone in the class will already be an expert user and consumer of things, we will consider how people today use material objects to assert, remake, reclaim, and create identities, and compare today's practices to those of people who lived long ago. Class members will learn about how anthropologists, including ethnographers (studying people today) and archaeologists (studying past peoples) think about and approach the material nature of our social, economic, and political lives. We will discuss why styles and technologies change through time, and why, in the end, there is very little new under the sun in terms of human behaviors and the way people produce and consume goods. The topical breadth of this workshop encompasses most social science disciplines, including history, economics, psychology, and anthropology, and resonates with classics, art history, and gender studies. "
ANTH 20320,"This course will serve as an introduction to the field of international development, with particular focus on the various disciplines that have contributed to and shaped the development discourse over the past eight decades.  Readings and lectures will draw from economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, environmental and technological sciences, public health and epidemiology, area studies, ethnic studies, and gender studies.  A large component of this course will focus on in-class discussions and presentations that engage the broader debates within development studies to critically evaluate the development discourse/process, as well as understand emerging critiques of international development.  Required course work will include group or individual student projects that critically investigate ongoing development issues and propose engaged solutions that include restoration and social justice and human dignity."
ANTH 20477,"This introductory course uses popular film as a primary text/medium to explore fundamental questions in the academic study of religion. In particular, we will be concerned with the ways that faith, spirituality, religion and religious experience are constituted and defined on film as well as through film viewing. Emphasis will be placed on film's reflecting African Diaspora culture and the inclusion of religions outside of the Judeo-Christian canon for context and comparison. In discussing films from across a range of subjects and genres, we will engage in the work of mythical, theological and ideological criticism, while examining the nature, function, and value of religion and religious experience. We will also consider significant writers and traditions in the field of Diaspora Religions and develop the analytical and interpretive skills of the discipline. Given the depth and breadth of religious orthodoxies and faith-based practices existent throughout the Diaspora, students will be exposed to a variety of film genres including silent films, anime, documentary, drama, biography, comedy and horror. Based on availability, and the student cohort's familiarity or lack of material the scheduled films will include twelve to fifteen selections from the lists below. Weekly readings, writing assignments, and screening sessions are required."
ANTH 20556,"This course introduces the interdisciplinary field of science and technology studies. Our concern will be with science and technology (including medicine) as social and historical, i.e., as human, phenomena. We shall examine the divergent roots of contemporary science and technology, and the similarities and (sometimes surprising) differences in their methods and goals. The central theme of the course will be the ways in which science and technology interact with other aspects of society, including the effects of technical and theoretical innovation in bringing about social change, and the social shaping of science and technology themselves by cultural, economic and political forces. Because science/society interactions so frequently lead to public controversy and conflict, we shall also explore what resources are available to mediate such conflicts in an avowedly democratic society."
ANTH 21093,"This once weekly lab session is a mandatory requirement for students enrolled in the Design Thinking course. These sessions focus on practical application of the topics and materials presented in class with students working in teams to employ techniques and methodology on assigned projects. This hands-on lab will having students exploring the research, brainstorming, ideation, iterative prototyping and presentation techniques that lead to creative innovation and disruptive breakthroughs applicable to students of any discipline.

ANTH 23201,"Organized violence between human communities is one of the unfortunate realities of human existence, and its causes and consequences have consequently been of great interest. Is war an inevitable outcome of human nature, or the result of specific social, historical, and environmental circumstances? Archaeology is uniquely positioned to provide concrete insights into the history of human violence through study of its direct material correlates?traumatic injuries on skeletons, fortified settlements, weaponry, and iconography. However, the archaeological record also documents the impacts of violence?reduced nutritional status and health, evidence for enslavement, cannibalism, and population decline?and can provide insights into why war occurred through examination of environment, population, and social conditions. In this course, we will explore what the archaeological record tells us about violence, human nature, and the veracity of claims for either a more violent or more peaceful past. We will examine theoretical models of war, anthropological studies of conflict, and archaeological case studies of both violent and peaceful times to understand the role that organized violence has played in human history and evolution."
ANTH 23316,"Together with the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean have been among the most influential exporters of music globally since the early 20th century. This course traces these processes of musical production and consumption. Students will be introduced to important historical and stylistic musical developments as we survey various styles and genres with attention to their cultural significance - including the corrido (Mexican ballad), Caribbean-derived salsa, and cumbia, among others. Our approach, such that we are dealing with music-cultures, is at once anthropological and ethnomusicological. In order we achieve our aims, the course is organized along two axes: one chronological (so to speak), the other conceptual, neither complete. The chronological portion will allow us to survey various genres and ensembles of musical production. We dovetail this effort with a focus on important themes and concepts that aid in understanding the present and historical conditions of the terrain where performance, identity, race-ethnicity, gender, transnationalism, and commoditized publics intersect."
ANTH 30112,"This course provides students with a critical understanding of how South Korean society is organized, the major social issues that have dominated the contemporary era, and how systems of social inequality have changed since the postwar period. We will analyze in particular, three major periods of social change, including 1) the democratization movement of the 1970s and 1980s, 2) the Asian financial crisis and its impact on social inequality and poverty, and finally, 3) South Korea’s aging crisis and its implications for the future. No prior knowledge of Asian languages or topics is required."
ANTH 30116,"How did the most divisive war in American History shape the nation's biggest church community? This course explores Catholics as both supporters and detractors of the Vietnam War. American Catholics wished to see America defeat Communism but, importantly, the power of faith motivated many to criticize the states escalation of the conflict. Students will explore the tensions and transformations of this important moment in American life. Lectures and classroom discussions will address decolonization, the global and national nature of American Catholicism, the power of the liberal state, conscientious objection, the Spirit of the Sixties, sacramental protests, the rise of human rights, geopolitics, and the Cold War. Course readings will include the latest scholarship, but also primary sources like poems, films, songs, letters, prayers, newspaper articles, and art. Students will have access to the rich materials of Catholic peace activists found in the University of Notre Dame Archives."
ANTH 30186,"This course will examine the global field of Indigenous Cinema. This class will utilize screenings of Indigenous film along with accompanying lecture, reading, and discussion, to examine the ways in which Indigenous filmmakers, actors, and communities are subverting genre and decolonizing the industry to tell and reclaim Indigenous stories and make room for Indigenous futures."
ANTH 30200,"What is psychic life? The word psyche has encompassed a range of definitions as it has travelled through time, from notions of mind, soul, spirit, and the conscious and unconscious mind, to a mirror, an asteroid discovered in 1852, a moth or butterfly, and anima mundi, the animating principle of the universe itself. Today an additional constellation of concepts may also be drawn into psyche's orbit, including brain, emotion, feeling, affect, self, subjectivity, person, ego, and experience. As opposed to terms like mental health, the concept of psychic life provides a language with which to speak about a range of phenomena across multiple traditions, epistemologies, and histories, without prioritizing any one conceptualization over another or locating the psyche within the boundaries of an individual mind, as distinct from the body and the world. Instead, in this course we will explore psychic life through the various ways in which it is known-as lived-experience; cultural, historical, and political form; object of intervention; and site of experimentation.   The approaches engaged in this course draw from psychological anthropology, ethnopsychology, critical global health, history of medicine, cultural studies, affect theory, psychoanalysis, and critical phenomenology with an overarching dedication to de-stigmatizing mental illness, and embracing neurodiversity in all its forms. Along the way we will cover topics including madness and reason, psychopolitics, global mental health, the governance of the self, the psychic life of racism, radical mental health collectives and the psychedelic renaissance, as well as a set of phenomena that lie at the limits of experience, such as psychosomatization, solitary confinement, oceanic feeling, and dreaming."
ANTH 30308,"This course offers an in-depth analysis of the roles of structural and cultural violence in peace studies. Unit 1 (conceptual/theoretical) explores field-formative debates over the nature, basis, and viability of “structural violence” and “cultural violence” as analytical concepts, asking how they have shaped (or failed to, but perhaps ought to shape) the field of peace studies. We will examine their critical appropriations of early critical theory, and assess comparable theoretical approaches such as reflexive sociology (Pierre Bourdieu and Loic Wacquant), post-structural analysis (Michel Foucault), and later critical theory (Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth) while asking what advantages, if any, lenses of structural and cultural violence have vis-à-vis these resources for peace analysis and peacebuilding, and where they need to be supplemented. Unit 2 (cases/agents) studies cases in which some version of these analytical lenses have been deployed for purposes of peace analysis and peacebuilding. We examine recent uses of these lenses to examine poverty, global development, and global health in building peace (e.g. Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Paul Farmer, Peter Uvin), religious/cultural identity (Veena Das), and race, class, and gender (Joshua Price on incarceration and prison abolition in the U.S; Alex Mikulich and Laurie Cassidy on white complicity in hyper incarceration)."
ANTH 30330,"The study of religious beliefs and practices in tribal and peasant societies emphasizing myths, ritual, symbolism, and magic as ways of explaining man's place in the universe. Concepts of purity and pollution, the sacred and the profane, and types of ritual specialists and their relation to social structure will also be examined."
ANTH 30558,"This course is designed to introduce students to a wide range of health issues affecting women globally, with particular emphasis on Africa, Asia, and the United States. The topics will focus on a woman's life, from infancy and childhood, through adolescence and reproductive years, to old age. We will examine the physiological, social, psychological, economic, cultural, political, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence women's health, and the role of poverty, discrimination, and unequal health access. Topics such as determinants of womenand#39;s health, reproductive health, sexual health, cardiovascular health, maternal health, cancers of the reproductive tract, mental and emotional health, substance use and abuse, and various forms of violence against women will be discussed. At the end of the course, students should have a solid grasp of key issues affecting the health of women in different cultural contexts globally, and how women can be empowered to take actions that positively influence their health."
ANTH 30592,"This course introduces students to the diversity of cultures living in the American Southwest from the earliest Paleoindians (11,500 years ago) to European contact, the establishment of Spanish Missions, and the Pueblo Revolt of 1680-1692. Most of the course is devoted to learning about the complex cultural developments in the Mimbres Valley, Chaco Canyon, Mesa Verde, the Rio Grande, and the Phoenix Basin. Class work and discussions will focus on important issues such as the adoption of agriculture, the development of villages, the transformation of ideological beliefs and political organization, the importance of migration, and the impact of warfare using information on environmental relationships, technology, and other aspects of material culture. Students will also learn about descendant populations living in the Southwest today including the Pueblo peoples (e.g., Hopi, Santa Clara, Acoma) and Tohono O'odham."
ANTH 30715,"Food access, equity and justice should be of great importance to everyone. Consistently there has been political, economic, geographic and flawed distribution supply chains within the domestic food system. This interdisciplinary course will utilize digital humanities tools and platforms for students to express their research interests. We will analyze the impact that human actions have on foodways, or the social, cultural, and economic practices of producing and consuming food in relation to race, equity and access, historically and currently. We will explore alternative courses of action toward viable, ethical, and antiracist solutions to questions about sustainable farming, global economic inequality, and hunger. Throughout the semester, participants will use the lens of race and ethnicity to study and discuss how these two concepts affect access to agricultural land, foodstuffs /foodways, environmental justice and nature."
ANTH 30800,"Almost 40% of the world's population is overweight or has obesity. Obesity has become a central focus in biological research as well as policy. Billions of dollars have been spent on public health interventions, biological interventions, diets, and exercise regimens. However, the obesity rate among adults and children has been steadily increasing globally. Why is this happening? How do we even define obesity? Does that definition truly reflect health? Why do we even have fat to begin with...actually what even is fat?!? Why are humans prone to obesity? These are just some of the questions we will address in this class. Using non-traditional methods and assignments, we will discuss adipose tissue and digestive physiology, the role evolution has played in the human propensity to hold onto fat, diet and exercise, food insecurity, therapeutic interventions, as well as the physical and mental health consequences of having obesity. We will use this as a basis to investigate the biological and cultural factors including stigma, race, and gender that shape our perceptions of body image and health in the midst of the obesity epidemic. Finally, this course will include occasional laboratory exercises to familiarize you with the methods used to assess body mass, body composition, metabolic rate, and point of care measures of biomarkers like glucose and cholesterol."
ANTH 30910,"The aim of this class is to try to understand what conquest, as we have traditionally called it, meant to the people who experienced it in some parts of the Americas that joined the Spanish monarchy in the sixteenth century. We'll concentrate on indigenous sources - documentary, pictorial, and material - and try to adopt the indigenous point of view, without neglecting sources mediated by Europeans. Although the class will concentrate on selected cases from Mesoamerica, the lecturer will try to set the materials in the context of other encounters, both within the Americas and further afield; and students will be free, if they wish, to explore case-studies from anywhere they choose in the Americas (in consultation with the lecturer and subject to his approval) in their individual projects.

ANTH 40200,"The goal of the course is to compare the processes by which social scientists and filmmakers/photographers engage in social documentation. Students explore how global social problems such as rural and urban poverty, race and gender inequalities, immigration, and violence are analyzed across the social sciences, and depicted in a variety of documentary film and photography genres. The course also explores the role that documentary photography and film play in promoting rights and advocating for social change, particularly in the realm of human rights and global inequality. It examines the history of documentary film and photography in relationship to politics, and to the development of concerns across the social sciences with inequality and social justice. It also looks at how individual documentarians, non-profit organizations and social movements use film and photography to further their goals and causes, and issues of representation their choices raise. The course is also unique because it requires students to engage in the process of visual documentation themselves by incorporating an activity-based learning component. For their final project, students choose a human rights or social problem that concerns or interests them (and which they can document locally - no travel is required), prepare a documentary -exhibit- on the chosen topic (10-12 photographs), and write a 12-15 page paper analyzing how 2-3 social scientists construct and frame the given problem. Students also have the option to produce a short documentary film."

ANTH 40313,"This course provides grounding in some of the methods of qualitative analysis present in the field of anthropology. The focus of the course is on developing skills that students can use to do systematic analysis of anthropological data. The perspective guiding the course is that anthropology is an empirical, scientific approach for describing social and cultural aspects of human life, and that qualitative data can be analyzed in systematic and rigorous ways. The course will explore a range of approaches and will cover analytic skills that cut across traditions, including theme identification, code definition, and pattern recognition. Advanced topics covered will include content analysis, text analysis, and schema analysis. Students will learn techniques and protocols in data arrangement and visualization that are appropriate for different analytical methods. It is a hands-on class where students will be able to work on data provided to them as well as on their own. Collaboration will be integral to the course success."
ANTH 40400,"Anthropology attempts to make sense of an infinitely complicated world by organizing its observations, inquiries, and explanations. Some of these are grand, while others are modest.  Still, all anthropological work involves some kind of analysis.  All analysis stems from a view of what is basic and of what is related most centrally. This course introduces the most powerful analytic perspectives in the four subdisciplines of anthropology, preparing students to encounter and situate anthropological works of all sorts. The seminar format encourages student involvement not only in reading and writing but also in discussion and analysis of the works under consideration.  Written and spoken assignments will permit students to try their hand at a wide range of anthropological practice. Required of all Anthropology majors.  To provide a theoretical background for later courses, anthropology students and faculty highly recommend taking this course in Junior year."
ANTH 40700,"This course will give students the opportunity to develop a research proposal and prepare for anthropological fieldwork, regardless of subfield. The class will meet for three weeks at the beginning of the semester and two weeks following Spring Break. The first section will focus on developing a research proposal, seeking approval from the Institutional Review Board, and submitting the proposal for funding. The second part will concentrate on logistical preparation for the field and examining fieldwork ethics and expectations. Students should begin the course with a concrete idea for a research project that they develop in consultation with their advisor."

ANTH 40890,"Our species is unique because it is the only species that deliberately buries its dead.  Mortuary analysis (the study of burial patterns) is a powerful approach that archaeologists use for the study of prehistoric social organization and ideology.  This course explores the significance of prehistoric human mortuary behavior, from the first evidence of deliberate burial by Neanderthals as an indicator of the evolution of symbolic thought, to the analysis of the sometimes spectacular burial patterns found in complex societies such as ancient Egypt and Megalithic Europe.  We will also examine the theoretical and practical aspects of the archaeology of death, including the applications of various techniques ranging from statistics to ethnography, and the legal and ethical issues associated with the excavation and scientific study of human remains."

ANTH 41840,"This course is a hands-on opportunity to work with a team on an ongoing digital project -- School Stories, or Schoop-- about people's experiences of being in school, and to amplify the work via social media.  SchoolStories is a crowdsourcing project, seeking stories in various formats, including text, still images, audio, and video. The research team aims to curate a professional, powerful website and to solicit interest from both viewers and contributors, via social media.  The goal of the project is to collect and disseminate personal experiences of people (especially students and teachers) involved in schools at all levels, and internationally. Experience-near accounts of school should always be considered by policy makers and those charged with designing schools, but they are often overlooked in favor of simpler standardized measures. These experiences are affective, bodily, social, economic, medical, and more, not just cognitive--so we need different methods to learn about them.  The course will meet for an hour weekly, and students will be expected to spend another 1-2 hours weekly working on the project, helping to design the weekly or monthly props, to promote interest, and to analyze the results."

ANTH 50405,"Why is talking about climate change without reference to colonial pasts an incomplete conversation? Why is a forward-looking climate justice conversation incomplete unless it is also looking back? How does coloniality present today? How does the global south figure in writing on climate change? Can there be a role for the global south in the climate justice conversation that recognizes its vulnerability to climate change but goes beyond portraying it as always and only vulnerable, devastated and/or menacing? In this class we will begin with the premise that the answer is yes: not only is such a role possible, but it must actively be created if the climate justice conversation is to an inclusive one. Examining representations of climate refugees, extreme weather events, and imagined geographies of conflicts, and informed by scholarship on racialized constructions of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ migrants, in this class we will collectively work through the intersections between the political and ecological that today determine the movement of humans, capital, and knowledge. Our collective endeavor will be to: (i) understand writing on climate change with a focus on its implicit (yet predominant) threat and risk imaginaries; (ii) question the role of the global south in such writing; and (iii) craft a lexicon that is cognizant of colonial pasts and their continuity, and relates geographies, histories and politics in more equal ways."

ANTH 60200,"What is psychic life? The word psyche has encompassed a range of definitions as it has travelled through time, from notions of mind, soul, spirit, and the conscious and unconscious mind, to a mirror, an asteroid discovered in 1852, a moth or butterfly, and anima mundi, the animating principle of the universe itself. Today an additional constellation of concepts may also be drawn into psyche's orbit, including brain, emotion, feeling, affect, self, subjectivity, person, ego, and experience. As opposed to terms like mental health, the concept of psychic life provides a language with which to speak about a range of phenomena across multiple traditions, epistemologies, and histories, without prioritizing any one conceptualization over another or locating the psyche within the boundaries of an individual mind, as distinct from the body and the world. Instead, in this course we will explore psychic life through the various ways in which it is known-as lived-experience; cultural, historical, and political form; object of intervention; and site of experimentation.   The approaches engaged in this course draw from psychological anthropology, ethnopsychology, critical global health, history of medicine, cultural studies, affect theory, psychoanalysis, and critical phenomenology with an overarching dedication to de-stigmatizing mental illness, and embracing neurodiversity in all its forms. Along the way we will cover topics including madness and reason, psychopolitics, global mental health, the governance of the self, the psychic life of racism, radical mental health collectives and the psychedelic renaissance, as well as a set of phenomena that lie at the limits of experience, such as psychosomatization, solitary confinement, oceanic feeling, and dreaming."
ANTH 60201,"This course will review, engage and analyze major themes, perspectives, and methodologies in biological anthropology and illustrate their connectivity and integration into a broader anthropological approach.  The seminar will contain a heavy reading load of historical and current theoretical and practical applications of evolutionary, ecological, physiological, endocrinological, molecular and morphological approaches in the study of humans and other primates, past and present."
ANTH 60204,"This course orients you to the theory and practice of anthropological inquiry focused on the constitution of subjects through language use. To what ends do social beings engage in communication and what are obligatory properties of its organization? The seminar examines how language and cultural structure and change afford sometimes opposing limitations and possibilities for linguistically mediated life. We explore the dialectic between creative agency and semiotic systems as material fields in the collective fashioning of meaning and difference through speech, ritual, mass media, and verbal art. You are expected to incorporate concepts from the course into your own planned doctoral work and to explore integrative bridges between anthropological subdisciplines."
ANTH 60313,"This course provides grounding in some of the methods of qualitative analysis present in the field of anthropology. The focus of the course is on developing skills that students can use to do systematic analysis of anthropological data. The perspective guiding the course is that anthropology is an empirical, scientific approach for describing social and cultural aspects of human life, and that qualitative data can be analyzed in systematic and rigorous ways. The course will explore a range of approaches and will cover analytic skills that cut across traditions, including theme identification, code definition, and pattern recognition. Advanced topics covered will include content analysis, text analysis, and schema analysis. Students will learn techniques and protocols in data arrangement and visualization that are appropriate for different analytical methods. It is a hands-on class where students will be able to work on data provided to them as well as on their own. Collaboration will be integral to the course success."
ANTH 60700,"This course will give students the opportunity to develop a research proposal and prepare for anthropological fieldwork, regardless of subfield.

The second part will concentrate on logistical preparation for the field and examining fieldwork ethics and expectations. Students should begin the course with a concrete idea for a research project that they develop in consultation with their advisor."
ANTH 60801,"Almost 40% of the world's population is overweight or has obesity. Obesity has become a central focus in biological research as well as policy. Billions of dollars have been spent on public health interventions, biological interventions, diets, and exercise regimens. However, the obesity rate among adults and children has been steadily increasing globally. Why is this happening? How do we even define obesity? Does that definition truly reflect health? Why do we even have fat to begin with...actually what even is fat?!? Why are humans prone to obesity? These are just some of the questions we will address in this class. Using non-traditional methods and assignments, we will discuss adipose tissue and digestive physiology, the role evolution has played in the human propensity to hold onto fat, diet and exercise, food insecurity, therapeutic interventions, as well as the physical and mental health consequences of having obesity. We will use this as a basis to investigate the biological and cultural factors including stigma, race, and gender that shape our perceptions of body image and health in the midst of the obesity epidemic. Finally, this course will include occasional laboratory exercises to familiarize you with the methods used to assess body mass, body composition, metabolic rate, and point of care measures of biomarkers like glucose and cholesterol."
ANTH 60890,"Our species is unique because it is the only species that deliberately buries its dead. Mortuary analysis (the study of burial patterns) is a powerful approach that archaeologists use for the study of prehistoric social organization and ideology. This course explores the significance of prehistoric human mortuary behavior, from the first evidence of deliberate burial by Neanderthals as an indicator of the evolution of symbolic thought, to the analysis of the sometimes spectacular burial patterns found in complex societies such as ancient Egypt and Megalithic Europe. We will also examine the theoretical and practical aspects of the archaeology of death, including the applications of various techniques ranging from statistics to ethnography, and the legal and ethical issues associated with the excavation and scientific study of human remains."
ANTH 63100,"This is a lab-intensive course that explores the methods used in physical anthropology for studying individual human skeletal remains, as well as those employed to establish biocultural connections at the population level. Forensic techniques utilized in individual identification will be developed in the first third of the course."
ANTH 63201,"Organized violence between human communities is one of the unfortunate realities of human existence, and its causes and consequences have consequently been of great interest. Is war an inevitable outcome of human nature, or the result of specific social, historical, and environmental circumstances? Archaeology is uniquely positioned to provide concrete insights into the history of human violence through study of its direct material correlates?traumatic injuries on skeletons, fortified settlements, weaponry, and iconography. However, the archaeological record also documents the impacts of violence?reduced nutritional status and health, evidence for enslavement, cannibalism, and population decline?and can provide insights into why war occurred through examination of environment, population, and social conditions. In this course, we will explore what the archaeological record tells us about violence, human nature, and the veracity of claims for either a more violent or more peaceful past. We will examine theoretical models of war, anthropological studies of conflict, and archaeological case studies of both violent and peaceful times to understand the role that organized violence has played in human history and evolution."
ANTH 63210,"Have you ever pondered how people live(d) in a world without television, YouTube, iPhones, Lady GaGa, and cellphones? Why have bellbottoms come and gone twice in the last 50 years? Will we be forced to relive the fashion mistakes of the 1980s? What new stuff will people invent and sell next? In asking and answering these questions, we must focus on one underlying query: What does our stuff really say about who we are and who we want to be? This course combines lectures, discussions, and interactive small group activities to explore the nature and breadth of peoples' relationships with their things. We will investigate why and how people make and use different types of objects, and how the use of these material goods resonates with peoples' identities in the deep past, recent history, and today. Since everyone in the class will already be an expert user and consumer of things, we will consider how people today use material objects to assert, remake, reclaim, and create identities, and compare today's practices to those of people who lived long ago. Class members will learn about how anthropologists, including ethnographers (studying people today) and archaeologists (studying past peoples) think about and approach the material nature of our social, economic, and political lives. We will discuss why styles and technologies change through time, and why, in the end, there is very little new under the sun in terms of human behaviors and the way people produce and consume goods. The topical breadth of this workshop encompasses most social science disciplines, including history, economics, psychology, and anthropology, and resonates with classics, art history, and gender studies."
ANTH 63316,"Together with the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean have been among the most influential exporters of music globally since the early 20th century. This course traces these processes of musical production and consumption. Students will be introduced to important historical and stylistic musical developments as we survey various styles and genres with attention to their cultural significance - including the corrido (Mexican ballad), Caribbean-derived salsa, and cumbia, among others. Our approach, such that we are dealing with music-cultures, is at once anthropological and ethnomusicological. In order we achieve our aims, the course is organized along two axes: one chronological (so to speak), the other conceptual, neither complete. The chronological portion will allow us to survey various genres and ensembles of musical production. We dovetail this effort with a focus on important themes and concepts that aid in understanding the present and historical conditions of the terrain where performance, identity, race-ethnicity, gender, transnationalism, and commoditized publics intersect."

ARCH 60311,"The course serves as a broad survey of the theoretical underpinnings, essential themes and history of new classical and traditional architecture and urbanism.  It is organized in three five-week modules, each taught by different faculty members.   The first module begins with definitions, focusing on the nature of the traditional city, building typology, and traditional architectural expressions, which range from ordinary building assemblages (vernacular) to an intellectualized, poetic vocabulary of forms rooted in straight-forward construction (classical).  It continues with a description of the contemporary crisis that has resulted from the abandonment of normative urban, typological and formal strategies, and a critique of modern attitudes toward the making of buildings and cities. It is followed by a discussion of the resurgence of classical / traditional architecture and urbanism, and concludes with a summary of traditional analytical and compositional strategies.  The second module opens with a discussion of the nature of humanist culture and urbanism and its grounding, by way of Platonic and Aristotelian thought, in the Catholic intellectual tradition.  It continues with a description of traditional urban formal order from spatial, anthropological and typological points of view.  The third module focuses on a number of themes, beginning with the intellectual history of Modern Traditional Architecture, that is, the reasons that led an international group of architects to cohere a comprehensive reform of architectural practice and education. This reform addressed ecological, urban, architectural matters side by side with a host of cultural productions (e.g. artistic theory, philosophy of history) that frame the intellectual milieu in which architecture is justified. The third module continues to clarify some vital, yet sometimes misunderstood, concepts such as the nature of Modernity and that of Modernism; architectural types, characters and styles; the nature of artistic imitation and invention; and the idea of technique and the distinction between techne and tectonics."

ASIA 13105,"This course is taught jointly by a group of Asia experts from different departments of the University. It provides students with a unique introduction to Asia in all its diversity, ranging from its languages, cultures, and histories to its political and economic systems and its relations with the US. As the global balance of power is shifting towards Asia, it is more important than ever for Notre Dame students to have more than just basic knowledge about the continent. This course provides just that: an opportunity to take your understanding of Asia beyond the level of what you read in the newspapers, providing you with the tools to formulate your own critical understanding of the region and its global environment.  Classroom sessions will be structured around a set of common assumptions about Asia as a whole or about specific Asian countries. Through reading, discussion, and lectures by members of the teaching team, students will be encouraged to reflect critically on those assumptions and consider a range of alternative interpretations. As much as possible, professors will assign some of their own work as readings for the course and introduce their own perspectives as gained from their research practice. For their writing assignments, students will be asked to make connections between the topics of different lectures and, as much as possible, to think comparatively about different parts of Asia."

ASIA 20203,"This course introduces students to the field of social-cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropologists are primarily interested in exploring issues of human cultural diversity across cultures and through time. This course will explore key theoretical, topical, and ethical issues of interest to cultural anthropologists. We will examine diverse ways in which people around the globe have constructed social organizations (such as kinship, and political and economic systems) and cultural identities (such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, race, and class) and we will consider the impact of increasing globalization on such processes. Throughout the course we will consider how different anthropologists go about their work as they engage in research and as they represent others through the writing of ethnographies. "
ASIA 20451,"Scholars have long speculated about the rise of Asia, but Asia has already risen. Asian economies are driving global growth; Asian governments are some of the largest purveyors of foreign aid and investment; and Asian superpowers like China are shaping and shifting geopolitics. This course, taught by a political scientist and a historian, offers students the opportunity to unpack the complexity and diversity of Asia across time and space. We will explore Asia through political and historical concepts against the background of China's evolving role within the region. At the same time, we will focus on elevating diverse Asian voices to understand how historical concepts and political and economic trajectories have shifted over time and what it means for domestic and global audiences in the 21st century.  As an integration course, our focus is analytical and interdisciplinary: we examine the political, economic, and social trajectory of Asia to shed light on the most dynamic region of the world. We also devote considerable time to understanding how historical legacies and patterns such as  colonialism or economic imperialism impact Asia today. Lectures, assigned readings covering a wide range of primary and secondary sources in political science and history, and a discussion-oriented format introduces students to issues ranging from populism, party-state capitalism, and poverty alleviation to soft and sharp power, demographic crises, surveillance, and social unrest. All majors and backgrounds are welcome. No prior knowledge of Asian languages or topics is required."
ASIA 20600,"Understanding religious communities and their values are crucial to understanding human societies and global affairs. One particular group of interpreters of Islam, namely the traditional or orthodox religious scholars called the ulama and their institutions, are often hidden from contemporary accounts of Islam when in fact they are critical players. This course will provide historical contexts in order to explore how traditional Muslims navigate the discourses of modernity and how they resist it. We will read original texts in translation and secondary sources of descriptions of representatives of the orthodox tradition in regions of Asia, the Middle East and in the West. The course will pay particular attention to the institutions of learning known as madrasas, jami` and hawzas. Of course, the orthodox views are challenged by other Muslims and some of those debates will also be channeled in the class while the focus will remain on the Ulama. The course aims to equip students with analytical skills and the resources to understand how religious ideas impact religious communities and global affairs."
ASIA 30056,"This course will provide advanced undergraduates and graduate students with a critical introduction to digital humanities for the study of early China, the fountainhead of Chinese Civilization. Collaborating with the Center of Digital Scholarship, this course will focus on relational data with structured information on historical figures, especially high officials, of early Chinese empires. Throughout the semester, we will read academic articles, mine data from primary sources, and employ Gephi and ArcGIS to visualize data. Those constructed data will cover three major themes: how geographical mobility contributed to consolidating a newly unified empire over diversified regions; how social networks served as the hidden social structure channeling the flow of power and talents; and how criminal records and excavated legal statutes shed light on the unique understanding of law and its relationship with the state in Chinese history."
ASIA 30101,"This lecture and discussion course on the religion, philosophy, and intellectual history of China that introduces the student to the world view and life experience of Chinese as they have been drawn from local traditions, as well as worship and sacrifice to heroes, and the cult of the dead. Through a close reading of primary texts in translation, it also surveys China's grand philosophical legacy of Daoism, Buddhism, Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism, and the later religious accommodation of Christianity and Islam. "
ASIA 30112,"This course provides students with a critical understanding of how South Korean society is organized, the major social issues that have dominated the contemporary era, and how systems of social inequality have changed since the postwar period. We will analyze in particular, three major periods of social change, including 1) the democratization movement of the 1970s and 1980s, 2) the Asian financial crisis and its impact on social inequality and poverty, and finally, 3) South Korea’s aging crisis and its implications for the future. No prior knowledge of Asian languages or topics is required."
ASIA 30117,"This class will survey the various historical and contemporary dimensions of Asian American experiences including immigration and integration, family and community dynamics, ethnic/gender/class identity, as well as transnational and diasporic experiences. We will explore contemporary and historical issues of racism, the model minority myth, inter-generational relationships, and the educational experiences of Asian Americans. To accomplish this, our class will pose such questions as: Who is Asian American? How did racism create Chinatown? Is there an Asian advantage? Coursework includes essays based on topics of your choice, presentations, and a creative narrative."
ASIA 30171,"It is tempting to think that South Asia - home to nearly two billion people - is only now beginning to occupy global attention. But India has played a prominent part in global history for centuries. This course will span three millennia - from the Indus Valley civilization, to the time of Buddha, to the powerful Mughal Empire, two centuries of the British rule, the Gandhi-led freedom struggle, and ending with the recent histories of independent India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This introduction to India and South Asia will answer questions such as: Has there been an unbroken Indian civilization? How did a British company come to rule a vast Indian empire? How did India win its independence? What accounts for the region's poverty? Why are India and Pakistan separate countries today, with such divergent trajectories of democracy and dictatorship? And, finally, could India rival China and the United States in this century? South Asia is a place of extreme diversity and paradox: it can be confusing. However, its history offers us explanations. This course will offer an introduction and guide to the history of India's rich history, stormy politics, vibrant cultures, and globalized economies."
ASIA 30200,"This course examines the late 20th and early 21st century economic miracles of several East Asian countries and the political, social, and spatial factors underpinning them. We will explore similarities, differences, and interdependencies in the development trajectories of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and mainland China, and will debate how accurate and useful concepts like the developmental state and state capitalism are in describing the political economy of the region. To what extent has China's economic rise followed the existing playbooks of its East Asian neighbors? What human costs and developmental distortions have accompanied booming industrial and urban growth? And what lessons does East Asia's experience offer for the contemporary developing world?"
ASIA 30309,"How has the Internet changed the ways people voice their opinions, gather information, and organize social movements? Have marginalized groups become more empowered by mobilizing online? Why does increased social media activity often exacerbate political polarization and populism? How has social media affected national elections? This course will analyze these questions and more within the context of East Asia. In analyzing the impact of the Internet on state-society relations, students will analyze state attempts to control media consumption and surveil Internet-use in Communist regimes like North Korea and China. We will compare these trends with similar efforts made by state actors in advanced industrialized countries such as Japan and South Korea. While the Internet-usage is in many ways, still tightly regulated by the state, the Web has in many ways, also empowered people formerly detached from politics to become politically engaged. This has led to both political polarization (and the influx of political extremist groups), as well as large-scale grassroots movements for democratization. Along these lines, we will examine the growth of far-right netizen groups in Japan, South Korea, and China and the subsequent proliferation of hate crimes, populism, and ultra-nationalism. We will also read studies of how teenagers used their presence on social media and the blogosphere to eventually lead large-scaled national protests like the 2016 Candlelight Movement in Seoul and the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. Finally, in studying the global diffusion of social protests in the digital age, we will analyze how the #MeToo movement reignited new waves of feminism in South Korea, Japan, and China. What implications does the Internet have for the future democracy?"
ASIA 30330,"This course offers an in-depth examination of one of the world's most popular media: Japanese animation. Students will study the development of the anime industry and the artistic styles used in anime with an eye toward understanding how this supposedly unique form of art in fact responds to and affects global events and art forms. Students will learn to not only passively watch, but actively see how an anime fits into global currents."
ASIA 30404,"This course introduces Chinese popular culture through the lens of contemporary Chinese cultural phenomena, including food culture, popular music, documentary films, martial arts movies, copycat culture, youth culture, and social media. It will be organized thematically. The lectures will introduce the major themes, including gender issues, social justice, government censorship, subcultures, family and state, localization and globalization, in a broad form and employ examples and case studies to provide students with a better understanding of actual Chinese society as it exists today. We will investigate the historical, sociopolitical, and aesthetical roots and impacts of the cultural phenomena. All readings are in English, no prior knowledge of Chinese language or culture is required."
ASIA 30409,"This course examines the most important bilateral relationship in the world today. It begins with an overview of the major historic episodes in U.S.-China relations, then, adopting a theme-based approach, it examines the relationship among important topics in the contemporary bilateral relationship across the overlapping political, economic and security spheres. The course will stress the importance of perceptions in policymaking, and use student presentations and a crisis simulation to allow students to understand the problem from various perspectives."

Students will acquire a basic knowledge of Japanese geography, historical periods, changing class structure and political organization. The main emphasis, however, is on the development of the fine arts, such as painting, architecture, gardens, and sculpture. The course also introduces students to the important and continuous influence of Chinese art, literature, Buddhism and Confucianism. Through readings of selected literary works (prose fiction, poetry, essays on aesthetics), students will learn how shared aesthetic values changed over time in relation to their social and political context.

ASIA 30604,"This course examines US engagement in hotspots across the Muslim world before and after 9/11. In particular focus are nations in South Asia and the Middle East: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq. We will also look at US relations with important Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, as well as policies toward Israel-Palestine and the Bosnian War in Europe. US engagement abroad takes many forms, including public diplomacy, trade, sanctions, alliances, covert operations, financial and military aid, and direct military intervention. What are the drivers of American decision-making in the region? Why is there so much anti-American sentiment in Muslim societies? Does peace depend on a critical reassessment of US foreign policy or the reform of a radical Islamist theology? Do certain interpretations of religion make conflict inevitable, or is it possible to attain reasonable outcomes even when dealing with extremists? Through a blend of history, investigative journalism, case studies, opinion polls, literature, and film, this course broadens our perspectives on some of America's longest wars in the Muslim world."

ASIA 40748,"This course looks at the totality of the China-Africa relationship historically, currently and into the future. The course will give special attention to the politics, economics and security interests of China in Africa's 54 countries. It will examine the methods and objectives China has employed in Africa, African countries' response to China, and the perceptions of both sides. At the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the development and current state of China-Africa relations, where China excels and where it faces major challenges. Students will also learn how China interacts with African regional and sub-regional organizations and other emerging non-African powers on the continent. Finally, they should have some understanding of the implications of China in Africa for the United States and the West generally. Topics in the overlapping political, economic and security spheres will be examined. Questions investigated include: How do Chinese policymakers see Africa and its place in China's foreign policy? What are Chinese objectives in Africa? What methods does China use to achieve its objectives in Africa? Why and how do China's foreign policies differ from country to country? How have African countries responded to China's expanded economic and political presence on the continent? How have domestic political and economic changes in China and in African countries helped shape its relations with African countries? How have African countries sought to achieve their objectives vis-a-vis China and how successful have they been? The deliverables for this class are two written policy briefs, an oral presentation, and class participation. In addition to improving students' knowledge of China-Africa relations, this course also seeks to help them improve their ability to convey information to an informed audience as well as their ability to obtain and process the information conveyed by others."
ASIA 43500,"This course offers a comparative perspective on law and legal institutions. Looking comparatively helps shed light on our own system and question what is normal or natural. From what it means to be a lawyer to notions of what is just or fair, courts and dispute resolution outside the U.S. can be both very different and, at times, surprisingly familiar. After an overview of concepts and classic approaches to the study of law and society, the course will explore these differences and similarities in three Asian settings: China, Japan, and India. Topics include courts and the legal profession, crime, inequality, and environmental protection, to see how each country's history, political structure, values, and interests shape how legal issues are defined and play out."

BES 33100,"This is a Catholicism and the Disciplines (CAD) course that can fulfill a core curriculum requirement, or can be taken as an elective. Work has long been a subject of Catholic thought, with the first chapter of Genesis regarded as the first gospel of work (Laborem Exercens, para. 25). This course focuses on the interior spiritual aspects of work, and does so via the Catholic intellectual and social traditions. A person's interior spiritual life, or interior life for short, has been described as the intimate conversation that the person carries on with God during the daily moments and seasons of life. When it comes to the subject of work, the interior life involves one's internal disposition toward his or her work, how one understands his or her work, and one's intentions for work. The Church's proposition is that all have the ability to envelope their work in the interior life.

BES 40470,"In this course, we will critically consider, in light of Catholic Social Teaching, three normative questions regarding the purpose, priorities, and practices of corporations. First, what does the dignity of the human person, as made in the image and likeness of God, mean for people working in business? Second, what do businesses owe to their own workers and the society writ-large, and how do we foster solidarity among those working in business? Third, how can businesses promote authentic human flourishing and integral human development? To answer these questions, we explore certain foundational concepts of Catholic Social Teaching - the dignity of the human person, solidarity and subsidiarity, the virtues of charity and justice, and the common good - and ask how these concepts can be integrated into business practices and corporate governance.

BES 60400,"What is the role of business in a just and humane society? Many of you are about to dedicate your lives to business, and the rest of you will work, in one way or another, with business. Yet many people believe that business is a morally suspicious activity, a suspicion evident in the common belief that business people need to give back to society. Is business an activity for which one must atone? Are people right to be suspicious of business? This course is designed to engage ideas from the Catholic tradition with perspectives drawn from moral philosophy, business, and economics. We will engage issues of faith and normativity both critically and constructively. Students will consider competing positions on faith and normative questions, will reflect on (or discover elements of) their own faith or non-faith, and will describe the extent to which they believe various claims are supported by faith or reason. This course responds to Pope John Paul II's Centesimus Annus (1991) and Pope Francis's Laudato Si (2015), which called on Catholic education to safeguard the moral conditions for an authentic 'human ecology' (Centesimus Annus, 38)."

It begins by tracing the development of modern evolutionary theory and the place of evolutionary studies in anthropology, especially in the sub-field of bioanthropology. These concepts provide the framework for understanding the many lines of evidence that anthropologists use to explore and explain human evolution. These include studies of our primate relatives, through the intricacies of the fossil record, to archaeological evidence for the invention of material culture from the simplest stone tools to the complex cultural world that we live in today. Modern human variation can only be explained as the result of evolutionary forces acting on the complex interplay of biology and culture over millions of years.

This course focuses on Notre Dame football history as an entry point into larger questions about the cultural, historical, and social significance of football in the U.S. Who has been allowed to play on what terms? How have events from Notre Dame football's past been remembered and re-imagined? How has success in Notre Dame football been defined and redefined? In particular, the course will focus on how Notre Dame football became a touchstone for Catholic communities and institutions across the country navigating the fraught terrain of immigration, whiteness, and religious practice. This course will take up those questions through significant engagement with University Archive collections related to Notre Dame football, working with digitized materials to think about questions relating to access and discovery of physical and electronic collections. This course will include hands-on work with metadata, encoding and markup, digitization, and digital preservation/access through a collaboration with the University Archives and the Navari Family Center for Digital Scholarship. Readings for this course will include chapters from texts such as Murray Sperber's Shake Down the Thunder: The Creation of Notre Dame Football (1993), TriStar Pictures' Rudy (1993), Steve Delsohn's Talking Irish: The Oral History of Notre Dame Football (2001), Jerry Barca's Unbeatable: Notre Dame's 1988 Championship and the Last Great College Football Season (2014), David Roediger's Working Toward Whiteness: How America's Immigrants Became White (2005), David Roediger's The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class (1991), and Noel Ignatiev's How the Irish Became White (1995).

CHR 20228,"Many have claimed that the American educational system is the great equalizer. In other words, the educational system gives everyone a chance to prosper in American society regardless of their social origins. In this course, we will explore the validity of this claim. We will consider questions such as: 1) Does our educational system promote social mobility or social reproduction? 2) How has the relationship between race/ethnicity and educational performance changed in the last few decades? 3) How do social class and gender shape the kinds of educational experiences students have? 4) How does educational policy influence the kinds of experiences kids have in school? Can policy reduce inequality?"
CHR 30708,"What role does international law have in the advancement of human rights, and how does human rights, in turn, advance international law? This course introduces university students to the general system of modern international law (e.g. its norm-generating framework involving States and non-State actors; the roles of many State and non-State authoritative decision-makers in shaping expectations of peaceful, just, and responsible behavior in the international system; its varied constellation of dispute settlement courts and tribunals, alongside the prospects and limits of enforcing State compliance with international decisions), specifically viewed from the lens of historic global, regional, and domestic challenges to human dignity that influenced the first global codification of human rights norms under the United Nations' 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, up to the present development of the current international system of protection for human rights. The course situates the framework of modern international law and civil, political, economic, social, and cultural human rights, using five examples of the historic, defining, and 'constitutionalizing moments' for the international system: 1) the international abolition of slavery; 2) the evolution from classical to modern international law in dismantling colonial empires to enshrine the self-determination of all peoples and the equality of sovereignty of all nations; 3) the outlawing of the aggressive use of force since 1929, towards the peaceful settlement of maritime and territorial disputes and the humanitarian rules applicable to armed conflict situations; 4) the establishment of international accountability of individuals and States for genocide, crimes against humanity and other human rights atrocities; and 5) the global regulation for sustainable use, shared protection, and intergenerational responsibility over natural resources (land, oceans, atmosphere, outer space)."
CHR 30709,"We are living through a watershed moment in United States history. Structural racism is at the forefront of the national discourse. Yet, the threat that racism holds on our nation's most cherished ideals of democracy and justice is hardly new. Generations of activists, scholars, and everyday people have fought and persevered to bring about social, cultural, and policy change.     This course engages deeply with topics relevant to the national discourse on racial and ethnic relations in the U.S. The first part of the course examines key concepts, focusing on the social construction of race and ethnicity, prejudice, and discrimination. The second part reviews the historical experiences of Native Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans. The third and final part of the course centers on four critical issues that are especially relevant in 2020: (1) immigration; (2) political disenfranchisement; (3) racial and ethnic disparities in health; and (4) racism in the criminal justice system."
CHR 30711,"In June 2020, prompted by the horrific killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, our nation awakened to the brutality of institutional racism and the violence to human dignity it has wrought in communities of color throughout America's history.  The movement for racial justice was renewed in vigor with nationwide protests and calls for action.  Although the protests of 2020 have largely been a response to a crisis surrounding police violence, the calls to action have focused attention on the breadth of systemic racism in all facets of American life. In this course, students will engage weekly with a single event or concept, drawn from a variety of disciplines, necessary to understand and dismantle systemic racism.  The course centers around a weekly guest-lecture series featuring authors, public intellectuals, faith leaders, and external and internal members of the academy.  In each class period, the guest expert provides a sophisticated introduction to a discrete racial justice topic.  Some lectures address historical events not widely known (e.g., the Tulsa massacre or the arrival of the first slave ship in the Americas in 1619); others address current racial inequities (e.g., the wealth gap, health outcomes, criminal justice, voter suppression); still others examine broad concepts (e.g., intersectionality, Catholic teaching on racism).  Specific topics to be determined by expert availability.  Students prepare for the sessions by researching the speaker or topic and preparing thoughtful questions to be posed during the guest's visit.  Students also participate in at least two small group discussions and, at the conclusion of the semester, are required to produce a short reflective writing piece.  The entire course will be offered via zoom for all participants."
CHR 30717,"While there is a wealth of academic work on race, racism, and anti-racism in the domestic realm, there is less attention to them in the international context. This is unfortunate, because they cannot be domestically confined. United Nations resolutions against racism, debates about whether the International Criminal Court is racially biased, and the global wave of anti-racist protests in 2020 are a few examples. This course examines race in the international context, exploring how it affects, is affected by, and is intertwined with central topics in international relations, including human rights, war and peace, foreign policy, international law and international organizations. "
CHR 30718,"This seminar will provide an overview of and  framework to understand the global refugee crisis. We will trace the evolution of international refugee law and policy dealing with this ever-growing population. Central are the ethical challenges that refugees pose for the international community. What is the nature of our collective obligation to refugees? What determines the extent of this obligation? Through a series of legal and sociological case studies, students will also grapple with the social, legal , political and ethical challenges posed by humanitarian intervention on behalf of refugees and the often unintended consequences of such policies.

This project-based course will pair students with a refugee community to address a pressing social concern."
CHR 30730,"This course will devote the first part of the semester to establishing an account of the historical roots of the current affordable housing crisis in the United States, paying particular attention to the local Michiana context. It will also introduce students to the housing “continuum of care” in the City of South Bend, noting the various institutional and governmental agencies currently involved in addressing housing needs as well as the gaps in coverage, e.g. the need for a permanent low-barrier intake center.   The second part of the course will involve community engagement as students begin to pursue specific research projects. Students will have the opportunity to network with area housing agencies and local government entities and research best practices in other urban areas. During this segment of the course, students will engage with experts in the field, both virtually and in person.  This work will lead into their own constructive proposals for a concrete contribution to meeting the current low-income and supportive housing needs locally, regionally, and/or nationally.  All these signs of the times will be held in conversation with Catholic social teaching, exploring  the concept of housing as a human right and duty in service of the common good."
CHR 30731,"Disability has long been constructed as the opposite of higher education. Universities are places that valorize, even demand, physical and intellectual ability. Disability, in turn, is often seen as something that does not fit within a university context, a problem that must be fixed. This antithetical relationship between disability and the university is rooted in history—eugenical curriculums, research programs that study disabled people—but it continues today. Despite a growing focus on diversity in university admissions and populations, disabled students enter higher education at a lower rate than non-disabled students and are less likely to graduate. In addition, universities perpetuate cultures of ableism in both faculty and students by prioritizing ability, perfection, and achievement. This course interrogates the relationship between disability and higher education with a special focus on our university, Notre Dame. Students will be introduced to fundamental principles in disability studies; explore the place of disability in higher education; and, drawing on scholarship in critical university studies, consider intersections between ableism, racism, and sexism in university contexts. Students will also think and learn about what inclusive and accessible education might look like. The course will conclude with a student-driven project designed to increase access, inclusiveness, and awareness about ableism and disability at Notre Dame."
CHR 30732,"Food access, equity and justice should be of great importance to everyone. Consistently there has been political, economic, geographic and flawed distribution supply chains within the domestic food system. This interdisciplinary course will utilize digital humanities tools and platforms for students to express their research interests. We will analyze the impact that human actions have on foodways, or the social, cultural, and economic practices of producing and consuming food in relation to race, equity and access, historically and currently. We will explore alternative courses of action toward viable, ethical, and antiracist solutions to questions about sustainable farming, global economic inequality, and hunger. Throughout the semester, participants will use the lens of race and ethnicity to study and discuss how these two concepts affect access to agricultural land, foodstuffs/foodways, environmental justice and nature."
CHR 30733,"In 2023, it is difficult to avoid the language of antiracism, and harder still to discern its politics. Is racism a matter of structure or intention? Culture or economics? What does racial justice look like? And what exactly are those structures anyways? Moving from the civil rights movement of the 1960s to the George Floyd Uprisings of 2020, this course introduces students to the history behind a freighted term. We will read classic and contemporary texts of antiracism, tracking how American activists, politicians, artists, and scholars wrestled with these questions in the twilight years of the welfare state, mass industry, and securely waged employment. "
CHR 33702,"In June 2020, prompted by the horrific killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, our nation awakened to the brutality of institutional racism and the violence to human dignity it has wrought in communities of color throughout America's history.  The movement for racial justice was renewed in vigor with nationwide protests and calls for action.  Although the protests of 2020 have largely been a response to a crisis surrounding police violence, the calls to action have focused attention on the breadth of systemic racism in all facets of American life. In this course, students will engage weekly with a single event or concept, drawn from a variety of disciplines, necessary to understand and dismantle systemic racism.  The course centers around a weekly guest-lecture series featuring authors, public intellectuals, faith leaders, and external and internal members of the academy.  In each guest-lecture class period, the guest expert provides a sophisticated introduction to a discrete racial justice topic.  Some lectures address historical events not widely known (e.g., the Tulsa massacre or the arrival of the first slave ship in the Americas in 1619); others address current racial inequities (e.g., the wealth gap, health outcomes, criminal justice, voter suppression); still others examine broad concepts (e.g., intersectionality, Catholic teaching on racism).  Specific topics to be determined by expert availability.  This three-credit version of the course is designed for students who are interested in a more intensive study of each week's topic.  Students will participate in once-weekly in-person seminar sessions with readings to accompany the speaker and topic for the week.  Following each guest lecture, students will gather briefly via zoom to reflect and respond.  Throughout the course of the semester, students will compose a variety of short papers, lead classroom discussions, and complete a final project incorporating independent research on related topics."

CLAS 20202,"We will use ancient sources, material evidence and modern scholarship to attempt and reconstruct the first seven centuries of Roman history, broadly speaking, from the foundation of Rome (and the murder of Remus) to the murder of Julius Caesar and the civil war. Throughout the course, we will ask two main questions: how did the Romans manage to transform their small town into a world power in a few centuries? That is, why did the Romans, and not any other people, manage to conquer and unify the entire Mediterranean? Secondly, we will discuss the political, social and cultural consequences of this transformation. These questions exercised the Romans themselves, and some of the responses they gave will be considered in light of current scholarship. Within a broad chronological framework, we will also discuss aspects of daily life in ancient Rome: what was life like for normal people, including women and slaves, in the Roman Republic? And how was the majority of the people affected by historical change?"
CLAS 20350,"Do you feel restless? Are you searching for an answer to the meaning of your life? The ancient Greeks and Romans asked themselves questions like these all the time. Their desire for happiness led to the creation of many heroes and heroines, from the warlike Achilles to the cunning Odysseus, and from the witch Medea to the pious Aeneas who rejects the love of the beautiful Dido. All of them had a relatively quiet life until the point that they chose to give up their comforts and reject their complacency: from that moment they became heroines and heroes, since, as Joseph Campbell argued, a hero or a heroine is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself. Most of these characters are still famous today. For instance, when George Lucas started the Star Wars Trilogies, he decided to model Luke Skywalker on the life of the ancient heroes Odysseus and Aeneas. In this class, ancient texts and recent movies will introduce us to the lives of these ancient heroes and heroines, from Achilles to Captain America and Wonder Woman. By studying these special characters we will come to understand their ideals and ambitions, and compare them to our own ideals and ambitions. Are you more fascinated by Achilles' desire for immortal glory on the battlefield, or by Aeneas' decision to obey to the will of the gods, regardless of the sacrifice that this implies? This class will raise this and similar questions. Moreover, in their struggle for fulfillment, some of these heroes, like Jason, did not reach the glory they wanted: by reading about their spectacular defeats, we will also reflect on the challenge of suffering our failures and learning from them. Finally, in the last third of the class, we will compare these heroes and heroines with contemporary heroes, namely Western heroes, Star Wars Heroes and Heroines, and a selection of the Avengers. For example, Iron Man's fight against Obadiah Stane will be taken as a contemporary re-enactment of the competition between Odysseus' cunning and Achilles' physical violence. As the Austrian psychoanalyst Otto Rank once said, everyone is a hero or heroine in birth. If you desire to discover this vocation of yours, and reflect on different paradigms of success and fulfillment, I warmly invite you to join this class."

CLAS 60036,"Neoplatonic philosophy is one of the or maybe even the most influential intellectual movement in Late Antiquity, the Middle Ages and into modern times. Neoplatonic ideas shaped philosophical, theological, mystical and literary texts and art and architecture. The course will study a wide range of Neoplatonic texts and of texts inspired by Neoplatonism from Antiquity into the Middle Ages, including the Byzantine, Latin and Arabic tradition. As the intellecutal basis of the course, we will first study pagan Neoplatonism in late Antiquity. We will focus mainly on the founder of Neoplatonism Plotinus who transforms Platonic thought and combines it with Aristotelean ideas without neglecting Stoic input as well. Later developments in Neoplatonism will be dicussed as well, since they are the basis of Christian transformations of Neoplatonism (e.g. Porphyry, Proclus). Then we will move to the first Christian transformations of Neoplatonic thought in late Antiquity, especially Dionysius the Areopagite, but also Boethius and Augustine. After a briefer detour to Neoplatonism in Byzantium we will focus on the neoplatonic traditions in the Middle Ages, focusing especially on the first translations of Dionysius the Areopagite and his reception in philosophy, theology, mysticism and art. Furthermore, we will take a look at the Arabic tradition.Topics dicussed in the course will include: 1) The Good, the One and God; 2) Intellect; 3) Soul; 4) Self, person, self-consciousness; 5) the intelligible realm and the visible world; 6) body; 7) matter 8) evil; 9) freedom; 10) the ascent of the soul and the union with the divine; 11) art and its anagocial powerMost texts will be read in translation, but we will also look at selected passages in Greek or Latin (for those who read these languages; they are not a requirement for the course).The course is by design a graduate course, but could be opened to well-qualified undergraduates."

CNST 20003,"Back in 1787, Benjamin Franklin was asked what kind of government the new American Constitution created. He responded, a republic, if you can keep it. Today, many people are asking whether the republic-and thus democracy in America-as we know it will survive. Trust is low, polarization is high, and longstanding democratic norms are being shattered left and right. Some scholars have even suggested that the US is on the brink of a new civil war. Others, however, argue that things are not as bad as they seem.   This course tackles the big questions about current state of democracy in the United States. Is the US actually a democracy? (And is that different than a republic?) If so, how, when, and why did it become a democracy? Will the US remain a democracy? Finally, what role can YOU play in keeping the republic?   This course is designed for students of all backgrounds and majors. Whether you have thought a lot or a little about the state of democracy in America, you are welcome in this class.   "
CNST 20200,"This course will focus on the relationship between democratic institutions, peace, and economic/human development. While drawing on lessons from North America and Europe, we will focus largely on countries of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. During the semester, we will discuss and debate the merits of various explanations or hypotheses that political scientists have proposed to answer the following questions: Why are some countries more developed and democratic than others? Is development necessary for democracy or democracy necessary for development? What is the relationship between culture, development, and democracy?  How do different types of political institutions affect the prospects for development and democracy? Should/how should U.S. and other established democracies promote democratization? By the end of the course, the objectives are that students (1) learn the most important theories intended to explain why some countries are more democratic and developed than others, (2) understand the complexity of any relationship between democracy and development, and (3) grow in the ability to think about and intelligently assess the strengths and weaknesses of strategies intended to promote democracy and development."

In  this class we not only look at a variety of crimes, but we also discuss the varying methods sociologists use to collect, interpret and evaluate data, as well as how we theorize about crime and punishment. We address questions such as Why are some people or groups labeled as criminal, while others are not? Do laws in both their construction and enforcement serve everyone's interests equally? How can the communities in which people are embedded be considered as criminogenic? How are poverty, race, gender and other social factors related to crime?"

They argued over which religion best suited a republic. Some said God had made certain people inferior to citizenship, while others shot back that God had made all people equally capable. One man's piety was another man's oppression. One woman's equality was another woman's blasphemy.. We will look at the colonial background and the founders' concerns, the 19th century and its myriad of reform movements and state building, religion's role in legal thought and education, the Scopes Monkey Trial, pacifism during time of war, the Civil Rights movement and its opposition, and the rise of the New Right.

Students will explore the social and political struggles that have shaped freedom and equality in the United States, including debates over protest, hate speech, pornography, religious freedom, gun control, abortion, race, gender, and homosexuality."
CNST 30013,"Political parties play many vital roles in American politics: They educate potential voters about political processes, policy issues, and civic duties. They mobilize citizens into political activity and involvement. They provide vital information about public debates. They control the choices--candidates and platforms that voters face at the ballot box. They influence and organize the activities of government officials. Most importantly, by providing a link between government and the governed, they are a central mechanism of representation. These roles--how well they are performed, what bias exists, how they shape outcomes, how they have changed over time--have consequences for the working of the American political system."
CNST 30022,"The Constitution holds a unique place in American law and political culture. Not only is it the basis of the federal government, it provides the framework for political debates about all manner of controversial issues in modern America. Today, there is much talk of a constitutional crisis in the United States. What does this mean? How can a history help us make sense of the Constitution and of our politics? This course explores the historical context in which the American Constitution was framed, ratified, and amended over time. Together, we will ask and answer the questions of how and why it was written the way it was; how and why it gained legitimacy; and how it was put into practice and interpreted over time. The class will introduce students to central historical problems, which include: Is the American Constitution democratic? Did the Constitution codify slavery into law? Is originalism a useful and valid way to interpret the Constitution? Course readings will consist primarily of primary source material, though students will also read historical interpretations of the Constitution and the process of forming, amending, and interpreting it. The discussion-based class will empower students to think historically about the American Constitution by interpreting primary source material, building arguments about causes and effects of particular constitutional points, and intervening in scholarly dialogues about the founding and its legacy. Students will be evaluated primarily based on class participation, a short primary source analysis, a role-play activity, and a final paper. "
CNST 30215,"Catholicism and Politics poses the question, both simple and complex: How ought Catholics to think about the political order and political issues within it?  The first part of the course will survey major responses to this question drawn from Church history: the early church, the medieval church, and the modern church.  The second part applies these models to contemporary issues ranging among war, intervention, globalization, abortion, the death penalty, religious freedom, gender issues, and economic development.  The course culminates in Vatican III, where teams of students, representing church factions, gather to discover church teachings on selected controversial political issues."
CNST 30227,"This upper division lecture course examines some of the most important events, ideas, and personalities that shaped late Imperial, Soviet, and post-Soviet periods of Russian history during the last one hundred years: from the outbreak of the First World War and the Revolutions of 1905 and 1917 through the Great Terror of the 1930s, the experience of the Second World War and the emergence of the Soviet Empire, late Stalinism and post-Stalinist developed or mature socialism, the collapse of the communist rule and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, as well as Russia's uneasy transition out of Totalitarianism and into Putin's authoritarianism during the first fourteen years of the twentieth-first century.  The course is designed for history majors as well as for students in other disciplines with or without background in modern Russian and East European history."
CNST 30245,"What role does international law have in the advancement of human rights, and how does human rights, in turn, advance international law? This course introduces university students to the general system of modern international law (e.g. its norm-generating framework involving States and non-State actors; the roles of many State and non-State authoritative decision-makers in shaping expectations of peaceful, just, and responsible behavior in the international system; its varied constellation of dispute settlement courts and tribunals, alongside the prospects and limits of enforcing State compliance with international decisions), specifically viewed from the lens of historic global, regional, and domestic challenges to human dignity that influenced the first global codification of human rights norms under the United Nations' 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, up to the present development of the current international system of protection for human rights. The course situates the framework of modern international law and civil, political, economic, social, and cultural human rights, using five examples of the historic, defining, and 'constitutionalizing moments' for the international system: 1) the international abolition of slavery; 2) the evolution from classical to modern international law in dismantling colonial empires to enshrine the self-determination of all peoples and the equality of sovereignty of all nations; 3) the outlawing of the aggressive use of force since 1929, towards the peaceful settlement of maritime and territorial disputes and the humanitarian rules applicable to armed conflict situations; 4) the establishment of international accountability of individuals and States for genocide, crimes against humanity and other human rights atrocities; and 5) the global regulation for sustainable use, shared protection, and intergenerational responsibility over natural resources (land, oceans, atmosphere, outer space). "
CNST 30255,"The Arab Spring represented a moment of challenge to intransigent repressive structures and aspiration to new democratic constitutional orders. To understand this moment we need to appreciate the complex history of the region. This is a survey course that approaches the intellectual history of Islam from a very specific angle: its encounter with Western political and intellectual thought. We will be looking at the first encounter with Greek political philosophy during the formative period of Arab-Islamic thought, in addition to Early and Late Modern responses to the European military and cultural challenge. The historical/comparative structure of the course makes salient the continuities and discontinuities in the thematic treatment of subjects like reform, representation, forms of government, the role of the community, and the rule of law. Some of the case studies that we will consider include Ottoman administrative and constitutional reforms, Arab nationalism, Lebanese consociationalism, and the Iranian Revolution and its constitutional project."
CNST 30402,"This course focuses on selected legal and policy issues related to K-12 education in the United States. A central theme is the intersection of K-12 schooling and the state, with a particular focus on Constitutional issues of religious freedom and establishment, student speech and privacy, parental choice, educational opportunity, and education reform trends such as charter schools and accountability measures.  Questions examined over the course of the semester include:  What are the most basic obligations of the state with regard to its regulation of K-12 education?  What are the most basic rights of parents in this regard?  In what ways does the 1st Amendment protect - and limit - the speech and privacy rights of K-12 schoolchildren?  In what ways may the state accommodate K-12 schools with an explicitly religious character? What are the Constitutional requirements with regard to religious speech or expression within K-12 public schools?  To what degree is the principle of equality manifest in the form of educational opportunity?  How has this changed over time?  In what ways have education reform trends such as charter schooling and increased accountability changed the policy landscape of K-12 education?"
CNST 30403,"Class examines philosophical, constitutional, and political questions pertaining to religion and politics, including: Do individuals have a right to religious liberty? If so, how might that right be protected? How does the American Constitution protect the right to religious freedom? What is the proper relationship between church and state? Is religion necessary, good, or bad for liberal democracy? Readings include selections from classical, medieval, and modern political philosophy, leading cases of American constitutional law, and contemporary legal theorist and political scientists."
CNST 30404,"Set against the first midterm elections of the Trump presidency, this course is an updated introduction to the political and lawmaking dynamics of the United States Congress. Once defined by pork-barrel spending, powerful committee chairmen, and limited competition, Congress is now dominated by gridlock and partisan warfare. The traditional legislative process appears to have collapsed as an avenue for policymaking, and Congress is now by far the least popular political institution in America. This course investigates how Congress is supposed to work, whether it ever actually worked that way, and what changed, bringing us to the biggest question: how it works - or doesn't work - today."
CNST 30405,"This course covers the various issues relevant to the current early childhood education landscape.  This includes theories of early learning and child development, policy development in the United States, the issues of inequality and the achievement gap (particularly related to K-12 Education Reform) and research on interventions or what works in early childhood programming.  The advantage to understanding the theories of child development, the policy context and the intervention research is that it gives future teachers and future policymakers a foundational premise upon which to grow, analyze, learn and teach.  Topics covered will include: Theories of Child Development (Infant Schools to Present), Head Start and the CCDBG, State Preschool, Inequality and the Achievement Gap in the Early Years and Interventions in Early Childhood (HighScope/Perry Preschool, Abecedarian and Chicago Parent Studies, Head Start Research).     The goal of this class is to come away with a greater understanding of the language, the history, the goals and the possibilities in this policy area as well as its connections to other social welfare programs and to K-12 schooling.  Students will become more fluent in the language of early childhood education and will gain the foundational knowledge of past and current theories, laws, policies and educational interventions."
CNST 30420,"Almost all crimes, or even human interactions, contain a digital component. The fact that old laws don't always fit new problems is no more apparent than in the area of cybercrimes. This course will include discussion of topics including: the methodology of typical cyber investigations, the application of the Fourth Amendment to digital evidence, and different types of cyber-specific laws enforced today. The course will also focus on the responses of both courts and legislators to the ever-evolving issues presented by computer crimes."
CNST 30423,"This course will explore the roots of philanthropy in American society, the role philanthropy plays within the modern economy, and how philanthropic activity helps us create a better world and strive for the common good. The key component of the course requires students to act as a Board of Directors and use thoughtful analysis to award real grants to deserving nonprofits (a sum up to $50,000). Students are expected to come to each class prepared to discuss course readings, and to offer ideas and suggestions regarding the grant making process. Each student is also expected to complete two site visits to nonprofit organizations outside of normal class hours. Students will nominate nonprofits for awards and the class will systematically discuss, analyze, and ultimately vote to award the grants. "
CNST 30428,"This course gives students the opportunity to learn more about how Americans have thought about criminal responsibility and how their ideas have changed over time. Historians contend that the 19th century witnessed a transformation in the understanding of the origins of criminal behavior in the United States. The earlier religious emphasis on the sinfulness of all mankind, which made the murderer into merely another sinner, gave way to a belief in the inherent goodness of humankind. But if humans were naturally good, how are we to explain their evil actions? And crime rates varied widely by sex and race; European women were said to have been domesticated out of crime doing. What do those variations tell us about a common human nature? The criminal might be a flawed specimen of humankind born lacking a healthy and sane mind. Relying in part upon studies done in Europe, American doctors, preachers, and lawyers debated whether insanity explained criminality over the century and how it expressed itself in different races and sexes. Alternative theories were offered. Environment, heredity, and free will were all said to have determined the actions of the criminal. By the early 20th century, lawyers and doctors had largely succeeded in medicalizing criminality. Psychiatrists now treated criminals as patients; judges invoked hereditary eugenics in sentencing criminals. Science, not sin, had apparently become the preferred mode of explanation for the origins of crime. But was this a better explanation than what had come before? Can it explain the turbulent debates in the late 20th and early 21st Centuries over variations in crime rates by race? Can it explain why men, not women, are still more likely to commit murder? "
CNST 30434,"This course introduces students to major actors, institutions, processes, and policies of substate governments in the United States. Through an intensive comparative examination of historical and contemporary politics in city governments, we will gain an understanding of municipal government and its role within the larger contexts of state and national government. Among the issues we will examine are representation, race and ethnicity, neighborhood development, and governing the multicultural metropolis."
CNST 30605,"France in 1700, ruled by the Sun King, Louis XIV, was the most powerful state in Europe, as well as a cultural center that drew the attention of the world.  At Versailles, just outside of Paris, Louis created a palace that symbolized his authority and still stands as a masterpiece of art and architecture.  Less than a hundred years later, in 1789, the French Revolution challenged and eventually destroyed the monarchy, with Louis XVI dying on the guillotine in 1793.   The course will be organized around major political developments, and seeks to understand how the monarchy could grow so powerful during the seventeenth century, and then collapse at the end of the eighteenth.   It will open with the establishment of the Bourbon family on the throne in 1589 and conclude with the rise of Napoleon in 1790s, with about one-third of the class concentrating on the revolutionary events that began in 1789.  Understanding the political fortunes of France will involve exploring the ways in which the nation was being transformed by a combination of social pressures and cultural conflict, in particular the Enlightenment.  In addition to reading a selection of works by historians students will read, view, and listen to some of the great cultural achievements of the time - the plays of Molière, the music of Lully, the novels of Voltaire, the paintings of David, to give just some examples."
CNST 30615,"This course will explore the intellectual foundations of the constellation of ideas that have become the dominant political worldviews in modern American society.  The course will focus on European sources of each tradition, as well as developments of each in America.  Concepts that will be explored include progress, historicism, pragmatism, liberty, equality, diversity, cosmopolitanism, localism, tradition, prescription, authority, secularism and religion, particularly Catholicism."
CNST 30622,"England's seventeenth century provides one of the most compelling epochs of human history, full of a cast of remarkable characters. Once Elizabeth I died in 1603, a new dynasty, the Scottish royal house, the Stuarts, came to the throne in the person of James VI and I. A new political dynamic ensued. Insoluble tensions arose between perceived licentiousness in high politics on one hand and puritan moral rigour on the other, between royal control of religion and a hankering after policies based on literal Biblical interpretation and also between a gaping royal treasury and public reluctance to contribute financially to the realm. These, and other factors, resulted in the unthinkable: the dissolution of the ties that had held English politics and society together. The Civil War (or Great Rebellion, or Puritan Revolution depending on the interpretation favoured) that resulted gave rise to a welter of new constitutional ideas, religious experiments and virulent anti-Catholicism. These were all set loose as King and Parliament fought for domination of the country. We will pay particular attention to the figure of Oliver Cromwell, who came to command English politics both before and after the hitherto unimaginable public execution of the king (who many believed was God's anointed). We will also ask why the English after allowing their king to be executed and their toleration a substantial Interregnum subsequently restored Charles II, their erstwhile king's son, as monarch. Remarkable figures that we will encounter and evaluate include the Leveller John Lilburne, the poet John Milton, Praise-God Barebones (yes, that is a name) and the libidinous Samuel Pepys."
CNST 30645,"This course in American political economy seeks to understand philosophically the relationship between politics and economics. We will begin by exploring the fundamental theories of economic life in the West through the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and Pope Leo XIII, paying particular attention to arguments for and against commercial society. We will then turn to the development of the American market and its role in shaping the character of individuals and the meaning of citizenship. Readings are drawn from, among others, Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton, Douglass, Wilson, Dewey, and DuBois. The course will end by considering the relationship between citizen and government in the contemporary United States. Throughout, we consider the ethics of the market economy, the system of production and exchange within which we live. Are its tremendous inequalities and accumulations just? How can we cultivate moderation amid consumerism? What role do virtue and leisure play in this system? Our task is to learn to produce and purchase in the service of a good life."
CNST 30646,"Economics and theology are often thought of as competing or contradictory explanations of human nature and behavior. By beginning with the theological premise that God's creation must hold together as a coherent whole, this course will instead show how economics rightly understood can illuminate our understanding of God's providential activity in the world. We will discuss the fundamental principles and insights of economics, relate them to a philosophical and theological vision of the human person in community, and show the central implications for ethics and political economy."
CNST 30647,"This course examines the recent history of the American university. It asks how the last four decades of political-economic restructuring often described as “neoliberalism” – skyrocketing personal debt, privatization of public goods, and more – have reshaped its social function and institutional structure, its labor struggles and relation to local communities. Through readings in critical university studies, ethnic studies, and American literature, we will build a conceptual vocabulary to critically engage these transformations and, in the process, ask fundamental questions about the modern university: what it is, who it is for, and what it might yet be."
CNST 30700,The Core Texts in Citizenship and Constitutional Government'' course sequence offers a select group of students an opportunity to study some of the seminal texts in history and philosophy of constitutional government.   Department approval required.
CNST 33200,"Was the Soviet Union a workers' paradise or an evil empire? Nearly three decades after this country transformed into what we now call post-Soviet space, the legacy of the USSR looms large in international politics and culture. This course will offer students an introduction to Soviet history through film, which Lenin famously called the most important of the arts, and literature, which Soviet writers used to engineer human souls. Since the 1917 Revolution, art has had a close relationship to the Soviet state. At the same time, writers and filmmakers with individualistic and even rebellious tendencies have created some of the twentieth century's greatest masterpieces, including Dziga Vertov's Man With a Movie Camera and Mikhail Bulgakov's Master and Margarita. In this class we will explore how this tense relationship between art and the state developed in the first half of the twentieth century. Since cultural context is an important lens for our analysis, each artistic work will be accompanied by historical readings about the period in which it was produced, as well as artistic manifestos and contemporary reviews, when relevant. All films will be shown with subtitles and all readings offered in English. Students of the Russian language have the option of discussing the course material in Russian once a week with the instructor in a group for an additional course credit. "
CNST 33902,"By the end of June 2023, the American Supreme Court will hand down a decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard. The case is likely to be one of the most consequential decisions on race and the American Constitution in recent history. This one-credit course will examine the decision and its various opinions. Prior Supreme Court precedents on affirmative action and the larger legal and political issues surrounding the case will also be addressed. The course will be co-taught by the Honorable Amul Thapar, judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and Prof. Vincent Phillip Muñoz."
CNST 40606,"Was the American Constitution originally a pro-slavery constitution that changed over time to a constitution that outlawed slavery and state-supported racial discrimination? Did the Civil War and subsequent developments through the civil rights acts of the 1960's represent a commitment implicit in constitutional principles from the nation's beginning? Do these constitutional principles embrace active governmental efforts to achieve an equal-opportunity society, including equal educational opportunity and an end to racism, a private attitude? Do constitutional principles promise a color-blind society? Or do they promise no more than color-blind governments? This course addresses these questions. Readings will include state documents like the Declaration of Independence and The Federalist Papers, the speeches of American politicians and other public figures, and decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court regarding slavery, public accommodations, education, voting, housing, and employment. Grades will be based on mid-term and final exams. Texts TBA. "
CNST 50002,"In Constitutionalism, Law and Politics II: American Constitutionalism, we shall study fundamental texts of the American constitutional and political tradition in an attempt to answer questions such as: What is the purpose of government? What is the meaning of political equality? What is political liberty and how is it best secured? Since we lack the time for a comprehensive survey of American political thinkers, we shall examine select statesmen and critical historical periods, focusing on the Founding era, Lincoln and the slavery crisis, and the Progressive era and New Deal."
CSC 23200,"Students will work with a South Bend neighborhood to explore a structural challenge and, with the guidance of a local artist, respond to this challenge alongside community members in creating an artistic piece that serves the good of the neighborhood. This seminar will also provide a hands-on experience as students are exposed to practices of participatory research methods and the art-making process."
CSC 23911,"This course will combine hands-on experiences of creation care with study and reflections on ecological conversion and integral ecology, in the spirit of Pope Francis' environmental encyclical, Laudato Si'. The course will be held at the Franciscan Life Process Center, a Franciscan retreat center run by the Franciscan Sisters of the Eucharist and located on 230 acres of rural land outside of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The site is in a contemplative natural setting with three miles of nature trails, a restored native prairie, animal barns, an orchard and vegetable gardens, outdoor stations of the cross, and an outdoor rosary walk. Service projects to be undertaken during the fall break course (2022) include: building a rain garden; winnowing prairie seeds; daily animal chores; and homegrown food processing and preparation. Daily course sessions will complement the service work and will involve discussion of readings from Laudato Si' and the ecological writings of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, as well as authors such as St. Bonaventure, Josef Pieper, Wendell Berry, Michael Pollen, Stratford Caldecott and others. Each student will be required to keep a journal integrating reflections on the readings with the service experiences. Daily integration sessions will be arranged each evening and prayer opportunities will be available. There is a $300 fee associated with this course."
CSC 30718,"This seminar will provide an overview of and framework to understand the global refugee crisis. We will trace the evolution of international refugee law and policy dealing with this ever-growing population. Central are the ethical challenges that refugees pose for the international community. What is the nature of our collective obligation to refugees? What determines the extent of this obligation? Through a series of legal and sociological case studies, students will also grapple with the social, legal , political and ethical challenges posed by humanitarian intervention on behalf of refugees and the often unintended consequences of such policies. How do the different models for dealing with refugee resettlement affect the life chances of refugees? This project-based course will pair students with a refugee community to address a pressing social concern."
CSC 30856,"This course explores the relationships among and between workers, employers, government policymakers, unions, and social movements since the end of World War II, as well as the ways in which those relationships have shaped and been shaped by American politics and culture more broadly. The United States emerged from the Second World War as the globe's unequaled economic and political power, and its citizens parlayed that preeminence into a long postwar economic boom that created, however imperfectly, the first truly mass middle-class society in world history. At the heart of that new society was the American labor movement, whose leaders and members ensured that at least some of the heady postwar profits made it into the wallets of workers and their families - and not just the wallets of union members, as working Americans generally experienced great improvement in wages, benefits, and economic opportunity during the quarter-century ending in 1970. During those same years, civil rights activists challenged the historic workplace discrimination that kept African Americans at the bottom of the labor market, confronting the racism of employers, unions, and the government, and inspiring others, primarily Mexican Americans and women, to broaden the push for equality at the workplace. Since that time, however, Americans have experienced a transformation in the workplace -- an erosion of manufacturing and the massive growth of service and government work; a rapid decline in number of union members and power of organized labor; and unresolved conflicts over affirmative action to redress centuries of racial and gender discrimination. Meanwhile, income inequality and wealth disparities have grown every year over the past three decades. What accounts for the decline of organized labor since 1970, and why have the people of the mythic land of milk and honey experienced declining upward mobility and widening gaps between the rich and everyone else? Are these phenomena linked? What has the decline of the labor movement meant for workers specifically, and the American economy and politics more broadly? How and why have popular perceptions of unions changed over time? What has been the relationship of organized labor to the civil rights movement, feminism, modern conservatism, and the fortunes of individual freedom more broadly? What is globalization, and what has been its impact upon American workers? Through an exploration of historical scholarship, memoirs, polemical writings, and films, this course will try to answer these questions and many others. It will also address the prospects for working people and labor unions in the twenty-first century."
CSC 30951,"This interdisciplinary research lab enlists students in the efforts of the Just Wage Initiative (JWI), a collaborative research and advocacy project of the Higgins Labor Program at the Center for Social Concerns. Students will help develop, refine, and update the Just Wage Framework, a multistakeholder online tool designed to advance a more inclusive and equitable economy. Students will also undertake research projects connecting their own intellectual interests and disciplinary expertise to the JWI's foundational question: What makes any given wage just or unjust? In addition, students will collaborate with the instructor and local, national, and international practitioners to envision and execute collaborative research and advocacy campaigns to promote a just wage economy. Extended weekly class sessions will feature visits by scholars and activists, as well as facilitate interactive group discussions and collaborative experiments."
CSC 30953,"This course will devote the first part of the semester to establishing an account of the historical roots of the current affordable housing crisis in the United States, paying particular attention to the local Michiana context. It will also introduce students to the housing “continuum of care” in the City of South Bend, noting the various institutional and governmental agencies currently involved in addressing housing needs as well as the gaps in coverage, e.g. the need for a permanent low-barrier intake center.   The second part of the course will involve community engagement as students begin to pursue specific research projects. Students will have the opportunity to network with area housing agencies and local government entities and research best practices in other urban areas. During this segment of the course, students will engage with experts in the field, both virtually and in person.  This work will lead into their own constructive proposals for a concrete contribution to meeting the current low-income and supportive housing needs locally, regionally, and/or nationally.  All these signs of the times will be held in conversation with Catholic social teaching, exploring  the concept of housing as a human right and duty in service of the common good."
CSC 33308,"Business in the Neighborhood is focused on engaging the intersection of Catholic social tradition (CST), and other broadly theological perspectives, with business and economic practices. Special attention is paid to a vision for economic justice and the way local economic practices can be informed and animated at those intersections. This course will engage discussion around economic justice in community and will provide opportunity for students, individually and in groups, to envision creative expressions of business toward the Common Good. Please note: This course satisfies the pre-requisite requirements for any of the Washington Policy Seminars."
CSC 33309,"This one credit course is an introduction to the philosophy and practice of asset based community development (ABCD) as a distinct approach to seeking the Common Good and creating social change. As a course designed to explore the question- What does it look like to create meaningful change at the local level?-- students will gain understanding of the development of ABCD, engage with models and variations of implementation, interact with local practitioners employing ABCD-styled strategies on the ground, and learn tools for pursuing the Common Good in community. Throughout the semester, students will work collaboratively to envision localized, nuanced implementation of general ABCD principles. Students will leave this course with a capacity to understand localized root causes of inequity and a deepened appreciation for the possibility of social change in a given community."
CSC 33310,"This course explores the interaction of thinking and action for justice, of cognitive science and social change. In this contested moment, how might we examine the ideas with which we think as we envision social transformation and work toward solidarity and the common good? We will draw from psychology and neuroscience to understand how to overcome attribution errors, implicit bias, and motivated reasoning in work to promote justice. We will examine how assumptions about knowledge and our theories of mind impact our communication and work, and explore epistemic justice (who is invited to the table of knowledge). We will explore, in seminar format, means to promote intellectual humility, ethical imagination, practical wisdom, and commitment to action. Students will be encouraged to learn through experience and community engagement, and apply the lessons of the course in their own journeys."
CSC 33311,"This course will draw from multiple perspectives to foster a deep appreciation of human development and flourishing. Human development is complex and fragile, yet many splendored. Assumptions about human nature and capacities have critical and moral implications for how we create institutions (family life, education) and systems (policy, government). e challenge is to develop an integrated and ecological understanding of development in the context of human flourishing. We will begin with research in positive psychology on human development, considering the growth of reasoning, identity, moral imagination, and behavior. We will broaden the frame to include understanding of human capabilities from the perspectives of faith (including the principles of Catholic social teaching), culture, and work. Students interested in social change will benefit from a deeper understanding of human development and related research, discussed in a seminar format. Students will draw from their own developmental journeys and current engagements while exploring means to foster human flourishing in future contexts."
CSC 33312,"This research lab will employ an interdisciplinary approach to research on a range of issues related to mass incarceration. Collaborating with faculty, scholars, activists, practitioners, those impacted by systems of incarceration, and other classmates, students will develop, refine and implement a research project which contributes to the overall body of scholarship on incarceration. Students will be able to design projects (exploring moral, normative, and/or empirical etc. dimensions of incarceration) which connect their own academic and intellectual interests to emerging research questions at the Center for Social Concerns. This research lab is open to students in all disciplines."
CSC 33313,"Just Life is an interdisciplinary exploration of what it means to live an ethical life of purpose, meaning and impact. Drawing on philosophy, political theory, sociology and theology but also on contemporary fiction, the course will explore moral purpose, theories of justice and understandings of why and how we are called to the common good. It will foreground core principles of Catholic Social Teaching linking them to other disciplinary and theological traditions. The course will also introduce students to research and evidence linking robust moral purpose to positive health outcomes and higher levels of happiness. But more significantly, it will provide a space for students to begin discerning their own moral purpose beyond the predictable false binaries of money or happiness or success or community. It will also challenge students to consider how they might support the common good across their life times in whatever profession or community they find themselves a part of. Through lectures, discussions, exercises, experiments and short essays this course is where students will come to understand that living a just life is an all-day, every day pursuit, it is a way of life, it is not what you do but who you are or can be. Being good means doing good. Students must be part of the Center for Social Concerns McNeill Justice Fellows program to take this course. "
CSC 33314,"During this course, the student will gain a deeper understanding of their unconscious bias towards differently-abled people in society, and study theories of mindfulness, giving voice, empowerment, and existing public policies governing society’s acceptance of differently-abled people. This course focuses on the challenges those will disabilities face in their daily lives. It will look back at the history of how people with disabilities were initially treated, introduce the baseline on current policies, and subsequent laws that were established, to spotlight issues on inclusion and diversity, and other relevant social justice issues pertaining to this topic. Evin Hartsell shares his personal story in his book, Abled In A Disabled World, which he completed two weeks before his death in April 2018. Evin speaks directly to the reader by making an incredibly wise declaration at the beginning of his book, “I am the same as you, I just look different”. During this course, the student will gain a deeper understanding of their unconscious bias towards differently-abled people in society, and study theories of mindfulness, giving voice, empowerment, and existing public policies governing society’s acceptance of differently-abled people."

The goal of this course is to summarize in a somewhat standardized fashion and with standard terminology a hopefully large cross-section of both the computing models of today, and the newer computing models that we may encounter in the near future. A big part of this is thus to step back and ask over and over again What do we really mean by computing? The emphasis is not on programming languages or architectures, but on the underlying way in which computation is carried out, usually expressed mathematically, and done in a way that allows a comparison to the power of the von Neumann model.

CST 30856,"This course explores the relationships among and between workers, employers, government policymakers, unions, and social movements since the end of World War II, as well as the ways in which those relationships have shaped and been shaped by American politics and culture more broadly. The United States emerged from the Second World War as the globe's unequaled economic and political power, and its citizens parlayed that preeminence into a long postwar economic boom that created, however imperfectly, the first truly mass middle-class society in world history. At the heart of that new society was the American labor movement, whose leaders and members ensured that at least some of the heady postwar profits made it into the wallets of workers and their families - and not just the wallets of union members, as working Americans generally experienced great improvement in wages, benefits, and economic opportunity during the quarter-century ending in 1970. During those same years, civil rights activists challenged the historic workplace discrimination that kept African Americans at the bottom of the labor market, confronting the racism of employers, unions, and the government, and inspiring others, primarily Mexican Americans and women, to broaden the push for equality at the workplace. Since that time, however, Americans have experienced a transformation in the workplace -- an erosion of manufacturing and the massive growth of service and government work; a rapid decline in number of union members and power of organized labor; and unresolved conflicts over affirmative action to redress centuries of racial and gender discrimination. Meanwhile, income inequality and wealth disparities have grown every year over the past three decades. What accounts for the decline of organized labor since 1970, and why have the people of the mythic land of milk and honey experienced declining upward mobility and widening gaps between the rich and everyone else? Are these phenomena linked? What has the decline of the labor movement meant for workers specifically, and the American economy and politics more broadly? How and why have popular perceptions of unions changed over time? What has been the relationship of organized labor to the civil rights movement, feminism, modern conservatism, and the fortunes of individual freedom more broadly? What is globalization, and what has been its impact upon American workers? Through an exploration of historical scholarship, memoirs, polemical writings, and films, this course will try to answer these questions and many others. It will also address the prospects for working people and labor unions in the twenty-first century."

DESN 20205,"Have you ever pondered how people live(d) in a world without television, YouTube, smartphones, and automobiles? Why have bellbottoms come and gone twice in the last 50 years? Will we be forced to relive the fashion mistakes of the 1970s and 1980s? What new stuff will people invent and sell next? In asking and answering these questions, we must focus on one underlying query: What does our stuff really say about who we are and who we want to be? This course combines lectures, discussions, and interactive small group activities to explore the nature and breadth of peoples' relationships with their things. We will investigate why and how people make and use different types of objects, and how the use of these material goods resonates with peoples' identities in the deep past, recent history, and today. Since everyone in the class will already be an expert user and consumer of things, we will consider how people today use material objects to assert, remake, reclaim, and create identities, and compare today's practices to those of people who lived long ago. Class members will learn about how anthropologists, including ethnographers (studying people today) and archaeologists (studying past peoples) think about and approach the material nature of our social, economic, and political lives. We will discuss why styles and technologies change through time, and why, in the end, there is very little new under the sun in terms of human behaviors and the way people produce and consume goods.

ENER 20333,"The Earth Focus course develops a narrative that pieces together the history of planet Earth over the last 4.5 billion years. Its violent beginnings, the changing orbital motions and seasons, the development of an atmosphere and oceans, all combined to produce a unique evolutionary history that formed a planet habitable by millions of life forms, including humans. The course introduces the science of natural climate change, including some drastic events that might leave you wondering how life could have survived. Understanding Earth's natural climate change is essential to analyzing and interpreting anthropogenic, i.e., human induced, climate change primarily brought about by the burning of fossil fuels over the last 150 years. The greenhouse effect will be used to explain how Earth has maintained its generally pleasant conditions,and climate models will be used to understand how small changes in CO2 levels can affect those conditions. With the ongoing consumption of fossil fuels, and the resulting addition of greenhouse gases into Earth's atmosphere, mankind is now conducting a unique experiment, one with potentially devastating consequences. Over the last century, the world has become highly industrialized and interconnected. The combustion of fossil fuels has played a major role in this process, and the consequences have become apparent with increasing pollution and climate issues. Earth is already beginning to react badly, e.g., a rise in ocean levels, weather extremes, ocean acidification, and extinction of species. How much the rising CO2 concentration and temperature will affect life on Earth is the question that scientists, politicians, economists, sociologists,as well as the rest of us, must consider in assessing what lies ahead. Decisions need to be made in the foreseeable future that will affect energy use, lifestyles, national economies, and international politics. Renewable and alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear are essential components of the energy discussion. A clear understanding of the science involved in the climate warming debate and potential solutions are necessary. It is up to each of us to examine the basic evidence and answer fundamental questions regarding what to do next. The goal of the course is to provide the history, science, and an understanding of the basic energy issues that face us in the 21st century with the goal of finding effective solutions. The focus will be on the facts and the underlying science,but it is also about the options and decisions that we, individually and as a society, must make regarding the very real implications of climate change."

Using the study of naughty narrators as an introduction into narrative theory, this course will think about the study of narrative not just as the study of relations, but also as the performance of a storyteller. This course will focus on how naughty narrators are often social pariahs – differently abled, casually overlooked, racially marginalized, or even children. Our job will be to study how these badly behaved storytellers perform in a transgressive way against a world that has framed them as a problem from the start."
ENGL 20290,"Many writers of the Early Modern period regularly include physically and mentally impaired characters in their poetry, prose, and plays. Shakespeare and his contemporaries were obsessed with portraying disability on the Elizabethan stage, and John Milton gives us poignantly moving poetry about his struggles with blindness; representations of disabled bodies and minds appear at every turn in the literature of the period. However, until very recently, almost no scholarship has considered the cultural, social, and material contexts of these early modern representations of disability. In this course, we will consider how and why early modern writing displays such an abiding anxiety about disability, paying close attention along the way to the materiality of disabled bodies and how the body itself shapes disability discourse. Through our inquiries, we will better understand how early modern texts both reflect and challenge modern ideas about disability and the human body. "
ENGL 20301,"A cliché, a painful truth, an old story, a new one—this course explores alcohol and alcoholism in Irish literature, Irish society and Irishness, examining how alcohol infuses the stories Irish people tell and those told about them, and asking what happens if we take alcohol(ism) seriously as a framework and topic of analysis. We will think about the romance and conviviality of drink and drinking, pubs and wakes and more; and counterposed crusades against drinking (by Father Mathew and others), as well as the unromantic and destructive dimension so central to recent writing. We will think about alcohol(ism) in relation to political authority and nationalism, as well as in relation to colonial resistance, recalcitrance and recovery. We will ask how this inheritance travels into Irish America, and even to this campus, asking what legacies are being lived out, and why, and what we make of that. The course will feature a diverse set of texts across a span of Irish literary tradition, including medieval and contemporary, fiction and memoir, poetry and prose, verbal, visual and musical media.

ENGL 20321,"As a term in European cultural history, decadence most often indicates a late-nineteenth-century movement in which writers and artists provoked the respectable middle class with racy, sordid, overblown and/or absurdist subject matter and methods.  This course explores that environment but also takes a broader view, examining alternative visions of decadence over the last two centuries and more, where decadence becomes one way of viewing secular modernity more generally.  Our materials include fiction, poetry, drama, philosophy, visual arts, cinema and criticism.  Early on, we lay conceptual groundwork with texts by Freud and Nietzsche.  Well-known authors (in addition to Freud and Nietzsche) include Charles Baudelaire, Oscar Wilde, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Walter Pater, Virginia Woolf, and Patrick Süskind.  We also read several lesser-known authors and study films by Ken Russell, Peter Greenaway and Sally Potter.  Please note that our discussion matter is not for the prudish or faint-hearted.  Bring a tolerance for the grotesque and a readiness to think carefully about authors who deliberately challenge deeply held Western attitudes concerning morality and values.  Assignments include two written exams (one or more in take-home format), an interpretive paper, and bi-weekly reflective writings."
ENGL 20381,"The British, crazy about Indian food and regarding chicken tikka masala as their “national dish”? The field sport cricket, invented in Britain, now closely followed in India and Pakistan while superseded in Britain by soccer/football?  These odd but seemingly innocuous facts point to the rich and often quite dark history of British India.  This history involves the development of British administrative and commercial governance by Britons in India and adjacent states, with origins as far back as the 1600s. We explore novels, short stories, and films treating the high-point of British-Indian power for Britons, around the 1880s, and follow through to its dissolution in 1947. We pay added attention to the aftermath of the Empire up to the present. Most of our reading materials are by British individuals who found themselves in British India and took to writing about it for a homeland marketplace with a taste for the “exotic.” We read some canonical authors--such as E.M. Forster with A Passage to India, George Orwell and Rudyard Kipling—and several less canonical authors. We also watch two modern Indian films set in British India and conclude with the Indian Salman Rushdie’s remarkable novel Midnight’s Children. Written work includes several short papers and regular (required but ungraded) reading journals."
ENGL 20436,"Ireland produced one of the most unique, extensive, and oldest literatures in Europe. In this class we look at a wide range of stories -- saints' lives, political poetry, myth and legend, heroic epic, lament, and placelore -- from ca. 800-1800 C.E. We learn about the changing religious, political, cultural and intellectual contexts to which these Irish women and men responded with their powerful compositions. We ask: what did Irish writers record about their conversion from paganism to Christianity? How did they use Gaelic poetry to protest invasion and English colonization? How did texts created by and about remarkable women like St. Brigit, the warrior-queen Medb, and the keening poet Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill, address issues of gender and power in a heavily patriarchal Ireland? In this class we think about the transformative potential of words, and ask the question: what is literature, and how do we recognize and appreciate it? What defines Irish literature, and what has made it so politically and culturally dynamic? By looking at authors ranging from saints and scholars to dispossessed poets and grieving women, we examine the voices from Ireland's past that still speak to us today.  "
ENGL 20560,"In our day C.S. Lewis is chiefly remembered as an apologist and writer of fiction for children, but in his own day he was a celebrated literary critic and scholar of the medieval imagination, who packed out auditoriums for his lectures on pre-modern literature. This course uses his lesser-known scholarly and critical writings to understand the enduring, hypnotic appeal of his fictional literature. We will read some of the works of literature he admired most (such as poems by Spenser, Dante); selections from Lewis's essays, sermons, critical writings, and lectures; as well as select poems, letters, and passages from his science fiction and myths for children."
ENGL 20680,"In this course, we will examine writers who engage ghosts, haunting, and the supernatural to explore how oppressive systems of power, though pervasive, are rendered imperceptible due to their historical persistence. We will unpack how writers engage with ghosts and the supernatural to interrogate issues of power, gender, race, sexuality, and class. We will critically examine what these classed, gendered, and raced intersections reveal to us about American culture, ideology, history, identity, and future trajectories. We will interrogate, reflect, and deconstruct how writers affirm, challenge, and negotiate identity and conceptualize American society through their engagement with ghosts."
ENGL 20720,"This literature course offers an opportunity to read, discuss, and write about a generous sampling of contemporary American poetry by living Latinx poets, utilizing as its principal text the anthology, The Wind Shifts: New Latino Poetry. There will also be a special module on Latinx poetry inspired by Latinx art, with particular attention to the Smithsonian American Art Museum's exhibit: Our America: the Latino Presence in American Art. We will also be relying significantly on a series of online resources, including video interviews with Latinx poets conducted here at Notre Dame. We will focus mainly on mid-career writers, discovering and examining some of the themes that characterize Latinx poetry. A number of the poets who we'll be reading will be special guests, via ZOOM, at various points during the semester: we'll get to ask them questions, and watch and hear them read some poems. We'll also encounter poems that challenge what one might expect when one hears the term, Latinx poetry."

ENGL 20791,"Gazes are gravitational forces. They can erect and deconstruct identities, ideologies, and geography. This course investigates the ideological tensions that inform the gaze and how this gravitational force is experienced, produced, enforced, and reimagined by marginalized beings. It also reevaluates the gaze itself; we will examine the gaze within cinema, as a form of self-expression, institutional power, and a critical lens through which to question our looking practices. We will investigate how nationalism, race, gender, sexuality, ability, and class produce gazes while examining alternative gazes that envision an elsewhere. Context will guide our discussion as we consider how gazes are enforced within family, work, and political structures. Throughout the semester, students will research various interdisciplinary approaches to the gaze, consider their personal looking practices, and create a gaze of their own. This course takes an intersectional approach to the gaze; possible texts include La Llorona, Lilo and Stitch, and poetry by Alan Pelaez Lopez and Larry Mitchell."
ENGL 20836,"When discussions of modernism and modernity focus on the late nineteenth, early twentieth centuries, they also often center on those qualities of the movement described in the work of early modernist literary critics, such as Harry Levin or Edmund Wilson.  Such examinations emphasized the modern movement's ehperiments in form, structure, linguistic representation, characterization, etc., while paying much less attention to the role of the modernist movement in the larger context of a given culture.  In this course, we will explore the significance of the modern movement from the perspective of specifically American culture, as well as the manner and meaning of American literary participation in the movement.  To that end, we will consider not only the work of authors generally accepted as American modernists, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway; we will also consider the role of authors such as Henry James and Edith Wharton, whose work bridges the late 19th-century and the modernism of the early 20th-century,  and Theodore Dreiser , of the early Chicago Renaissance (1910-1925), as well as a number of authors from the Harlem Renaissance - all authors the consideration of whose work enlarges and expands traditional conceptions of American modernism.  Along the way, we will examine pertinent issues such as social class, social mobility, gender relations, progressivism, primitivism, race and ethnicity, immigration, cosmopolitanism vs. regionalism, and the importance of the vernacular,  especially as these inform the question of Americanness and its role in our understanding of American literature during this time.   The overarching goal of our exploration  will be the effort to arrive at a much more comprehensive, more nuanced perspective on the meaning and significance of the modern in American culture.  In exploring these different vanatage points in American literary modernity, we will seek to reimagine the contours of  the modern in the American context from the perspective of American modernisms, while drawing important conclusions about their significance within the larger modernist context. "
ENGL 20960,"Considering the contemporary rise in the aesthetics of the genre of black horror, this course will explore literary and artistic horror(s) that black artists examine in America. We will work to study how black horror reminds us of the power of crafting narratives in America. We will be watching numerous horror films and shows and reading numerous literary authors. We will be reading and working with authors like: Toni Morrison, Richard Wright, Gwendolyn Brooks, James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, and many others. A close observation of this genre will allow us to question what constitutes horror and how is it connected to the humanities, law, and elements of science as well? This course is designed to help you build sound critical arguments and analysis by writing multiple genres of essays like a narrative essay, a close analysis essay, a podcast essay, and a final research essay."
ENGL 22760,"This is the discussion session for Witnessing Climate Change (ENGL 20760), thus, enrollment in both ENGL 22760 and ENGL 20760 (Or JED 30144) is required."
ENGL 27760,"This course is for undergraduate teaching fellows of Witnessing Climate Change (ENGL 20760). In this course we'll work collaboratively to think through the practical, theoretical, institutional, philosophical, political, and ethical aspects of addressing climate change through writing and teaching writing."
ENGL 30101,"This course provides beginning English majors with experience in the analysis, interpretation, and appreciation of literary works of different kinds and eras. Texts assigned will vary from one section to another, but all sections will include significant attention to poetry, as well as treatment of at least one other genre (fiction, drama, non-fiction prose). Frequent writing about works studied will introduce students to the practice of critical argument and consideration of how to read criticism as well as literature critically.    "
ENGL 30110,"In this class, students will learn about the beginnings of English literature, starting with the first surviving piece of literature written in English, Caedmon's hymn. No prior knowledge of medieval or early modern languages or literature is expected. Texts will be drawn from different genres, including riddles, lyric, epic poetry, drama, allegory, and romance. Readings will include Beowulf, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Julian of Norwich's Revelation, Spenser's Faerie Queene, Shakespeare's Winter’s Tale, and Milton's Paradise Lost. There will be several short paper assignments, passage analyses, and quizzes, but no midterm or final exam."
ENGL 30115,"Nations are narratives - so our historians tell us. That means the voices of a nation's artists and writers help to tell us who we are, even to create our very identity as a nation. So what are the narratives of our nation, the United States? This course traces the emergence of what we now know as America from the small and struggling British colonies of Virginia and New England, founded early in the 1600s on lands cultivated for millennia by Native Americans. We will consider the early contact zones in which settler societies from Europe met and mingled with indigenous Native American cultures, languages, and literatures; the institution of slavery as the foundation of American economies, and the growing contributions of free and enslaved African-Americans to the development of a distinctive American voice and literary tradition; and the literature of the American Revolution that established the United States as an independent nation. Finally, we will conclude with several works from the American Renaissance that characterize an emerging modern American literary tradition."
ENGL 30120,"The English Romantic poet William Blake declared, Poetry Fetter'd, Fetters the Human Race. This course explores this idea by providing an opportunity for students to deepen their understanding and appreciation of the power of poetic language - whether that is the power to unfetter perception and release the reader's mind into new understanding; the power to inspire social, cultural, or political change; or the power to give rich expression to fundamental human truths and experiences.  This course is intended for English majors who are seeking additional foundation in and experience with the study of poetry, while also completing distribution requirements within the major. It is also intended for non-majors who would enjoy fulfilling Core Curriculum designations (LIT and WRIT) through a course on poetry.  As we move through the semester, we will always be working to strengthen the ability to read poetry carefully and critically, form strong interpretations, and argue for those interpretations persuasively in both classroom discussion and writing.  We will address the major poetic genres, a variety of poetic forms, and a range of literary concepts and devices, reading poems both individually and in groupings.  The kinds of groupings we will study include poems that have been deliberately paired, including parodies; poems that are part of a particular volume; and poems clustered by poet. We will spend time thinking about the oral performance of poetry through different activities, including listening to recordings of poems, and thinking about the relationship between poetry and the image through works that engage with both media. We will read a variety of material, focusing especially on British and American poetry from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and also some contemporary poetry. Over the course of the semester we will try to understand why the poetry on our syllabus has spoken to readers over time, and how it might speak to us and about us."
ENGL 30490,"Public Speaking and Debate is a skills-based course designed to prepare students for the real world necessity of public speaking, while also cultivating the skills necessary to be competitive on the college speech and debate circuit if they so desire. Students will have the opportunity to join our Speech and Debate Travel Team and compete across the country in various events if they wish. The events range from 2 person team debate to individual persuasive speeches, to mock congresses, and even dramatic monologues! Team members are also eligible for scholarships for their participation. Day one of the course will be lectures and activities to allow students to become familiar with all competitive events as well as traditional public speaking for those students who do not wish to compete. We will dedicate day two to practicing the skills we learned the day before! Students will leave the course with an increased comfort with public speaking, extensive knowledge of persuasive speech, expanded analytical and critical thinking skills, and familiarity with the art of argumentation."
ENGL 30591,"When war comes, many might imagine that theatre and other forms of performance stop. But, among the many forms of resistance to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there has been a vast increase in the number of new plays representing the suffering and the resilience of the Ukrainian people, many of which have already been translated into English. There has, in contrast, been less attention paid to other forms of performance writing: for example, poetry being created for, or disseminated through, digital media, reaching audiences instantly with all the urgency of the moment. This course has as its central aim the exploration of these materials, both ones already in English translation and ones that might become available. It seeks to understand what has been created and how it is disseminated as cultural practice during the Russian invasion. It will run as a classroom on the Notre Dame campus, meeting simultaneously with one taught in English at the Ukrainian Catholic University, enabling collaboration and shared learning between ND and UCU students.  Thisthe course is equivalent to other English electives in content and the types of assignments, and no prior knowledge or course is expected (except for the English gateway of ENGL 30101, which is a co-req. for all English major electives)"
ENGL 30851,"In this course, students will read and model their poems upon writers who, by virtue of their talent and craft, have left their mark in English and American poetic traditions.  We will also examine performative aspects of poetry by attending a variety of readings either on or off campus.  Students will circulate their own poems among all the participants, who will then discuss and critique them in a workshop setting.  Throughout the semester attention will be given to those proven strategies for composing and revising one’s poetry.  Assignments will be fashioned so as to provide practice both in traditional forms and in free verse."
ENGL 30853,"Fiction Writing is an intermediate workshop for students who are interested in developing their fiction. In this course we will read a range of contemporary authors, either story collections or novels. By reading as practitioners of the art of fiction, students will engage in productive critiques via antiracist workshop practices and lead class discussion. Taking ENGL 20001 “Introduction to Fiction Writing” is highly encouraged before enrolling in this course."
ENGL 30857,"Hogwarts, Middle Earth, Westeros, Panem: every story starts somewhere. How do you build a compelling world that's not just backdrop, but part of the story? In this reading-intensive fiction workshop, you'll learn to create vivid and dynamic worlds, embed those worlds in your characters' thoughts, and bring those worlds to life through your characters' actions. While focusing primarily on fantastic, speculative, and weird fiction, this workshop will help you develop the skills you need to make any world breathe on the page - even this one. Readings will include work from William Blake, Kelly Link, George R.R. Martin, Nnedi Okorafor, Laurie Penny, J.K. Rowling, and Jeff VanderMeer."
ENGL 40203,"A person should be wise enough - but never too wise; life is most pleasant for those who know just enough. Old Norse proverb, from Hávamál.  In this course, students will come to grips with Old Norse - a term that encompasses the medieval vernacular languages of Scandinavia and the vernacular literatures that flourished in Norway and Iceland between the Viking Age and the Reformation. The Old Norse literary corpus is remarkable for its breadth and variety, its literary quality and its cultural value: Norse manuscripts preserve our fullest record of pre-Christian mythology from northern Europe; traditional Germanic narrative and poetic traditions are uniquely well-represented in Old Norse versions, some of which date back to well before the Conversion; in the Icelandic sagas, one of Europe's most distinctive medieval genres, we see an unprecedented forerunner of realistic prose fiction. Knowledge of Old Norse also gives access to many primary sources relating to the perennially controversial and fascinating Vikings, who took their language as far afield as Russia, Rome, Reykjavik and Rouen. (And Old Norse was probably the first European language spoken in North America.)   Over the course of a semester, we will learn the fundamentals of Old Norse grammar, syntax and vocabulary. Although it has some quirks, Old Norse is not a particularly difficult language to pick up, and students will soon be able to read a saga in the original. We will introduce students to the history and literature of medieval Scandinavia, using translations at first but gradually bringing in original language material as our mastery of Old Norse increases.  This course will be assessed by means of regular grammar quizzes and translation exercises, and a final exam.  "
ENGL 40206,"This course explores the phenomenon of Shakespeare in the cinema/movie theatre, examining ‘Shakespeare and film' by concentrating on the meanings provoked by the and that joins the terms. We shall be looking at examples of films of Shakespeare plays both early and recent, both in English and in other languages, and both ones that stick close to conventional concepts of how to film Shakespeare and adaptations at varying degrees of distance from his language, time, plot, reaching a limit in versions that erase Shakespeare from the film. We will also be looking at the recent phenomenon of Live from broadcasts of live theatre to movie audiences. The transposition of different forms of Shakespearean texts (printed, theatrical, filmic) and the confrontation with the specificities of film production have produced and continue to produce a phenomenon whose cultural meanings will be the subject of our investigations. There will be screenings of the films to be studied in the Browning Cinema."
ENGL 40233,"One of the most prolific authors in the modern period - the author of the twentieth century, according to one admirer - Tolkien is also one of the most influential, controversial, and challenging. He inspired a craze for fantasy literature that persists today and that itself has influenced the movies, games, and images of pop culture. As often as readers praise his novels, however, critics (particularly scholars) vilify them for their plots, style, and characters. Further complicating this reception is the fact that as a writer Tolkien, who by trade was a medievalist and philologist at the University of Oxford, produced far more than his well-known books on Middle Earth. In an effort to get a broad understanding of Tolkien as a writer and of the continuities that run through everything he wrote, we'll read these blockbusters, but also some of his original poetry, several of his academic articles, and his translations of medieval poems. We'll consider what it meant to be a writer when Tolkien was, including the way he balanced teaching and writing, the importance of his writers' group (the Inklings), and the process by which his sometimes illegible handwritten drafts found their way (changing in the process) to the finished products that shook the literary world."
ENGL 40234,"This course will introduce you to medieval romance, one of the most popular genres of medieval literature and one that gives us some of the best-loved literary characters of all time, including Lancelot and Guinevere. We will study the genre of romance, including Arthurian romance and other varieties, from the genre's inception. We will pay particular attention to the form of story-telling that it popularizes, the concept of love that it systematizes, and the notion of heroism on which it depends. We will read many texts in their original Middle English, but no prior knowledge of Middle English or medieval literature is expected."
ENGL 40292,"This invention of the printing press was, according to Francis Bacon, a technology that changed and altered the whole face and state of things throughout the world. In this course, we will read and examine a selection of books that are considered to have had a major impact on the literary and political culture of the Anglophone world. In each case, we consider the book in question as a material object and as a literary text. Syllabus will include More, Utopia; Bacon, Essays; Shakespeare, Hamlet and The Tempest; Bunyan, Pilgrim's Progress; Defoe, Robinson Crusoe."
ENGL 40371,"This course traces the gothic short story in British and American literature from 19th century (e.g. Washington Irving, Edgar Allan Poe, Sheridan Le Fanu, Thomas Hardy, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Robert Louis Stevenson) to the 20th century (e.g. M. R. James, H. P. Lovecraft, Eudora Welty, Shirley Jackson, Anne Rice). An important popular genre, the short story is a distinctive lens through which to view gothic literature's preoccupation with social, psychological, political, scientific, and moral issues. Key topics will include: vampires, revenants, and ghosts; trauma gothic; gothic bodies and body parts; American gothic; suburban gothic; gothic spaces; gothic theologies; queer gothic; and medical gothic. Through class discussions and written assignments, students will work on close-reading and critical thinking skills and discover the work of a variety of authors. As this is a close-reading class, students will usually read one short story for each class period."
ENGL 40450,"Dramatic genius... is kindling over the whole land. (Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine review; 1823)  This class approaches British Romanticism through the spectacular fecundity of its staged drama, which is not usually considered in conventional assessments of the period.  Alongside serious, often disturbing new tragedies, hilarious new comedies, and stunning revivals of Shakespeare, Romantic theater offered frenetic audiences a staggering range of experimental or fringe genres such as melodrama, Gothic drama, nautical drama, pantomime, and quadruped entertainments featuring live horses in cavalry charges and the herics of Carlo the Wonder Dog and Jocko the Brazilian Monkey.  We will explore the ingenious ways, both in print and on stage, playwrights utilized these and other stage practices to engage with the burning political issues of the time:  the French Revolution, slavery, imperial might and global strife, women's rights, among others.  Readings address major canonical figures-- Coleridge, Shelley, and Byron—as well as less well-known figures who ruled the stage, such as Joanna Baillie, Elizabeth Inchbald, Monk Lewis, and Hannah Cowley. "
ENGL 40544,"Storytelling allows us to make a place, and a past, come alive, and it is through narrative that certain people, locations, and experiences lodge themselves in our memories.  How, and why, do we reshape our own environment to convey certain stories about our past, our accomplishments, and our collective experiences? Why is it that road-trips loom so large in American cultural memory, and what do they have in common with other placelore stories, such as those featuring Native Americans, Irish saints and TV characters like Northern Ireland's Derry Girls? How can words, sounds and imagery be used to map out and draw us into new and often fantastic virtual geographies?  In this class, we will think about how stories gain power by being anchored in evocative depictions of specific places, both real and imagined. We will examine verbal and visual stories, from medieval manuscripts like the Book of Kells and tales of St. Patrick's travels around Ireland, to contemporary animation (Song of the Sea), murals from Northern Ireland, place-based television series (Derry Girls) and Chicago-based road-trip films (The Blues Brothers, Ferris Bueller's Day Off). We will contemplate how icons of ancient Ireland were used to create new spaces in Chicago, and we'll look at the massive 1893 World's Fair that put a newly rebuilt Chicago on the world map, as well as dramatic histories of Chicago and some of its murderous inhabitants (Devil in the White City). We will also turn to regional storytelling traditions and will study songs and stories about home composed by those who experienced diaspora and migration. "
ENGL 40555,"This class looks at how women's voices emerge in Irish literature/art from the bloodthirsty warrior queens and powerful sovereignty goddesses of medieval saga to today's activist punk poets and videographers, exploring both how women are represented by others and how they choose to answer back. We will consider key genres of Irish verbal art in a wide range of compositions from medieval to contemporary. We will be helped along by relevant literary, anthropological and cultural criticism. How do women speak? How do women speak? Are these works subversive of our expectations or conservative in their relation to the status quo? How can we acknowledge and deconstruct misogyny not as inevitable but as historically and contextually conditioned and subject to demystifying critique? What vantage can we gain on Irish literary history by asking these historical, theoretical and political questions? How do tradition and the canon look when we view them through a gendered lens? What kind of impersonations might we engage in when we read...and write? Genres considered include courtly love poetry, contemporary feminist verse, oral lament, modern love poetry, bardic verse, storytelling, early modern allegorical poetry, folk song, medieval allegory, and contemporary comic verse, all read in English. Your own work for the course will include papers of literary/cultural analysis, a presentation, and a creative writing option for those who want to flex those muscles. "
ENGL 40750,"Generative AI is a form of computing in which computer systems generate media such as text, images, sound, video, or combinations based on prompts or other information provided to the computer.  These systems, including, but are not limited to, ChatGPT, Midjourney and DALLE, have been evolving rapidly and have led to extreme excitement, confusion, and fear.  This course provides a survey of how to understand and use a number of these tools including explorations in prompt engineering as well as addressing issues from across the liberal arts including artistic, economic, social/psychological, educational and legal concerns and opportunities. "
ENGL 40758,"In this course we will undertake a comparative survey of the materialisms of twentieth-century American naturalist novels, tracing a trajectory from turn-of-the-century texts by Frank Norris and Stephen Crane, to the neo-naturalist fiction of a few decades later that operated alongside developments in modernist literary form (Gertrude Stein, Ann Petry, John Steinbeck), and concluding with a look at its postwar resurgence in the novels of authors such as Don DeLillo and Cormac McCarthy. We will also discuss the return to these novels in recent films including There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men. "
ENGL 40766,"What happens when poetry goes public? What can poems do in the world? And how do matters of urgent public import - matters of race, gender, class, war, and environmental collapse - shape the patterns of feeling and thought that poems make possible in the private recesses of our hearts and minds? These are just some of the questions we'll take up in this survey of modern and contemporary American poetry. Our goal is to explore the past 120 years in verse by framing poems as performative, contagious, sometimes clamorous, always thoroughly social things: textual objects produced in and for particular communities of readers, built to travel on the tongue and in a variety of media, and often tasked with vital public work. From the modernist scandals of Dada New York to Amanda Gorman's celebrated inaugural poem in 2021, our inquiry will pivot around key moments in U.S. literary history when poets transfixed and transformed public audiences. Central figures are likely to include T. S. Eliot, Gertrude Stein, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, George Oppen, Gwendolyn Brooks, Frank O'Hara, Adrienne Rich, Claudia Rankine, and Layli Long Soldier, but we'll read widely (and closely) across movements, schools, styles, and forms. As we wrestle with popular narratives about poetry's cultural position in the U.S. (from handwringing concerns about poetry's obsolescence to recent hype over the flourishing of poetry in digital spaces), we'll also engage landmark statements from a variety of critical perspectives on the social life of poetry. Ultimately and together, though, we'l come to our own conclusions about why poems matter, and where poetry is headed in the twenty-first century."

To that end, we will consider not only the work of authors generally accepted as modernists, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein; we will also consider the role of authors such as Sherwood Anderson and Waldo Frank, of the early Chicago Renaissance (1910-1925), and a number of authors from the Harlem Renaissance. We will examine the work of these authors not only in the context of modernism, but also as it relates to many issues of the day, including progressivism, primitivism, race and ethnicity, immigration, cosmopolitanism vs. regionalism, and the importance of the vernacular, in addition to the question of Americanness and its importance to an understanding of American literature during this time. Considering these different vantage points in American literary modernism, we will try to imagine the contours of American modernisms, and draw some conclusions about their significance within the larger modernist context. In so doing, we'll seek to arrive at a more comprehensive, more nuanced perspective on the meaning of the modern in American literature and culture.Course Texts: Edith Wharton, Age of Innocence; Willa Cather, O Pioneers!; Sherwood Anderson, Dark Laughter; Waldo Frank, Holiday; Theodore Dreiser, Sister Carrie; Ernest Hemingway, Torrents of Spring; F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby; Gertrude Stein, Three Lives; Jessie Fauset, Plum Bun; Jean Toomer, Cane; William Faulkner, Absalom! Absalom! Course Requirements: Two 5-page essays, two 5-page drafts, and a presentation."
ENGL 40850,"Advanced Fiction Writing is an advanced workshop for students with a serious commitment to writing fiction. This course will look to examine contemporary conversations regarding race, diaspora, trauma, and ecological disaster, for us to - as Chris Abani notes - redress the art of an existential wound. We will read a range of contemporary authors, either story collections or novels. Discussions will also include contemporary publishing practices, placing work in literary journals, and pursuing writing beyond undergraduate study i.e., graduate programs. By reading as practitioners of the art of fiction, students will engage in productive critiques via antiracist workshop practices and lead class discussion framing. The emphasis will be the individualized reading of student work with the goal to refine their authorial voice. "

ENGL 40873,"The 2016 film I Am Not Your Negro encourages a new generation to explore the life and work of James Baldwin (1924-1987). Directed by Haitian-born filmmaker Raoul Peck, I Am Not Your Negro is a provocative documentary that envisions a book Baldwin never finished by providing insight into Baldwin's relationship with three men who were assassinated before their fortieth birthdays - Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr.  In this course we will interrogate questions of race, sexuality, violence, and migration. Our current political moment encourages the examination of these issues while Baldwin's life and work provides the ideal vantage point for their investigation. Using I Am Not Your Negro as our starting point, Baldwin's life and work will allow us the opportunity to explore transatlantic discourses on nationality, sexuality, race, gender, and religion. We will also explore the work of other writers including Richard Wright, Frantz Fanon, Audre Lorde, and Ta-Nehisi Coates. "
ENGL 40970,"In this course, we explore questions of gender and sexuality across a range of cultural contexts to ask: what, if anything, makes social identities different in the global south and the global north? What might it mean to feel strange––and in whose eyes might someone appear strange? What do we even think strangeness is? We’ll explore how theories of gender and sex intersect with recent queer and trans fiction and nonfiction from the global south, and if they might offer theoretical frames of their own. Readings will include work from Agha Shahid Ali, Akwaeke Emezi, Ismat Chughtai, Carmen Maria-Machado, Virginia Woolf, and theory from Sara Ahmed, Paul B. Preciado, Susan Sontag, Alok Vaid-Menon, and others."

ENGL 48000,"This course offers students the opportunity to work on a faculty member's research project. The faculty member must write a description of the research project, the specific work to be completed by the student, and the method of assessing the student's work. To receive three credits the project should involve the equivalent of the work in a three-credit English course. Students may count no more than one ENGL 48000 towards the English major."
ENGL 53001,"The Honors Colloquium will introduce students completing the honors thesis to research methods in literary studies. Students will complete a series of assignments designed to enable them to develop her thesis topic. They will conduct research in consultation with their thesis advisor and begin work on the thesis project, which will be completed in the Spring semester."
ENGL 53002,"This is a class for students working on their creative honors thesis. It will serve three main purposes: to support the writing of the thesis as well as the required essay that accompanies the thesis; to introduce students to a range of theories and perspectives on the literary craft and vocation; and, if they are so inclined, to help prepare students to apply for graduate programs."
ENGL 58999,Research and composition of a thesis in English.
ENGL 90007,"This course will train students in the forensic approaches to the medieval manuscript book as a physical artifact. Students will learn to collect and interpret codicological data (e.g., collation, layout, decoration, distribution of scribal labor, book bindings, provenance, etc.). These skills will culminate in the ability to generate analytical manuscript descriptions and to integrate them into a larger research program. Specific treatment will be given to problematic genres of manuscripts such as Bibles, liturgical and music manuscripts, calendars, books of hours, legal texts, and fragments. In addition to the acquisition of codicological skills, students will learn to identify texts and develop a command of the secondary resources and bibliographic reference materials essential to the critical study of manuscripts. Students will work extensively with the medieval manuscripts in the collections of the Hesburgh Library and acquire plenty of hands-on experience. Pre-requisites: Students must be proficient in Latin; a previous course in Latin paleography is not required, but recommended."

The principal aim of the course is for each student to generate poetry of publishable quality by the end of the semester, and for the student in the second year of the program to complete the MFA thesis. Reading assignments are aimed to encourage and to sustain ongoing discussions on craft and poetics. The operative words here are diversity and plurality. We will also consider the current landscape of poetry publishing, especially that of first books.    "
ENGL 90092,"In this course we'll work collaboratively to think through the practical, theoretical, institutional, interpersonal, political, and, oh yes, artistic implications of teaching creative writing at various types of academic institutions as well as in community settings."
ENGL 90131,"In the literary world, the debut is given great emphasis. So much so that the debut author often feels an exorbitant amount of pressure to succeed with one book. In this course we will analyze and critique this construct by reading a range of diverse writers spanning the 20th and 21st century. We will problematize the industry obsession with new talent, and explore productive ways of managing these external pressures. Students will also generate work using in-class prompts in order to further develop their authorial voice."
ENGL 90220,"This course will explore the wealth of literature associated with Scotland from about 1300 to 1603 and the unification of the Scottish and English crowns. During this time, Scots writers (or makars) drew widely on models from the Continent (especially Latinate traditions), England, and Scotland itself. They addressed political issues like Scottish independence, literary issues like the fashioning of native Scots traditions, social issues like the legal infrastructure of Scotland, cultural issues like the impact of Humanism, and whimsical issues like the wisdom of animals. Often bypassed because of its language and because it does not fit neatly into paradigms of English literary history, Middle Scots literature produced some of the greatest and least read masterpieces of medieval Britain, including John Barbour's Bruce, Robert Henryson's Moral Fables and Testament of Cresseid, William Dunbar's lyrics, Gavin Douglas's Palis of Honour and Eneados, Richard Holland's The Buik of the Howlat, and David Lindsay/s Dreme. We will read many of these works for their intrinsic and historical significance, and also consider relations between Middle Scots literature and textual production, including the importance of large individual manuscripts (like the Bannatyne, Asloan, and Maitland manuscripts), the repurposing of Scots poems in southern Middle English works, and the impact of Edinburgh/s nascent printing trade."
ENGL 90259,"In the wake of the Reformation-era's massive upheavals, devotional poetry in the English language flourished. This body of literature offers its readers the opportunity to explore questions pertaining broadly to the study of lyric and to the study of the relationships between religion and literature. Early modern devotional poetry oscillates between eros and agape, private and communal modes of expression, shame and pride, doubt and faith, evanescence and transcendence, mutability and permanence, success and failure, and agency and helpless passivity. It experiments with gender, language, form, meter, voice, song, and address; it became a key means for exploring the subjective experience of living the theological ideas and changes of the Reformation period. Given this poetry’s  broad-ranging vitality, it is no surprise that contemporary scholarship on devotional poetry engages deeply with theology, history, lyric theory, gender, and sexuality. Authors we'll read will likely include Thomas Wyatt, Anne Locke, Mary Sidney, Philip Sidney, Robert Southwell, Henry Constable, John Donne, George Herbert, Robert Herrick, Henry Vaughan, Richard Crashaw, and John Austin. The course will offer two tracks adjustable to student interests and professional development."
ENGL 90278,"This course explores the phenomenon of Shakespeare and film, concentrating on the meanings provoked by the and in the course-title. We shall be looking at examples of films of Shakespeare plays both early and recent, both in English and in other languages, and both ones that stick close to conventional concepts of how to film Shakespeare and adaptations at varying degrees of distance from his language, time, plot, reaching a limit in versions that erase Shakespeare from the film. The transposition of different forms of Shakespearean texts (printed, theatrical, filmic) and the confrontation with the specificities of film production have produced and continue to produce a cultural phenomenon whose cultural meanings will be the subject of our investigations. There will be screenings of the films to be studied in the Lab."
ENGL 90346,"The ballad is one of the major poetic traditions of world literature. Precisely what a ballad is, however, remains a remarkably vexed question. For the literary scholaballad is often used to mean a narrative poem, but this definition does not do justice to a vastly more complex history, which traverses oral traditions, folklore, urban popular song, and cheap print. This course will explore various elements of the ballad both in print and performance, in an attempt to forge new connections between poetry and song. We will learn about the fascinating history of the popular ballad, and how it gave shape to English literature as a discipline. We will engage with ballad archives, which provide a fascinating glimpse into popular urban street song and the mentalities of ordinary people. We will think about the global circulation and distribution of ballads and their relationship to place. And we will consider the advantages and limitations both of print archives and performance studies for conceptualizing the song traditions of the past. Our focus will primarily be on English, Scottish, and Irish Ballads, though this is not a subject that lends itself well to national and political boundaries, so we will follow the songs throughout the Anglophone world and beyond. The course will require a series of readings and listenings, and will include discussion of a diverse array of materials from Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, and John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, through Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Marinere, and nineteenth-century slip songs, to the Podcasts Dolly Parton's America, and Fire Draw Near."
ENGL 90541,"Many decades ago, Richard Ellmann wrote that “we are still learning to…understand our interpreter,” James Joyce. Ulysses is in many ways a “book of the future.” Though set in a specific past (1904) and written in times of great European wars (WWI, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence), it functions as a work “from the past postpropheticals” (an expression derived from Finnegans Wake). This course aims to propose a rereading of Joyce’s Ulysses in the light of possible hermeneutic interactions and adaptations to our world, in the context of what I call the “quantum theory of interpretation:” a hermeneutic effort based on interaction and guided by concepts such as relationality, uncertainty (indeterminacy), entanglement and so on. Starting from a recognition of past Joycean exegeses, our chapter-by-chapter (or rather episode-by-episode) reading of the great work will help us reflect on the fact that reading is to some extent always a projection into the unknown. We will consider and encourage new critiques which, in the awareness of the partial imponderability of interpretation, are worthy of investigation just as established and canonical commentaries."
ENGL 90690,"This graduate seminar will attend to U.S. literature from the late 19th century through the present with focus on literary and sonic registers of social and sound reproduction, performance, and gender and sexuality, and the interrelations among these. Beginning in the 1890s, immense changes took place in the ways Americans conceptualized gender and sexuality; at the same time, recording sound and playing it back transformed from a fantasy to a novelty to a common practice. While these sets of changes might initially seem disparate, they both have questions of reproduction—biological reproduction, social reproduction, mechanical reproduction—at their core. How did these rapidly changing conceptions of reproduction—along with co-constitutive conceptions of race, ethnicity, nationality, and sexuality—shape the concerns and forms taken up by American literature in the late 19th and 20th centuries? To address these questions, in this seminar we will read fiction by authors such as Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Jessie Fauset, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Pauline Elizabeth Hopkins, Gayl Jones, Nella Larsen, Claude McKay, Thomas Pynchon, and Edith Wharton, alongside readings in sound and performance studies, gender and sexuality studies, and cultural studies generally, including work by Walter Benjamin, Michel Foucault, Michael Gallope, Saidiya Hartman, Stuart Hall, Christopher Looby, Heather Love, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Hortense Spillers."
ENGL 90791,"This graduate seminar brings together two subfields of inquiry—science fiction studies and the inscriptional studies of science and technology—and two questions—how is science written in fiction and how is writing used in science—to account for the ways in which writing and science are, and have been historically and culturally, entangled. No prior knowledge of any subfield is required. You will read and engage with scholarship from literary criticism, history of science, science studies, and media technology studies. Students will likely encounter work from the likes of Thomas More, Fredric Jameson, Darko Suvin, Octavia Butler, Samuel Delany, Bruno Latour, Hans-Jörg Rheinberger, N. Katherine Hayles, and Friedrich Kittler."
ENGL 90870,"From the earliest moments of European contact, race and Afro-Cubans have played central roles in the history and cultural development of Cuba. Slavery, the struggle for Cuban independence, and the ensuing (perhaps still ongoing) struggle for Afro-Cuban political and social equality have driven Cuban history, while Afro-Cuban cultural expression has become deeply woven into the national social fabric. This course will examine Afro-Cuban history and culture from the last decade of the eighteenth century to the contemporary moment. Divided into three periods, colonial (1791-1895), early republic (1895-1959), and revolutionary (1959-now) the course will address the history, political movements and cultural forms of expression (religion, music, literature, film, etc.) that have helped to create an identifiable Afro-Cuban culture.  So too, the course will examine the tensions between Afro-Cuban culture and mainstream Cuban culture, the ongoing push and pull between the two, and thus the impact of an African presence in the ongoing evolution of cubanidad.  Titles for the course will include Biography of a Runaway Slave, A Black Soldier's Story, Reyita: The Life of a Black Cuban Woman in the Twentieth Century, Afro-Cuban Tales, Man-Making Words, Afro-Cuban Myths, Racial Politics in Post-Revolutionary Cuba and Looking Within/Mirar Adentro."

ESS 20202,"Many have claimed that the American educational system is the great equalizer among men. In other words, the educational system gives everyone a chance to prosper in American society regardless of each person's social origins. In this course, we explore the validity of this claim. Do schools help make American society more equal by reducing the importance of class, race, and gender as sources of inequality, or do schools simply reinforce existing inequalities and reproduce pre-existing social relations? Topics covered include unequal resources among schools, sorting practices of students within schools, parents' roles in determining student outcomes, the role of schooling in determining labor market outcomes for individuals, and the use of educational programs as a remedy for poverty.  This is an education-focused course."
ESS 20203,"The United States is beset by many serious social problems such as educational inequality, extreme poverty alongside unparalleled abundance, crime and deviance, health disparities, mass incarceration, and the persistence of discrimination along lines of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, class, gender, and sexuality. Course materials are designed to engage student learning, illustrate the distinctive features of the sociological perspective, and to start you thinking sociologically about yourself and the broader world. To think sociologically requires you to recognize that our contemporary world, with its enduring cultural, political, and economic institutions, is as much a social product as we are. In this course, students will learn to take a sociological perspective not only in examining the causes, consequences, and solutions to some of society’s most troubling social problems, but also in taking a critical look at their own perceptions of problems."
ESS 20600,"Traditionally, design has been used to connote the process by which the physical artifacts of the objects and communications around us come into being. But over the last decade, design has come more and more to describe not only the development of objects but the process by which one shapes the interactions and experiences of people with the systems, services and organizations around us. A deeply human approach to problem solving, design thinking highlights one's ability to intuitive This course will follow a series of overlapping modules that will introduce the student to the various iterative steps employed in the design thinking process and becoming familiar with the tools and methodologies employed. The course will feature a hybrid seminar format with lectures and case studies followed by hands-on exercises and practical applications of the theories in the form of team projects. At the conclusion of the course, students should be able to articulate the tenets of the design thinking process and apply those methodologies to problems of a variety of disciplines from science and engineering to business and the liberal arts."
ESS 20674,This course offers a comprehensive understanding of digital literacy in relation to teaching and researching language acquisition.

ESS 30134,"This course examines the recent history of the American university. It asks how the last four decades of political-economic restructuring often described as “neoliberalism” – skyrocketing personal debt, privatization of public goods, and more – have reshaped its social function and institutional structure, its labor struggles and relation to local communities. Through readings in critical university studies, ethnic studies, and American literature, we will build a conceptual vocabulary to critically engage these transformations and, in the process, ask fundamental questions about the modern university: what it is, who it is for, and what it might yet be."
ESS 30217,"This course is designed to show students how to interpret and critically evaluate statistics commonly used to describe, predict, and evaluate in the social sciences, as well as many areas of the business and/or medical world. The focus is on a conceptual understanding of what the statistic does, means, and what assumptions are made from it. Hands-on experience in using data analysis is part of the course."

ESS 30414,"Enrolling in school does not guarantee that children acquire the human capital that their schooling should provide. Also, in some countries a large fraction of children still are not finishing primary school, and there are still millions of children who never attend school at all. In this course, we will review the impact of various types of educational interventions on schooling in the Global South. We explore the rationale behind specific policies and the evidence (or lack of) in support of their effectiveness in improving education outcomes. The aim is to engage in broader debates on the challenges facing effective education policy. Students will critically evaluate real-life policy options in different contexts, as well as propose potential innovations. By the end of the course, students will possess an analytical framework that allows them to think clearly about the impacts of alternative education policies, as well as be able to judge the quality of existing evidence."
ESS 30504,"This course combines economic theory and methods to study the production and delivery of education. We will apply economic principles to understand the rationale for particular education approaches, policies, and programs and use an economic lens to explore their potential impact. We will also learn about applying analytic tools to examine the effects of schooling as well as specific education interventions and reforms. Students will read empirical research and will practice being critical consumers of policy arguments and research findings. They will also complete problem sets and writing assignments with the goals of 1) using economic principles to inform policy debates about education investments, 2) employing evidence to evaluate the impact of education policies and programs, and 3) developing skills in conducting original research on education. Substantive topics will span early childhood education, K-12 schooling, and higher education with a focus on the role of incentives, prices, and markets throughout. The course will explore teacher labor markets and teacher effectiveness, school choice, and accountability, and will include discussion of international contexts."
ESS 30605,"This course focuses on selected legal and policy issues related to K-12 education in the United States. A central theme is the intersection of K-12 schooling and the state, with a particular focus on Constitutional issues of religious freedom and establishment, student speech and privacy, parental choice, educational opportunity, and education reform trends such as charter schools and accountability measures.  Questions examined over the course of the semester include:  What are the most basic obligations of the state with regard to its regulation of K-12 education?  What are the most basic rights of parents in this regard?  In what ways does the 1st Amendment protect - and limit - the speech and privacy rights of K-12 schoolchildren?  In what ways may the state accommodate K-12 schools with an explicitly religious character? What are the Constitutional requirements with regard to religious speech or expression within K-12 public schools?  To what degree is the principle of equality manifest in the form of educational opportunity?  How has this changed over time?  In what ways have education reform trends such as charter schooling and increased accountability changed the policy landscape of K-12 education?"
ESS 30614,"Educational Psychology examines questions about development, learning and achievement in schools.  In this course we will explore fundamental questions such as (a) What is intelligence?  Is it fixed or changeable? What are the implications of conceptions of intelligence for achievement? (b) How does learning occur?  What are the implications of different theories of learning?  Is there a correct theory of learning? Does learning differ in different subject areas? (c) What motivates student learning?  Can instruction be motivational?  (d) What is good instruction?  How do theories of learning relate to instructional practices?  (e) How do aspects of school context, such as interaction with peers and teachers, and school culture, influence learning, motivation and achievement?"
ESS 30628,"This seminar explores the intersection of the physical realities of urban environments, race, and education. We will pay particular attention to space as a factor impacting children and families.  As a group, we will work to answer a cluster of questions surrounding the course topic in a systematic, interdisciplinary format. Questions may include: How does the physical landscape/structure of communities and schools matter to urban education? How do high concentrations of poverty and racial segregation impact curriculum, school culture, and neighborhood? How does school choice, early childhood programming, college preparatory and after-school programs factor into the landscape of urban education? What are best practices involved with teaching in urban environments? The final question we will work on as a group will be: What do we know about race and urban landscapes that can help propel positive micro- and macro-level change for our educational system? This course demands a high level of class participation and student initiative."
ESS 30629,"This course covers the various issues relevant to the current early childhood education landscape. This includes theories of early learning and child development, policy development in the United States, the issues of inequality and the achievement gap, and research on interventions or what works in early childhood programming. The advantage to understanding the theories of child development, the policy context and the intervention research is that it gives future teachers and future policymakers a foundational premise upon which to grow, analyze, learn and teach. Topics covered will include: Theories of Child Development (Infant Schools to Present), Head Start and the CCDBG, State Preschool, Inequality and the Achievement Gap in the Early Years and Interventions in Early Childhood (HighScope/Perry Preschool, Abecedarian and Chicago Parent Studies, Head Start Research). The goal of this class is to come away with a greater understanding of the language, the history, the goals and the possibilities in this policy area as well as its connections to other social welfare programs and to K-12 schooling. Students will become more fluent in the language of early childhood education and will gain the foundational knowledge of past and current theories, laws, policies and educational interventions."
ESS 30638,"The title of Duane and Capshaw Smith's book, Who Writes for Black Children? African American Children's Literature Before 1900 captures the essence of this course and serves as our foundation. We will explore the long rich history of literature for African American children by African American authors and challenge deficit, dominant narratives about literacy practices of African American communities before 1900 up to the present day. The majority of the course will focus on literature for children from the 20th century up to recent publications, trends in children's literature that have provided a platform or silenced authors, and how social, cultural, and political factors have controlled whose work is published, which texts are published and distributed, and the impact this has on how individuals and communities view themselves and others. We will draw on a range of literary theories to analyze literature and each student will develop an in-depth author study of an artist of their choice with a strong focus on historical, cultural, and social influences and contexts. Throughout the semester, we will explore the power of literature for disrupting, transforming, and challenging negative and racist ideologies that perpetuate inequality and injustice in American society."
ESS 30640,"The purpose of this course is to provide students with an overview of the origins, concerns, goals, and approaches of education reform past, present, and future. We will explore the breadth of tactics and policy mechanisms employed by reformers, examining the underlying assumptions and theories of action ascribed to each. We will analyze the extent to which various reform efforts have been successful while concurrently defining and redefining the benchmarks for success as we explore questions such as: Who and what are schools for? What should the goals of improvement be? How do we best improve schools and who should decide? What are the origins and implications of differing policy and reform strategies? What assumptions drive different policy levers (i.e. turnaround, incentives, mandates, capacity-building, high-stakes accountability) and how do those in turn shape implementation and outcomes? "
ESS 30641,"Drawing on Lave and Wenger's (1991) theory of legitimate peripheral participation, this Community Based Learning course is structured to allow students to participate in two communities: (1) an elementary classroom during English Language Arts instruction time to both observe the teacher's pedagogy and work directly with children and (2) as a developing literacy researcher with students in the course. Students will learn about research based best practices in literacy instruction during seminars and apply these strategies and approaches in the classroom while working with small groups and individual children. Students will also learn about and apply qualitative approaches to data collection and analysis to study 2-3 children's growth over the semester and to make meaningful and insightful connections between theory and practice. Since the majority of students' time will be dedicated to read-alouds and teaching multicultural children's literature, students will develop an extensive annotated bibliography of children's literature to deepen understanding and appreciation for literature for children. On-Site: Students should plan to spend 3 hours per week at Muessel Elementary School (based on when ELA is taught, typically in the morning, and ND students' schedule). Beginning Week 3, we will only meet on Tuesdays for seminar on campus. Students are responsible for their own transportation."
ESS 30642,"While schools must foster cognitive development and academic achievement, they should also be dedicated to students' mental, emotional, and behavioral growth as well. This course explores holistic education, one that attends to the development of the whole person, as a means for safe, nurturing, and healthy child development. The course considers influences at the student, family, classroom, school, and policy levels. Topics include student/family assets; resources and staffing for student mental health; social and emotional learning; effective school discipline and behavioral interventions; school violence prevention; physical health and academic achievement; and district, state, federal, and faith-based frameworks for supporting mental, emotional, and behavioral health."
ESS 30670,"Students will be introduced to Literatura Infantil y Juvenil (LIJ) in the Spanish-speaking world through a combination of considerable reading of LIJ across genres and levels and a critical perspective of LIJ via academic text and articles. Books read will include many award winners by prolific writers and illustrators of LIJ, as well as widely known writers for adults who have also written children's books. Among genres read will be folklore, narrative, fiction (representing afro-latino, indigenous and other multi-cultural groups; contemporary, realistic, historical), short story, and poetry. In addition, students will develop criteria for evaluating quality LIJ through a variety of interdisciplinary perspectives. Finally, there is a Community-Based Learning (CBL) component where students will share LIJ with the local Latino community through CBL projects and a reading program with Latino youth. Pre-requiste: ROSP 20202 or above or placement by exam. This course can count as an advanced elective towards the major. Taught in Spanish.

ESS 30680,"This course will examine the journey from pre-digital to digital, aka the digital transformation, in higher education. We will be focusing on online learning, the use of artificial intelligence, and XR, and their impact on teaching and learning. Through a series of case studies, readings, and guest speakers, we will explore how higher education institutions approach digital transformation and the opportunities and challenges brought about by new technologies. Students will gain hands-on experience working on projects with higher education professionals responsible for assessing, implementing, and stewarding digital transformations related to teaching and learning at Notre Dame. This course will benefit those interested in learning technologies and organizational evolution related to technology."
ESS 30711,"In June 2020, prompted by the horrific killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, our nation awakened to the brutality of institutional racism and the violence to human dignity it has wrought in communities of color throughout America's history. The movement for racial justice was renewed in vigor with nationwide protests and calls for action. Although the protests of 2020 have largely been a response to a crisis surrounding police violence, the calls to action have focused attention on the breadth of systemic racism in all facets of American life. In this course, students will engage weekly with a single event or concept, drawn from a variety of disciplines, necessary to understand and dismantle systemic racism. The course centers around a weekly guest-lecture series featuring authors, public intellectuals, faith leaders, and external and internal members of the academy. In each class period, the guest expert provides a sophisticated introduction to a discrete racial justice topic. Some lectures address historical events not widely known (e.g., the Tulsa massacre or the arrival of the first slave ship in the Americas in 1619); others address current racial inequities (e.g., the wealth gap, health outcomes, criminal justice, voter suppression); still others examine broad concepts (e.g., intersectionality, Catholic teaching on racism). Specific topics to be determined by expert availability. Students prepare for the sessions by researching the speaker or topic and preparing thoughtful questions to be posed during the guests' visit. Students also participate in at least two small group discussions and, at the conclusion of the semester, are required to produce a short reflective writing piece. The entire course will be offered via zoom for all participants."

Improvement science is explicitly designed to accelerate learning-by-doing. For the practicum aspect of this course, students will work closely with faculty and research mentors involved in our operational programs in the Global South aimed to foster resilience and improve educational and psychological outcomes for children facing adversity (i.e., contexts of deprivation and/or danger). This semester-long practicum will focus on improvement science research and learning agendas in the Global Center for the Development of the Whole Child's (GC-DWC's) operational programs in Haiti and India."
ESS 33523,"This course strives to form a new community of inquiry at the intersection of religion, education, and democracy. It is at such an intersection that the atrophy of each—the central problem to be grappled with in the course—is seen by many to be caused by the values of the other. Are such claims true? Are religion, education, and democracy so incommensurable today that together they can no longer facilitate social coherence, despite the fact that robust educational systems have long bolstered democratic and religious institutions alike? With the discipline of education as its platform and Catholicism, among other religious voices, as its particular conversation partner, the course examines historical, contemporaneous, and ecclesial resources, including Catholic notions of the common good, fraternal humanism, and ecological conversion, to ask, among other questions: What has religion to do with present anti-democratic trends, and what can be done educationally to reverse them? How do we understand education differently when we view it from the perspective of religion, and vice versa? Why is education so prevalent in and fundamental to religion, especially Catholicism, in the United States? As people call for book bans, students will write on how debate, discussion, and dissension are normed and modeled differently by religious and secular philosophies of education. They will also write, assuming a Catholic philosophy of education as normative, on what relationship religion should have with education if the latter is fundamental to democracy while democracy itself serves as the guarantor of religious liberty. The goal of the course is to produce a philosophy of education that engenders in the current generation of students responsibility to the American proposition—to reference the Jesuit John Courtney Murray’s paradigm—and what we can call a religiously-informed, normative vision of the promise of “America” today."

In 2022 the Pope went to Canada and apologized for the role the Church played in the residential boarding schools, and the Subcommittee on Native American issues for the USCCB is investigating the same here in the United States. This course blends primary source historical work with active and engaging projects with Native communities to engage students in both history and historical thought to do consulting and problem-solving that will help shape real policy in the present day!

Using some foundational and contemporary theories in education combined with those with ideas from public pedagogy and cultural studies, the intent of this course is to broaden and complexify our understandings of curriculum and pedagogy; what they are, what they entail, where and by whom they are enacted, and, mostly, what they do in education when conceived in more broader terms.   Using a variety of texts, both in and outside of education, we will explore how pedagogy and curriculum combine with the public to operate, to educate, in spaces like a college campus, a theme park, a museum, a textbook, a classroom, a mall or grocery store, or through popular cultural texts such as film, advertising, social media, and/or newspapers.   Going back and forth between discussions of curricular artifacts and pedagogical understandings in education proper and those public texts noted above, we will examine how curriculum and pedagogy operate in both formal and informal educational settings, what one may learn from the other, and, in the process, re-imagine what these terms could mean in the context of K-12 education."

We will focus on the components that are specific to the task of reading itself, rather than on the more general cognitive, linguistic, or social capacities involved. Drawing from multiple perspectives, students will gain an understanding of how people learn to read, the processes involved in skilled reading, and the causes of reading difficulties.

ESS 41840,"This course is a hands-on opportunity to work with a team on an ongoing digital project -- School Stories, or Schoop-- about people's experiences of being in school, and to amplify the work via social media.  SchoolStories is a crowdsourcing project, seeking stories in various formats, including text, still images, audio, and video. The research team aims to curate a professional, powerful website and to solicit interest from both viewers and contributors, via social media.  The goal of the project is to collect and disseminate personal experiences of people (especially students and teachers) involved in schools at all levels, and internationally. Experience-near accounts of school should always be considered by policy makers and those charged with designing schools, but they are often overlooked in favor of simpler standardized measures. These experiences are affective, bodily, social, economic, medical, and more, not just cognitive--so we need different methods to learn about them.  The course will meet for an hour weekly, and students will be expected to spend another 1-2 hours weekly working on the project, helping to design the weekly or monthly props, to promote interest, and to analyze the results."

EURO 20249,"Eastern Christians and their Churches are an indispensable part of global Christianity that sheds light on its origins, its basic theological tenets, its achievements and its historical failures, dilemmas, and challenges. The course provides an overview of the variety of Eastern-rite Christian Churches belonging to the different cultural traditions of Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. The students will be introduced to the theological views and liturgical life of Eastern-rite Christians, i.e., Orthodox, Oriental, and Eastern Catholic, and their fascinating history. Special attention will be given to the Byzantine tradition, from the medieval period to our day. Russian and Ukrainian religious history and contemporary church life will be explored in more detail: we will focus on the challenges their theology and history present to contemporary world and international relations. Reflections on the diversity of Eastern Christian traditions lead to insights into theological, moral, and cultural issues such as ecumenism and Christian unity, war and peacemaking, Christianity and totalitarianism, the role of liturgy and ritual in modern culture."
EURO 30055,"In this course students will be introduced to the general narrative of the First World War. From there, we will examine three different topics and eventually show how they are interrelated. First, we will study historiography; that is, the evolution of how historians have written about and understood the First World War. Students will quickly learn how historians work with narrative and elements of story-telling both to explain and to argue (with and against one another). Taking the idea of narrative as a point for opening up our understandings of the past, we will then examine works of fiction, memoires, and poetry that focus on the First World War. The Great War was distinguished by being a People's War, which meant that all people of all classes fought side by side, farmers next to scholars, workers next to noblemen. There were thus many men at the front who were capable of recording what they saw and felt in both prose and poetry, leaving an extraordinary and unprecedented literary record of their experiences. Finally, students will study memorialization and public history work on the First World War. We will see how history-writing, literature, art, and memorialization are present in the way museums and memorials tell their own stories about trauma, heroism, social inequality, and - in the main - seek to impart understandings about the past. A trip to memorials and museums in London, Belgium, and France over fall break is an optional component for the course HIST 30055 / GE 33245 in the fall of 2019. The fees associated with travel will be no more than $3000. We are working on funding from various sources to reduce that amount significantly. This course requires an application to enroll. Students interested in the course should submit a paragraph to Professor John Deak, jdeak@nd.edu, stating the reasons for wishing to take the course."
EURO 30102,"This course is tied to the Fall Nanovic Institute Film Series. In this course we’ll focus on four recent films that envision new European realities from very different perspectives. We’ll begin with an introductory lecture in which I'll set up the critical scaffolding for the films in the series by detailing how we can talk about the European art film as something which has defined itself as an alternative to Hollywood filmmaking in terms of stylistic practice, political content, business models, and cultural prestige. The rest of the course will consist of the four film screenings, followed by a discussion after each film.  The films will be introduced by a Nanovic Fellow who specializes in that national culture. After the screenings, that professor and I will serve as co-discussion leaders. At the end of the course, you will be asked to write a short essay (5 pages) in which you compare two of the films according to one of the major issues discussed throughout the course."
EURO 30129,"Ireland’s changing political landscape and evolving sociology, throughout the 1900s and 2000s, tell the story of a country undergoing a turbulent century of conflict and unity, protest and peace, hope for the future while lamenting the past. To understand Ireland’s development more fully then, this course considers the political and sociological, as well as infrastructural and financial factors affecting Ireland as it is increasingly impacted by a changing international context. Two examples include Ireland’s accession and membership of the European Union (EU) and the influx of foreign direct investment (FDI) to the country. The course asks questions such as: to what extent did Ireland’s famous - yet often misinterpreted culture – contribute to facilitating and/or hindering development? To what extent can we attribute Ireland’s rapid economic growth to the “luck of the Irish”? Is this development specific to Ireland or are there lessons to be drawn from the Irish context that can be applied to currently developing nations?"
EURO 30207,"This upper division lecture course examines some of the most important events, ideas, and personalities that shaped late Imperial, Soviet, and early post-Soviet periods of Russian history during the last one hundred years: from the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War and the Revolutions of 1905, WWI, and 1917 through the Great Terror of the 1930s, the experience of the Second World War and the emergence of the Soviet Empire, late Stalinism, the developed or mature socialism, the collapse of the communist regime and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, as well as Russia's uneasy transition out of Totalitarianism and into Putin's authoritarianism. The course is open to all students, including freshmen, with or without background in modern Russian and European history. "
EURO 30241,"England's seventeenth century provides one of the most compelling epochs of human history, full of a cast of remarkable characters. Once Elizabeth I died in 1603, a new dynasty, the Scottish royal house, the Stuarts, came to the throne in the person of James VI and I. A new political dynamic ensued. Insoluble tensions arose between perceived licentiousness in high politics on one hand and puritan moral rigour on the other, between royal control of religion and a hankering after policies based on literal Biblical interpretation and also between a gaping royal treasury and public reluctance to contribute financially to the realm. These, and other factors, resulted in the unthinkable: the dissolution of the ties that had held English politics and society together. The Civil War (or Great Rebellion, or Puritan Revolution depending on the interpretation favoured) that resulted gave rise to a welter of new constitutional ideas, religious experiments and virulent anti-Catholicism. These were all set loose as King and Parliament fought for domination of the country. We will pay particular attention to the figure of Oliver Cromwell, who came to command English politics both before and after the hitherto unimaginable public execution of the king (who many believed was God's anointed). We will also ask why the English after allowing their king to be executed and their toleration a substantial Interregnum subsequently restored Charles II, their erstwhile king's son, as monarch. Remarkable figures that we will encounter and evaluate include the Leveller John Lilburne, the poet John Milton, Praise-God Barebones (yes, that is a name) and the libidinous Samuel Pepys."
EURO 30314,"A cliché, a painful truth, an old story, a new one—this course explores alcohol and alcoholism in Irish literature, Irish society and Irishness, examining how alcohol infuses the stories Irish people tell and those told about them, and asking what happens if we take alcohol(ism) seriously as a framework and topic of analysis. We will think about the romance and conviviality of drink and drinking, pubs and wakes and more; and counterposed crusades against drinking (by Father Mathew and others), as well as the unromantic and destructive dimension so central to recent writing. We will think about alcohol(ism) in relation to political authority and nationalism, as well as in relation to colonial resistance, recalcitrance and recovery. We will ask how this inheritance travels into Irish America, and even to this campus, asking what legacies are being lived out, and why, and what we make of that. The course will feature a diverse set of texts across a span of Irish literary tradition, including medieval and contemporary, fiction and memoir, poetry and prose, verbal, visual and musical media. On the way students will work on their speaking, analytical and writing skills. Course work will include short writing assignments and analytical papers, a presentation, and a creative assignment."
EURO 30350,"The claim that Russians and Ukrainians are one people, “a single whole,” has been resounding in Russian mass media, film, and other discourses for the last two decades. Putin took a pronounced colonial turn with his return to the Presidency in 2012, describing Russia as a state-civilization, in which Russians and Ukrainians are joined in “spiritual unity.” In his long essay on “historical unity,” published in July 2021, Putin argued that Ukraine and Russia were a single country, bound by a shared origin. In this logic, the broken unity must be restored, even if through violence. History thus serves as a justification for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The claim that a nation does not exist is a rhetorical preparation for destroying it. The course will look at historical facts and cultural artifacts of Russia and Ukraine to determine the roots of Russia’s current aggression in Ukraine.   Among others, the course will discuss the following questions. Is Kyivan Rus part of Russian or Ukrainian history, or neither? Does Ukraine have its own history and culture that is distinct from Russian? Was autocracy inherent to the Russian state or were there any democratic alternatives? Are Ukrainians divided into Russian-speakers (aspiring to join Russia) and Ukrainian-speaking nationalists (aspiring to EU)? The course will examine the origins, points of intersection and divergence of Ukrainian and Russian cultures through the lens of history, art, and literature from the Christianization of Rus (10th century) to the present time. We will look at the history of Russian imperialism, centuries of appropriation of Ukrainian cultural achievements, annihilation of Ukrainian traditions, extermination of Ukrainian intellectuals, and the politics of Russification with the purpose to see how the current events reflect a tendency that has already existed for centuries.    The course will look closely into recent history, specifically the annexation of Crimea (2014), a sacred space in Putin’s neo-imperialism, as well as the war in Donbass initiated by Russia yet left largely unnoticed by the Western world since 2014. It is only after the full-scale invasion in February 2022, that the West suddenly became interested in the difference between Russia and Ukraine, or how to pronounce Kyiv. This entrapment in the imperial framework and silencing the war in Eastern Ukraine as a regional conflict allowed Russia to continue with its war crimes today. As a successor of the Soviet State, Russia continues its politics of totalitarianism, expansionism, militarization, repressions, censorship, and propaganda in a renewed form and context. All of what we see in Putin’s Russia today has existed there before. One of the tasks for this course is to identify and analyze the historical precedents in order to define the further trajectories.  "
EURO 30454,"The French Revolution, along with the American Revolution, is often considered the founding moment of modern democracy. And yet, democracy was not achieved once and for all in 1789. Over the course of the next two hundred years, France went through five republics, two empires, two monarchies, and one (arguably) fascist regime. In addition, it took hundreds of years for the egalitarian promises of the revolution to be extended to all members of French society. This course tells the story of this ongoing experiment in democratic governance—one that continues to this day. It introduces students to the major themes in the political and cultural history of modern France from 1789 to the present, examining how the universalist promise of the Republic has been contested and reshaped through its encounter with colonialism, industrialization, the rise of radical ideologies, religion, war, feminism, and multiculturalism. Course materials are drawn from a variety of sources, including novels, manifestos, political cartoons, films, works of art and philosophy, as well as secondary works by historians."
EURO 30985,"As the story often goes, much of human history was consumed by brutal religious conflict. This changed only during the Enlightenment, when Europeans began to embrace the virtue of tolerance, first of other Christians, and then of all religions and none. Though this sweeping narrative does capture a significant shift in the values upheld by the West, it smooths over the practical aspects of religious coexistence. Long before the rise of tolerance, communities have struggled to find ways to live with the religious other in their midst. Moreover, as modern history has proven time and again, even the highest ideals of tolerance do not nullify the friction created by contact between different faiths and creeds.   This course, therefore, considers the long history of toleration, both as it existed prior to the modern era, and how it has changed since the days of Spinoza, Locke, and Voltaire. Though our primary focus will be on Christianity, we will also discuss other models of coexistence practiced in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, as well as how these systems collided in the age of European colonialism. As we approach the present day, we will examine how toleration intersects with issues of racism, secularism, and fundamentalism, and ask whether historical experiences of coexistence have anything to teach us about how to live in peace with neighbors whose beliefs differ from our own."
EURO 33000,"An introduction to Europe and European Studies is frequently done through central spaces (urban centers like Berlin, Paris, and Rome), “central achievements” (Enlightenment,industrialization), or central figures (Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, Immanuel Kant). This course seeks to explore an alternative approach. It proposes to offer an introduction to European Studies through the lens of the concept of peripheries. Even though the term peripheries is contested (because of the condescending center-margin metaphor, the labeling effect, the loaded history of the term, and its implications of “othering”), the reality of power centers and more marginalized spaces cannot be denied. The term “peripheries” has gained new prominence through Pope Francis who has exhorted the faithful to go out to the peripheries. The Nanovic Institute for European Studies has decided to pay special attention to the peripheries in its strategic plan 2021-2026. The Institute has organized research projects on peripheries that will enrich and inform the course. As part of the effort to reflect on decolonizing scholarship the course engages with concepts and dynamics of margins and marginalization and the question of what it means to decenter the center. The course will try to develop an understanding of Europe through rural areas, forgotten traditions, less known persons. It will deal with poverty in Europa, European minorities, and special spaces like borders and outskirts. As a Foundational Seminar in European Studies this course seeks to realize two objectives:  a) to offer an introduction to Europe and European Studies, based on the notions of peripheries and peripheralization. b) to offer a systematic introduction to the (European) discourse on peripheries, margins, and decentering.  The course will work with the literature on peripheries within European Studies and especiallywith a series of case studies where the students are invited to develop their research and writing skills."
EURO 33025,"Fairy tales are a staple of popular culture with roots in the folklore tradition. In this course we will investigate the enduring transnational popularity of the fairy tale and the extent to which they reflect child-rearing, political or social norms across cultures.

EURO 33500,"Was the Soviet Union a workers' paradise or an evil empire? Nearly three decades after this country transformed into what we now call post-Soviet space, the legacy of the USSR looms large in international politics and culture. This course will offer students an introduction to Soviet history through film, which Lenin famously called the most important of the arts, and literature, which Soviet writers used to engineer human souls. Since the 1917 Revolution, art has had a close relationship to the Soviet state. At the same time, writers and filmmakers with individualistic and even rebellious tendencies have created some of the twentieth century's greatest masterpieces, including Dziga Vertov's Man With a Movie Camera and Mikhail Bulgakov's Master and Margarita. In this class we will explore how this tense relationship between art and the state developed in the first half of the twentieth century. Since cultural context is an important lens for our analysis, each artistic work will be accompanied by historical readings about the period in which it was produced, as well as artistic manifestos and contemporary reviews, when relevant. All films will be shown with subtitles and all readings offered in English. Students of the Russian language have the option of discussing the course material in Russian once a week with the instructor in a group for an additional course credit."

EURO 40512,"This course begins in the 1960s, when Italy stood at the center of the film world, and traces the history of Italian cinema to the present day. We will focus on the heyday of Italian auteurs – Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Luchino Visconti, and Pier Paolo Pasolini – examining how each brought a singular vision to the collective medium of cinema. Working against the hegemony of Hollywood, Italian filmmakers in the twentieth century created new forms of representation that inspired audiences worldwide. They continue to do so in the new millennium, building on the innovations of illustrious predecessors like Bertolucci and Pontecorvo, Wertmüller and Cavani to reveal new realities to moviegoers across the globe. We will analyze how questions of class, faith, gender, identity, and ideology intersect on screen as Italian directors seek both to expose and to recreate the illusions by which we live. With a filmography featuring both masterpieces of world cinema and cult classics, this course will investigate how pioneering Italian directors reshaped every genre of film, including action and adventure, comedy, crime, documentary, melodrama, mystery, thriller, horror, and more. The course is taught in English and all films will have English subtitles."

FIN 40470,"In this course, we will critically consider, in light of Catholic Social Teaching, three normative questions regarding the purpose, priorities, and practices of corporations. First, what does the dignity of the human person, as made in the image and likeness of God, mean for people working in business? Second, what do businesses owe to their own workers and the society writ-large, and how do we foster solidarity among those working in business? Third, how can businesses promote authentic human flourishing and integral human development? To answer these questions, we explore certain foundational concepts of Catholic Social Teaching - the dignity of the human person, solidarity and subsidiarity, the virtues of charity and justice, and the common good - and ask how these concepts can be integrated into business practices and corporate governance. To accomplish this end, student wills engage in a close reading of selections from central papal encyclicals on the social question, including Rerum Novarum, Quadragesimo Anno, Laborem Exercens, Centesimus Annus, Caritas in Veritate, and Laudato Si', as well as contemporary scholarship in business ethics that discusses different models of corporate governance."

FTT 30118,"Storytelling allows us to make a place, and a past, come alive, and it is through narrative that certain people, locations, and experiences lodge themselves in our memories.  How, and why, do we reshape our own environment to convey certain stories about our past, our accomplishments, and our collective experiences? Why is it that road-trips loom so large in American cultural memory, and what do they have in common with other placelore stories, such as those featuring Native Americans, Irish saints and TV characters like Northern Ireland's Derry Girls? How can words, sounds and imagery be used to map out and draw us into new and often fantastic virtual geographies?  In this class, we will think about how stories gain power by being anchored in evocative depictions of specific places, both real and imagined. We will examine verbal and visual stories, from medieval manuscripts like the Book of Kells and tales of St. Patrick's travels around Ireland, to contemporary animation (Song of the Sea), murals from Northern Ireland, place-based television series (Derry Girls) and Chicago-based road-trip films (The Blues Brothers, Ferris Bueller's Day Off). We will contemplate how icons of ancient Ireland were used to create new spaces in Chicago, and we'll look at the massive 1893 World's Fair that put a newly rebuilt Chicago on the world map, as well as dramatic histories of Chicago and some of its murderous inhabitants (Devil in the White City). We will also turn to regional storytelling traditions and will study songs and stories about home composed by those who experienced diaspora and migration."
FTT 30140,"The Art of Production Design explores the area of production design and art direction as narrative art forms in cinema and other media. The term “Production Design” and its affiliated disciplines are constantly evolving, but essentially are responsible for creating the atmospheres, settings, and characters which establish a film’s look or “feel”. It can also help with narrative, move the plot, comment on the action, or add symbolic content. Art directors, scenic designers and painters, set decorators, property masters, special effects, costume designers, and hair/make-up personnel are just a few of the many craftspeople that work under the title, “Production Design”. In this course we will examine these areas and the evolution of mise-en-scene. We will explore the many choices with regard to production design through multiple media, (film, tv, theatre, branded content, music video, commercials, and print). Through lectures, screenings, visual presentations, and guest speakers; students will get an in-depth perspective of the overall involvement production design plays in storytelling. Students will also explore their own creative choices through exercises and assigned projects. This may include but is not limited to: architectural, decorative, costume, and cultural research, location scouting, set dressing, lighting design, color theory, graphic design, and photography.  In this course students will be asked to extend their knowledge and experience of the arts while developing their critical and reflective abilities.

This course will undertake an intensive, interdisciplinary focus on the history of video game development, representation in video games, and the languages that digital games work in as well as decolonial theory and diverse theories of design. This class will engage with a variety of scholarly texts, video games, media posts, videos, and design exercises, in order to illustrate the ways in which video games have shaped the ways we play, think, and behave within their spaces. Students will be required to write and design around these lessons and address and push back against the problematic behaviors and colonial narratives around violence, race, gender, sexuality, and relationship to the land that these gamic languages and lessons have created."
FTT 30162,"This course will survey the history of representations of Latinos in American cinema from the silent era to the present. We will examine how stereotypes associated with Latinos have been produced, reinforced, and challenged in American films - from greasers and Latin lovers to gangsters, kingpins, and border crossers. We will explore the fascinating contradiction that, despite a long history of misrepresentation and under representation, Latinos have made significant contributions to Hollywood and independent cinema. We will also examine the rise of Latino directors in recent years and their drive to reframe the Latino image for American audiences. Screenings will range from the silent epic Martyrs of the Alamo (1915) to more recent films such as Maria Full of Grace (2004).

FTT 30455,"This course offers an introductory survey of the primary critical approaches used to analyze television, and thus serves as a foundation for other TV-specific courses within the major.  Through an examination of pioneering and contemporary studies of television, we will explore how television has been analyzed as a communication medium, a technological apparatus, a commercial industry, and a cultural forum, as well as a form of recreation, education, and social bonding.  We will also consider critical approaches that focus on how television shapes our personal identities and values.  While examining methods developed to study TV production, reception, and texts, we will explore such concepts as publicness, liveness, quality, art, and representation.  In addition to discussing how television was analyzed in the past, we will consider how both television and TV studies have changed as a result of globalization, industrial convergence, digital media, and participatory culture."

Students will: Read theories that articulate and advocate each approach; consider the parameters, value, and appeal of that approach, as well as its limitations; practice each approach in written exercises; and research and write a final paper using one or more of these approaches. Students may also use video essays or other media as tools of analysis and critique.    This is a course in academic criticism, not journalistic reviewing. Strong emphasis will be placed on argumentative writing. "
FTT 30461,"Television has been widely available in the United States for only half a century, yet aleady it has become a key means through which we understand our culture.   Our course examines this vital medium from three perspectives.  First, we will look at the industrial, economic and technological forces that have shaped U.S. television since its inception.  These factors help explain how U.S. television adopted the format of advertiser-supported broadcast networks and why this format is changing today.  Second, we will explore television's role in American social and political life: how TV has represented cultural changes in the areas of gender, class, race and ethnicity. Third, we will discuss specific narrative and visual strategies that characterize program formats.    Throughout the semester we will demonstrate how television and U.S. culture mutually influence one another, as television both constructs our view of the world and is affected by social and cultural forces within the U.S. "
FTT 30520,"When war comes, many might imagine that theatre and other forms of performance stop. But, among the many forms of resistance to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there has been a vast increase in the number of new plays representing the suffering and the resilience of the Ukrainian people, many of which have already been translated into English. There has, in contrast, been less attention paid to other forms of performance writing: for example, poetry being created for, or disseminated through, digital media, reaching audiences instantly with all the urgency of the moment. This course has as its central aim the exploration of these materials, both ones already in English translation and ones that might become available. It seeks to understand what has been created and how it is disseminated as cultural practice during the Russian invasion. It will run as a classroom on the Notre Dame campus, meeting simultaneously with one taught in English at the Ukrainian Catholic University, enabling collaboration and shared learning between ND and UCU students."
FTT 30603,"The goal of the course is to compare the processes by which social scientists and filmmakers/photographers engage in social documentation. Students explore how global social problems such as rural and urban poverty, race and gender inequalities, immigration, and violence are analyzed across the social sciences, and depicted in a variety of documentary film and photography genres. The course also explores the role that documentary photography and film play in promoting rights and advocating for social change, particularly in the realm of human rights and global inequality. It examines the history of documentary film and photography in relationship to politics, and to the development of concerns across the social sciences with inequality and social justice. It also looks at how individual documentarians, non-profit organizations and social movements use film and photography to further their goals and causes, and issues of representation their choices raise.  The course is also unique because it requires students to engage in the process of visual documentation themselves by incorporating an activity-based learning component. For their final project, students choose a human rights or social problem that concerns or interests them (and which they can document locally — no travel is required), prepare a documentary exhibit on the chosen topic (10-12 photographs), and write a 12-15 page paper analyzing how 2-3 social scientists construct and frame the given problem. Students also have the option to produce a short documentary film."
FTT 30635,"Long Title: Drunk on Film: The Psychology of Storytelling with Alcohol and Its Effects on Alcohol Consumption.     Alcohol Use Disorder is a chronic relapsing brain disease. But when presented on screen, it's entertainment. Why do we laugh, why do we cry, why do we emulate fictional characters whose drinking habits result in a life of debilitating addiction? From James Bond to Jonah Hill, the psychology and seduction of alcohol on film, television, and online will be analyzed.  Furthermore, what is the relationship between the manner in which alcohol use/abuse is presented on screen and the manner in which alcohol is used and abused on, for example, college campuses? Surveying recent film history, we will examine how alcohol is used in story structure, as a character flaw or strength, and as a narrative device in the story arc of films across multiple film genres, (action/adventure, comedy, romance, etc). Why do characters drink, where do they drink, and how does the result of their getting drunk advance the narrative? We'll also look at non-fiction films that tackle issues of addiction, as a way of comparing character development in Hollywood films to the results of this same behavior in everyday life. Film materials will include weekly screenings outside of class, and academic articles relating to portrayal and analysis of alcohol use in film and television, including the business of marketing alcohol in print and television advertising. From the psychological perspective we will discuss the topic and process of social influence and how the presence of others influences our behavior. Questions of interest will include the following: what are the mechanisms by which group influence unfolds? How and why might we be persuaded? Does the manner, and if so how, in which alcohol use is portrayed in movies and the media reflect the processes and principles of social influence? Readings will include chapters on social influence, persuasion and academic articles evaluating the manner in which alcohol is portrayed and advertised and the effect this has on alcohol consumption. In addition, issues of addiction will be discussed - from understanding the basis of addiction to examining the efficacy of addiction treatment."

FTT 40306,"This is a course on cinema, sovereignty and the resistance to oppression, especially in its visual forms (cinema, media, digital devices...). Dictatorships and other authoritarian regimes need images. They depend to a great degree on stories, legends, slogans and choreographies, on music and spectacles, on what I propose to call sovereign performances that perform sovereignty. Dictators stage their own actions and persona and their public appearances are always carefully organized in order to dominate the audiovisual field. In this context, it is not incidental that the age of cinema is also that of societal control, of the standardization and industrialization of masses, of the most criminal, dictatorial regimes on record that also lead to the industrial violence of repressive strategies. What is the relationship between cinema and power? How do cinematic techniques play a role in resisting, defying and destroying authoritarianism?  This class will, in most parts, consist of seminar discussions (including Canvas discussions and oral presentations) (60%), and lectures (40%)."

FTT 40405,"A film director is first and foremost a visual thinker, who translates a script onto the screen through the language of cinema. In this course, we will learn how to use this language and organize its syntax and grammar to tell a story. We will focus on the meaning of a shot as a singular capsule of cinematic time and space in service of the script. We will learn how to use shot progression in order to build a scene. And we will explore the methods of connecting scenes into a cumulative cinematic experience. This process involves conceptualizing a film from pre-production to post-production from the point of view of a director. Therefore, in addition to theories of directing, this course will include hands-on exercises that focus on preparing a film using various tools like a shotlist, storyboard, floorpan, lined script, visual references, color palettes, and notes for actors. We will learn how to analyze and break down a scene in order to answer the eternal question on every director's mind - how do I know where to put the camera? This course will help you understand your role as a film director and build your confidence at every stage of filmmaking. Filmmaking is a highly industrial process that involves technical expertise in lighting, grip, and camera. However, building on this knowledge, we must understand how to use these technical skills in order to tell an emotional story in any genre. As such, this course will complement the knowledge you will gain in introductory and intermediate filmmaking classes."

We will focus on the heyday of Italian auteurs – Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Luchino Visconti, and Pier Paolo Pasolini – examining how each brought a singular vision to the collective medium of cinema. Working against the hegemony of Hollywood, Italian filmmakers in the twentieth century created new forms of representation that inspired audiences worldwide. They continue to do so in the new millennium, building on the innovations of illustrious predecessors like Bertolucci and Pontecorvo, Wertmüller and Cavani to reveal new realities to moviegoers across the globe. We will analyze how questions of class, faith, gender, identity, and ideology intersect on screen as Italian directors seek both to expose and to recreate the illusions by which we live. With a filmography featuring both masterpieces of world cinema and cult classics, this course will investigate how pioneering Italian directors reshaped every genre of film, including action and adventure, comedy, crime, documentary, melodrama, mystery, thriller, horror, and more.

We shall be looking at examples of films of Shakespeare plays both early and recent, both in English and in other languages, and both ones that stick close to conventional concepts of how to film Shakespeare and adaptations at varying degrees of distance from his language, time, plot, reaching a limit in versions that erase Shakespeare from the film. We will also be looking at the recent phenomenon of Live from broadcasts of live theatre to movie audiences. The transposition of different forms of Shakespearean texts (printed, theatrical, filmic) and the confrontation with the specificities of film production have produced and continue to produce a phenomenon whose cultural meanings will be the subject of our investigations. There will be screenings of the films to be studied in the Browning Cinema."

GE 30008,"Violence and bloodshed have long been central to the modern conception of the middle ages. In recent film and literature, the perceived realism of a given work tends, by and large, to correspond directly with the willingness of the creators to depict brutality. Even in the medievalism of popular fantasy, the depiction of violence in all its varied forms, from the battlefield to the bedchamber, has been justified and excused by claims of representing past realities of common experience. This course will question just how violent the middle ages were, and for whom. More importantly, it will seek to understand how the varied cultures and peoples of medieval Europe conceptualized and understood violence themselves, and what role it played in their lives and imaginations.  In the course of our investigation, we will explore literary narratives of vengeance and crusade and farcical tales of household bloodshed. We will read law codes and sermons attempting to regulate and channel violence. We will read accounts, justifications, and repudiations of torture, execution, and mercy. We will read about peace-making and peace- breaking, and the stories that were told about it. We will question what constitutes violence, and how violence relates to shifting categories of gender, class, and group identity. In all of this, we will seek to identify the differences and similarities between their conceptions of violence and our own can teach us not only about them, but about ourselves."

GE 33245,"In this course students will be introduced to the general narrative of the First World War. From there, we will examine three different topics and eventually show how they are interrelated. First, we will study historiography; that is, the evolution of how historians have written about and understood the First World War. Students will quickly learn how historians work with narrative and elements of story-telling both to explain and to argue (with and against one another). Taking the idea of narrative as a point for opening up our understandings of the past, we will then examine works of fiction, memoires, and poetry that focus on the First World War. The Great War was distinguished by being a People's War, which meant that all people of all classes fought side by side, farmers next to scholars, workers next to noblemen. There were thus many men at the front who were capable of recording what they saw and felt in both prose and poetry, leaving an extraordinary and unprecedented literary record of their experiences. Finally, students will study memorialization and public history work on the First World War. We will see how history-writing, literature, art, and memorialization are present in the way museums and memorials tell their own stories about trauma, heroism, social inequality, and - in the main - seek to impart understandings about the past. A trip to memorials and museums in London, Belgium, and France over fall break is an optional component for the course HIST 30055 / GE 33245 in the fall of 2019.

GH 60711,"In June 2020, prompted by the horrific killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, our nation awakened to the brutality of institutional racism and the violence to human dignity it has wrought in communities of color throughout America's history. The movement for racial justice was renewed in vigor with nationwide protests and calls for action. Although the protests of 2020 have largely been a response to a crisis surrounding police violence, the calls to action have focused attention on the breadth of systemic racism in all facets of American life. In this course, students will engage weekly with a single event or concept, drawn from a variety of disciplines, necessary to understand and dismantle systemic racism. The course centers around a weekly guest-lecture series featuring authors, public intellectuals, faith leaders, and external and internal members of the academy. In each class period, the guest expert provides a sophisticated introduction to a discrete racial justice topic. Some lectures address historical events not widely known (e.g., the Tulsa massacre or the arrival of the first slave ship in the Americas in 1619); others address current racial inequities (e.g., the wealth gap, health outcomes, criminal justice, voter suppression); still others examine broad concepts (e.g., intersectionality, Catholic teaching on racism). Specific topics to be determined by expert availability. Students prepare for the sessions by researching the speaker or topic and preparing thoughtful questions to be posed during the guest?s visit. Students also participate in at least two small group discussions and, at the conclusion of the semester, are required to produce a short reflective writing piece. The entire course will be offered via zoom for all participants."

GLAF 10001,"This course provides an overview of the broad and loosely related field(s) of study and expertise typically clustered under the term global affairs and explores Notre Dame's particular approach to global issues, namely integral human development (IHD). IHD is a conceptual and normative framework for understanding, practicing, and evaluating efforts to reduce poverty, build peace, protect human rights, and address crises caused by food shortages, natural disasters, environmental degradation, and exploitative government or corporate practices and policies. This course examines the provenance, meanings, and resonances of integral human development and comparable concepts in multiple religious as well as secular traditions."
GLAF 10003,"This course aims to provide students with an introduction to statistical methods and their applications to quantitative problems in global affairs.

The course places emphasis on data analysis, data visualization, and interpretation of quantitative results for global policy analysis."
GLAF 20001,"Global Policy and Politics (GPP) helps students gain an understanding of the influences and challenges officials face during the foreign policymaking process. The course begins by investigating how people's choices are shaped by cognitive, cultural, normative and decision-making structures. The second section of the course examines how a state's attributes (i.e., size, regime type, and internal cohesion) produce different types of constraints on policymakers. The third portion looks at the most important actors in the foreign policymaking process in the United States, including the president, intelligence, the Congress, media, NGOs, international institutions, foreign governments, and lobbyists. In the fourth segment we examine policymaking in a half-dozen countries. Using a comparative approach, we identify the characteristics of each county and study their real-world effects on its foreign policies. The final is an experiential learning simulation in which students apply their skills and knowledge to a crisis situation based on actual events. In addition to studying policymaking, students will also learn how to consume, digest, and organize complex ideas and information across multiple related topics and explain them in a coherent manner. The course both enhances students' knowledge of how foreign policy is made and teaches them the reading, writing and oral communications skills they will need to support, and one day become, a policymaker. This includes producing both written and oral policy briefings as well as collaborative experiential policymaking exercises. The ability to find the logical linkages among arguments and synthesize and present their similarities and differences in concise and informative written and spoken briefings is a highly marketable skill. Multinational corporations, governments, think-tanks, NGOs and international organizations are all seeking people who are able to weigh different policy options and communicate complex analytical ideas to both superiors and subordinates."

Principles of Economics covers topics such as scarcity, demand and supply, elasticity, consumer choice, competition, monopoly, labor markets, poverty and inequality, financial markets, GDP and economic growth, unemployment, money and inflation, monetary policy and exchange rates, and government policy."
GLAF 20102,"Science and technology play a powerful role in structuring our world, in everything from our physical environment to our culture. It is thus imperative that we understand how these entities work. What constitutes reliable knowledge? How do the technological systems in which we are embedded throughout our lives come to be, and how can they be changed? In this historic moment of a global pandemic playing out against a backdrop of fake news, alternative facts and increasingly autonomous technologies, these questions are more critical than ever. This course introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of Science and Technology Studies in order to provide them with analytical and conceptual tools needed to confront the complex questions that arise where science and society intersect. Its objective is thus not so much to present a particular body of empirical information as it is to equip students with the analytical skills to understand complex multi-dimensional phenomena. The purpose is to give students both the opportunity and the tools to consider science and technology in a broader political, social, historical and economic context, and to reflect on how the practices of scientific and technological development shape their own individual and collective experience."
GLAF 20103,"This course introduces students to the field of social-cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropologists are primarily interested in exploring issues of human cultural diversity across cultures and through time. This course will explore key theoretical, topical, and ethical issues of interest to cultural anthropologists. We will examine diverse ways in which people around the globe have constructed social organizations (such as kinship, and political and economic systems) and cultural identities (such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, race, and class) and we will consider the impact of increasing globalization on such processes. Throughout the course we will consider how different anthropologists go about their work as they engage in research and as they represent others through the writing of ethnographies."
GLAF 20104,"LifeDesign: The Art and Science of Human Flourishing is organized around a series of questions: How might we develop mindsets, skillsets, and habits to foster a more joyful, purposeful life? How do these ideas relate to creating a flourishing life, one filled with deep satisfaction, well-being, and resilience? What is a motivating question in one's own life that is worth exploring over the semester? What can we learn from science, the humanities, and global experiences about the varieties of human flourishing?  How do explorations of one's own flourishing connect with larger questions of promoting human flourishing in a global context? This course assists students in exploring and finding their own answers to these questions so that they can build a sustainable foundation for flourishing during their undergraduate years and beyond in their personal, civic, spiritual, and professional life, especially in an increasingly complex global context. "
GLAF 20105,"Understanding religious communities and their values are crucial to understanding human societies and global affairs. One particular group of interpreters of Islam, namely the traditional or orthodox religious scholars called the ulama and their institutions, are often hidden from contemporary accounts of Islam when in fact they are critical players. This course will provide historical contexts in order to explore how traditional Muslims navigate the discourses of modernity and how they resist it. We will read original texts in translation and secondary sources of descriptions of representatives of the orthodox tradition in regions of Asia, the Middle East and in the West. The course will pay particular attention to the institutions of learning known as madrasas, jami` and hawzas. Of course, the orthodox views are challenged by other Muslims and some of those debates will also be channeled in the class while the focus will remain on the Ulama. The course aims to equip students with analytical skills and the resources to understand how religious ideas impact religious communities and global affairs."
GLAF 20106,"An introduction to the field of international development, with particular focus on the various disciplines that have contributed to and shaped the development discourse. Readings, lectures, and discussions will draw from various disciplines, including economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, environmental and technological sciences, public health, law, and gender studies, among others. We will examine debates on the meaning and measurement of development; alternative approaches to, and methods in, the study of development; and attempts to address some of the main development challenges facing the world today. There will be a central focus on understanding what works in development. Working together in teams, students will conceptualize and design an international development project using real world constraints."
GLAF 20107,"Armed conflict and state repression continue to occur across the globe, millions of people face overwhelming poverty, and systemic challenges like climate change imperil collective survival. Nevertheless, we have also witnessed the emergence of sophisticated civil society networks and social movements to address these challenges, as well as governmental and transnational institutions committed to promoting justice and peace at the local, national, regional and global levels. This course introduces students to the various ways scholars and activists define peace and the challenges faced in securing peace. It surveys: (1) the major causes of direct and structural violence; (2) various definitions of peace and the conditions under which it occurs and is sustained; and (3) the comparative success of various strategies such as building peace movements and promoting nonviolent social change."
GLAF 20108,"This course is an introduction to the history of the peoples of Africa from the late nineteenth century to the present day. During the term, we will consider the ways in which Africans shaped and were shaped by the transformative events of the period. In the second half of the nineteenth century, European powers conquered and colonized much of the continent. Over the next sixty years, Africans lived and died under the yoke of European rule; some resisted, others collaborated, but all influenced the nature of colonialism and its eventual collapse. By the 1960s, most Africans were free of foreign rule. Since then the peoples of Africa have endeavored to achieve political stability, navigate Cold War politics, harness development aid, and adapt to a globalizing economy. In recent years, they have succumbed to brutal wars and endured devastating famines, but they have also inspired the world with their triumph over apartheid, emerging vibrant democracies, rich cultures, and deep history. In this class, we will identify, problematize, and debate these major themes in Modern African history. We also will make use of a variety of texts, from historical documents to classic academic works to works of African art, film, and fiction."
GLAF 30100,"The goal of the course is to compare the processes by which social scientists and filmmakers/photographers engage in social documentation. Students explore how global social problems such as rural and urban poverty, race and gender inequalities, immigration, and violence are analyzed across the social sciences and depicted in a variety of documentary film and photography genres. The course also explores the role that documentary photography and film play in promoting rights and advocating for social change, particularly in the realm of human rights and global inequality. It examines the history of documentary film and photography in relationship to politics and the development of concerns across the social sciences with inequality and social justice. It also looks at how individual documentarians, non-profit organizations, and social movements use film and photography to further their goals and causes as well as issues of representation their choices raise. The course is unique because it requires students to engage in the process of visual documentation themselves by incorporating an activity-based learning component. For their final project, students choose a human rights or social problem that concerns or interests them (and which they can document locally - no travel is required), prepare a documentary exhibit on the chosen topic (10-12 photographs), and write an essay analyzing how social scientists construct and frame the given problem. Students also have the option to produce a short documentary film."
GLAF 30102,"This course examines the late 20th and early 21st century economic miracles of several East Asian countries. We will explore similarities, differences, and interdependencies in the development trajectories of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and mainland China, and will debate how accurate and useful concepts like the developmental state and state capitalism are in describing the political economy of the region. To what extent has China's economic rise followed the playbooks of its East Asian neighbors? What human costs and developmental distortions have accompanied booming industrial and urban growth? And what lessons does East Asia's experience offer for the contemporary developing world?"
GLAF 30104,"The difference between rich and poor nations is not, as Ernest Hemingway once said, that the rich have more money than the poor, but is in part because the rich produce more goods and services. Industrialization, in other words, has often brought wealth (as well as social dislocation and protest) to those who have succeeded. This course examines the process of industrialization from a comparative perspective and integrates the history of industrialization and its social consequences for Western Europe (Britain and Germany), the United States, Latin America (Mexico), and East Asia (Japan and South Korea). We will concentrate on these countries' transition from agriculture-based societies to industrial societies. We will analyze the process of industrialization on two levels from above the role of political authority and from below a view of factory life, industrial relations, and protest from the perspective of workers and the working classes. No specific prerequisites in history or economics are necessary."
GLAF 30105,"While there is a wealth of academic work on race, racism, and anti-racism in the domestic realm, there is less attention to them in the international context. This is unfortunate, because they cannot be domestically confined. United Nations resolutions against racism, debates about whether the International Criminal Court is racially biased, and the global wave of anti-racist protests in 2020 are a few examples. This course examines race in the international context, exploring how it affects, is affected by, and is intertwined with central topics in international relations, including human rights, war and peace, foreign policy, international law and international organizations. "
GLAF 30110,"Do you want to learn how to solve problems that matter? Human Centered Design (HCD) is an empathetic tool that utilizes guided questioning related to product, service, or systems innovations to identify opportunities for sustainable, human-centered impact. For example, how might we design a cookstove that reduces the amount of smoke inhaled by a community member? How might we design a new service engaging low-income borrowers in rural communities? How might we design a system linking social innovators and their innovations to users across the globe in a manner that encourages collaboration and sharing of resources? Whether a social innovator is designing in the private, public or nonprofit sector, HCD provides a valuable framework, deeply rooted in empathy, and is an excellent methodology for social innovators who want to problem solve and design alongside communities. In this course students will be introduced to the HCD toolkit and will apply it in practice, either in a domestic or international context. This fast-paced course will take students through the HCD cycles of inspiration, ideation and implementation, and provide opportunities for student and community collaboration."
GLAF 30112,"The course adopts an entrepreneurial perspective in exploring the role of business in helping to address the poverty challenge in developing and developed economies. The multi-faceted nature of poverty and its implications when it comes to business and entrepreneurship are explored. Attention is devoted to venture creation as a pathway out of poverty, and to how the larger business community can be leveraged in poverty alleviation efforts. Students will examine case studies and meet low income entrepreneurs."
GLAF 30113,"Social Entrepreneurship has sparked dialogue and debate for two decades. Its very definition is much debated, as well as its capacity to create sustainable, scalable, systems-changing impact. This course explores the theoretical concepts, practices and strategies associated with the dynamic discipline of social enterprise and innovation. For our purposes, social entrepreneurship is the landscape, of which paradigm-shifting solutions like microfinance, MSME (Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise) development, bottom of the pyramid, fair trade, impact investing, and the like, are components. This course will study many of these concepts, focusing on their opportunity for social impact, and as a vehicle for wealth creation in vulnerable and disenfranchised communities across the globe. Further, the course covers examples of various social enterprise models (for-profit, non-profit, hybrid), requiring students to analyze and devise strategies to improve the efficacy of these ventures. Finally, the course engages students in research seeking to advance the field of social entrepreneurship at the Keough School of Global Affairs and Notre Dame."
GLAF 30114,"What role does international law have in the advancement of human rights, and how does human rights, in turn, advance international law? This course introduces university students to the general system of modern international law (e.g. its norm-generating framework involving States and non-State actors; the roles of many State and non-State authoritative decision-makers in shaping expectations of peaceful, just, and responsible behavior in the international system; its varied constellation of dispute settlement courts and tribunals, alongside the prospects and limits of enforcing State compliance with international decisions), specifically viewed from the lens of historic global, regional, and domestic challenges to human dignity that influenced the first global codification of human rights norms under the United Nations' 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, up to the present development of the current international system of protection for human rights. The course situates the framework of modern international law and civil, political, economic, social, and cultural human rights, using five examples of the historic, defining, and 'constitutionalizing moments' for the international system: 1) the international abolition of slavery; 2) the evolution from classical to modern international law in dismantling colonial empires to enshrine the self-determination of all peoples and the equality of sovereignty of all nations; 3) the outlawing of the aggressive use of force since 1929, towards the peaceful settlement of maritime and territorial disputes and the humanitarian rules applicable to armed conflict situations; 4) the establishment of international accountability of individuals and States for genocide, crimes against humanity and other human rights atrocities; and 5) the global regulation for sustainable use, shared protection, and intergenerational responsibility over natural resources (land, oceans, atmosphere, outer space)."
GLAF 30115,"In June 2020, prompted by the horrific killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, our nation awakened to the brutality of institutional racism and the violence to human dignity it has wrought in communities of color throughout America's history. The movement for racial justice was renewed in vigor with nationwide protests and calls for action. Although the protests of 2020 have largely been a response to a crisis surrounding police violence, the calls to action have focused attention on the breadth of systemic racism in all facets of American life. In this course, students will engage weekly with a single event or concept, drawn from a variety of disciplines, necessary to understand and dismantle systemic racism. The course centers around a weekly guest-lecture series featuring authors, public intellectuals, faith leaders, and external and internal members of the academy. In each class period, the guest expert provides a sophisticated introduction to a discrete racial justice topic. Some lectures address historical events not widely known (e.g., the Tulsa massacre or the arrival of the first slave ship in the Americas in 1619); others address current racial inequities (e.g., the wealth gap, health outcomes, criminal justice, voter suppression); still others examine broad concepts (e.g., intersectionality, Catholic teaching on racism). Specific topics to be determined by expert availability. Students prepare for the sessions by researching the speaker or topic and preparing thoughtful questions to be posed during the guest's visit. Students also participate in at least two small group discussions and, at the conclusion of the semester, are required to produce a short reflective writing piece. The entire course will be offered via zoom for all participants."
GLAF 30128,"Market-oriented reforms known as ‘neoliberalism’ have dominated the reform agenda across the world. These reforms were passed amidst tremendous political contestations and have delivered varying degrees of success. For the developing countries that faced the additional/simultaneous challenges of building ‘good’ institutions and governance systems, these reforms have resulted in questionable outcomes. Given this, today’s emerging economies have been forced to re-assess the benefits of market-oriented reforms, and those with policy space and political will/capacity have embarked on new reform experiments. The module introduces the students to the complexities and challenges of economic reforms in the fast-growing economies by placing politics at the heart of the analysis. The course is comprised of two parts. The first part provides the theoretical and conceptual foundations for examining the processes and outcomes of economic reforms. It discusses the limitations and dangers of designing and implementing reforms without consideration of the broader concept of states and markets or sufficient engagement with politics. This is because policy always produces new winners and losers, and as a result provokes resistance from those who believe they will lose wealth, status, or power. The second part investigates reforms in key areas of the political economy where there have been significant reforms and where distributive tension and conflicts are rampant. These include privatization, trade liberalization, industrial policies, debt and macroeconomic stabilization, tax and fiscal, and social policy reforms, food and nutrition, among others. Given the importance of national and regional contexts when discussing politics, the course draws cases from a wide range of geographical areas including East Asia, Latin American and Sub-Saharan Africa. The module concludes by examining the implications of factoring politics and local contexts into economic reforms for development policy and management and discusses whether new development paradigms and models exist for emerging economies."
GLAF 30129,"Ireland’s changing political landscape and evolving sociology, throughout the 1900s and 2000s, tell the story of a country undergoing a turbulent century of conflict and unity, protest and peace, hope for the future while lamenting the past. To understand Ireland’s development more fully then, this course considers the political and sociological, as well as infrastructural and financial factors affecting Ireland as it is increasingly impacted by a changing international context. Two examples include Ireland’s accession and membership of the European Union (EU) and the influx of foreign direct investment (FDI) to the country. The course asks questions such as: to what extent did Ireland’s famous - yet often misinterpreted culture – contribute to facilitating and/or hindering development?  To what extent can we attribute Ireland’s rapid economic growth to the “luck of the Irish”? Is this development specific to Ireland or are there lessons to be drawn from the Irish context that can be applied to currently developing nations?"
GLAF 30131,"“Energy Systems for Decarbonization” is a lecture-based class primarily targeted at undergraduates. It is designed to introduce you to our energy system as it currently exists, then to the work we have ahead of us to transform it for justice and decarbonization to address climate change and other issues. Energy systems are crucial drivers of both social and environmental outcomes. Structural transformation of both supply and demand side energy systems is necessary for climate change mitigation, with a number of other major implications that will vary based on the transition approach. Transforming these systems in a way that centers justice and human dignity is possible, but not guaranteed. This course will cover both supply and demand-side energy systems, including fossil, nuclear, and renewable fuels, and buildings, transportation, industry, and infrastructure energy uses, with an emphasis on what exists today and what would need to happen for decarbonization to proceed. The course will also address policy and emphasize cobenefits and disbenefits of specific paths forward, for US and international contexts."
GLAF 30132,This course provides an introduction to mixed methods research in global affairs and prepares undergraduate students to design and conduct independent research. Students will learn how rigorous qualitative and quantitative information can be integrated to answer complex research questions. It will also strengthen student's ability to be informed consumers of research presented in academic publications and the media.
GLAF 30133,"This course is designed to introduce students to a wide range of health issues affecting women globally, with particular emphasis on Africa, Asia, and the United States. The topics will focus on a woman's life, from infancy and childhood, through adolescence and reproductive years, to old age. We will examine the physiological, social, psychological, economic, cultural, political, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence women's health, and the role of poverty, discrimination, and unequal health access. Topics such as determinants of women's health, reproductive health, sexual health, cardiovascular health, maternal health, cancers of the reproductive tract, mental and emotional health, substance use and abuse, and various forms of violence against women will be discussed. At the end of the course, students should have a solid grasp of key issues affecting the health of women in different cultural contexts globally, and how women can be empowered to take actions that positively influence their health."
GLAF 30135,"This seminar will provide an overview of and framework to understand the global refugee crisis. We will trace the evolution of international refugee law and policy dealing with this ever-growing population. Central are the ethical challenges that refugees pose for the international community. What is the nature of our collective obligation to refugees? What determines the extent of this obligation? Through a series of legal and sociological case studies, students will also grapple with the social, legal , political and ethical challenges posed by humanitarian intervention on behalf of refugees and the often unintended consequences of such policies. How do the different models for dealing with refugee resettlement affect the life chances of refugees? This project-based course will pair students with a refugee community to address a pressing social concern."
GLAF 30136,"How has the Internet changed the ways people voice their opinions, gather information, and organize social movements? Have marginalized groups become more empowered by mobilizing online? Why does increased social media activity often exacerbate political polarization and populism? How has social media affected national elections? This course will analyze these questions and more within the context of East Asia. In analyzing the impact of the Internet on state-society relations, students will analyze state attempts to control media consumption and surveil Internet-use in Communist regimes like North Korea and China. We will compare these trends with similar efforts made by state actors in advanced industrialized countries such as Japan and South Korea. While the Internet-usage is in many ways, still tightly regulated by the state, the Web has in many ways, also empowered people formerly detached from politics to become politically engaged. This has led to both political polarization (and the influx of political extremist groups), as well as large-scale grassroots movements for democratization. Along these lines, we will examine the growth of far-right netizen groups in Japan, South Korea, and China and the subsequent proliferation of hate crimes, populism, and ultra-nationalism. We will also read studies of how teenagers used their presence on social media and the blogosphere to eventually lead large-scaled national protests like the 2016 Candlelight Movement in Seoul and the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. Finally, in studying the global diffusion of social protests in the digital age, we will analyze how the #MeToo movement reignited new waves of feminism in South Korea, Japan, and China. What implications does the Internet have for the future democracy?"
GLAF 30137,"This course examines the most important bilateral relationship in the world today. It begins with an overview of the major historic episodes in U.S.-China relations, then, adopting a theme-based approach, it examines the relationship among important topics in the contemporary bilateral relationship across the overlapping political, economic and security spheres. The course will stress the importance of perceptions in policymaking, and use student presentations and a crisis simulation to allow students to understand the problem from various perspectives."
GLAF 30138,"Enrolling in school does not guarantee that children acquire the human capital that their schooling should provide. Also, in some countries a large fraction of children still are not finishing primary school, and there are still millions of children who never attend school at all. In this course, we will review the impact of various types of educational interventions on schooling in the Global South. We explore the rationale behind specific policies and the evidence (or lack of) in support of their effectiveness in improving education outcomes. The aim is to engage in broader debates on the challenges facing effective education policy. Students will critically evaluate real-life policy options in different contexts, as well as propose potential innovations. By the end of the course, students will possess an analytical framework that allows them to think clearly about the impacts of alternative education policies, as well as be able to judge the quality of existing evidence."
GLAF 30139,"The claim that Russians and Ukrainians are one people, “a single whole,” has been resounding in Russian mass media, film, and other discourses for the last two decades. Putin took a pronounced colonial turn with his return to the Presidency in 2012, describing Russia as a state-civilization, in which Russians and Ukrainians are joined in “spiritual unity.” History thus serves as a justification for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This course will look at historical facts and cultural artifacts of Russia and Ukraine to determine the roots of Russia’s current aggression in Ukraine. Among others, the course will discuss the following questions. Is Kyivan Rus part of Russian or Ukrainian history, or neither? Does Ukraine have its own history and culture that is distinct from Russian? Are Ukrainians divided into Russian-speakers (aspiring to join Russia) and Ukrainian-speaking nationalists (aspiring to EU)? The course will examine the origins, points of intersection and divergence of Ukrainian and Russian cultures through the lens of history, art, and literature from the Christianization of Rus (10th century) to the present time. We will look at the history of Russian imperialism, centuries of appropriation of Ukrainian cultural achievements, annihilation of Ukrainian traditions, extermination of Ukrainian intellectuals, and the politics of Russification with the purpose to see how the current events reflect a tendency that has already existed for centuries."
GLAF 30605,"This course examines US engagement in hotspots across the Muslim world before and after 9/11. In particular focus are nations in South Asia and the Middle East: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq. We will also look at US relations with important Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, as well as policies toward Israel-Palestine and the Bosnian War in Europe. US engagement abroad takes many forms, including public diplomacy, trade, sanctions, alliances, covert operations, financial and military aid, and direct military intervention. What are the drivers of American decision-making in the region? Why is there so much anti-American sentiment in Muslim societies? Does peace depend on a critical reassessment of US foreign policy or the reform of a radical Islamist theology? Do certain interpretations of religion make conflict inevitable, or is it possible to attain reasonable outcomes even when dealing with extremists? Through a blend of history, investigative journalism, case studies, opinion polls, literature, and film, this course broadens our perspectives on some of America's longest wars in the Muslim world."
GLAF 30901,"This course explores the myriad of national security policy challenges facing the United States and the policy options to address these challenges. The course will explore security issues with Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as well as climate change, global health/pandemics, cyber threats/security and terrorism/extremism. The course will include lectures by policy experts and student engagement with these experts to explore policy options and their potential for success. Students will conduct research of primary source policy documents to develop a policy memorandum for the US National Security Council that will outline a policy challenge for the United States and recommend policy options for consideration."
GLAF 30902,"This course will examine the compounding challenges and injustices affecting the most fragile countries in the world, including extreme poverty, forced migration, climate change, violent conflict, economic collapse, and corruption. Students will analyze diplomatic, development and national security policies of the United States to respond. One specific policy students will study is the Global Fragility Act of 2019 now being implemented by the Department of State and other federal agencies. In addition, the curriculum will incorporate the foreign policy priorities of the newly formed 117th Congress and the White House, as either the 2nd term of President Trump or the new Biden Administration roll out its goals for the next four years. Students will navigate the legal, political and media contexts in which policies to address global fragility are shaped; analyze the policymaking process within the U.S.; and employ strategies for communicating about policy. Understanding the role of evidence-based research to influence interagency policy will be a primary focus. In this regard, students will sharpen their ability to analyze primary source policy documents and formulate key questions at the center of global policy development. They will grapple with existing and proposed laws, evaluate current policy debates, and produce policy materials. This course is not a lecture class. It will be interactive, include instruction based on current and historical policy initiatives, and welcome guest speakers who are current or former practitioners in US government agencies, international humanitarian organizations, multilateral organizations, or policy think tanks."

Throughout the course of the semester, students will compose a variety of short papers, lead classroom discussions, and complete a final project incorporating independent research on related topics."
GLAF 33101,"This course is taught jointly by a group of Asia experts from different departments of the University. It provides students with a unique introduction to Asia in all its diversity, ranging from its languages, cultures, and histories to its political and economic systems and its relations with the US. As the global balance of power is shifting towards Asia, it is more important than ever for Notre Dame students to have more than just basic knowledge about the continent. This course provides just that: an opportunity to take your understanding of Asia beyond the level of what you read in the newspapers, providing you with the tools to formulate your own critical understanding of the region and its global environment.  Classroom sessions will be structured around a set of common assumptions about Asia as a whole or about specific Asian countries. Through reading, discussion, and lectures by members of the teaching team, students will be encouraged to reflect critically on those assumptions and consider a range of alternative interpretations. As much as possible, professors will assign some of their own work as readings for the course and introduce their own perspectives as gained from their research practice. For their writing assignments, students will be asked to make connections between the topics of different lectures and, as much as possible, to think comparatively about different parts of Asia."
GLAF 40100,"Students, in a structured format, are involved in assessing, prioritizing and creatively solving problems encountered by low-income and other disadvantaged South Bend entrepreneurs. A process consulting approach is employed and a number of useful tools and frameworks are introduced. Students work with both for-profit and non-profit enterprises, producing tangible deliverables that help clients launch, grow and sustain their ventures. In addition to class time, students will meet with clients on a weekly basis at a Notre Dame facility located downtown. Assistance with transportation will be available for students needing it. Class will meet on Tuesdays. On Thursdays, students will consult with local entrepreneurs in one hour blocks during the hours of 5p to 9p at the Center for Civic Innovation. This consulting time is flexible with students' schedules and based on appointments made by local entrepreneurs."
GLAF 40107,"What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films. Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba)."
GLAF 40112,"Could business be an instrument of peace or is it more likely to be an agent of division that foments conflict? While the course will touch on questions of whether trade and economic development as well as different economic systems impact causes of violence, the class focuses specifically on the role of for-profit and non-profit institutions within the context of current economic systems. This course draws upon three perspectives to undertake a 360-degree assessment of this question about business's role. First, it will examine the ways in which the actions of business exploit populations, profit from war-making, and sometimes actively engage in the promotion of violence. Second, it looks at an area of academic inquiry sometimes called Business For Peace, in which the ways in which businesses can be instruments of peace have been explored. The ways businesses might do this include being more actively involved in peacemaking and peacekeeping in zones of conflict as well as more general, incremental forms of peace building that could occur both in and outside of zones of conflict. Third, the course looks at newer, nuanced theories from political theorists that assess the positives and negatives of the role of business in engagement in peace."
GLAF 46000,"Directed Readings in Global Affairs are courses in which students meet with a faculty member to discuss, analyze, and interpret a set of agreed-upon texts in a given field of study. The proposed course or study may not duplicate or reflect content or regularly offered courses, and the work should reflect the intellectual challenge, intensity, and time commitment reflected in the number of credit hours awarded. The Keough School will normally limit to two the number of Directed Readings that may fulfill the requirements of its degree program, and students pursuing Directed Readings should have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in their major. A formal application is required, which must include a syllabus and justification statement. Students should have a clear topic they want to pursue and have identified and spoken with a faculty member before requesting a copy of the application form from the Keough School Dean's Office."
GRED 60680,"This course will examine the journey from pre-digital to digital, aka the “digital transformation”, in higher education. Focusing on online learning, the use of artificial intelligence, and XR, we will explore their impact on teaching and learning. Through a series of case studies, readings, and guest speakers, we will explore how higher education institutions approach digital transformation and the opportunities and challenges brought about by new technologies. Students will gain hands-on experience working on projects with higher education professionals responsible for assessing, implementing, and stewarding digital transformations related to teaching and learning at Notre Dame. This course will benefit those interested in learning technologies and organizational evolution related to technology."

For each of its three years, this project recruits a cohort of 9-12 doctoral students, postdocs, and law students to work in small interdisciplinary teams of 3-4 spanning the natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, humanities and law. In the first half of each year, fellows undergo training in Technology Ethics, Responsible Innovation (RI) and the IDEA Center's Commercialization Engine process. In the second half of each year, fellows will be connected to a real-world commercialization project through Notre Dame's technology transfer and incubation hub, the IDEA Center."
GSC 10001,"This course provides students with an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of gender studies. It also serves as an introduction to gender itself—gender as identity, as a social/cultural formation, as a mode of self-expression, and as a critical lens through which to better understand the world. We will explore how gender is experienced, produced, and performed at the intersection of culture, politics, and the body, always in conjunction with other factors of power and difference such as race, nation, sexuality, dis/ability, and socioeconomic class. We will ask how institutions like government, work, and family interact with gender in the U.S. and in local contexts around the world. We will think critically about how ideology (systems of ideas and knowledge) and representation (portrayals in media, political discourse, and everyday life) shape our understanding of gender. The study of gender reaches into, across, and beyond academic disciplines. This course will explore how research on gender is done both within the interdisciplinary field of gender/women/sexuality studies and across many other fields, taking up debates and conversations about gender from history, sociology, anthropology, biology, literature, philosophy, political science, geography, and other disciplines that engage gender as a subject of knowledge."
GSC 13181,"An introduction to the seminar method of instruction, grounded in the interdisciplinary field of gender studies, with a particular focus on the study of gender and sexuality in the social sciences. This course will develop writing skills among first-year students while introducing them to some central problems and issues within gender studies. Each seminar focuses on a particular social topic and includes readings from across social scientific disciplines -- including sociology, anthropology, geography, psychology, and political science -- as well as interdisciplinary gender studies scholarship that is in conversation with those fields. For a full description of this section of the course, please see the enhanced course information."
GSC 20101,"Welcome to Global Africa. This course is an introduction to the history of the peoples of Africa from the late nineteenth century to the present day. We investigate the ways in which Africans shaped and were shaped by the transformative events of the period. At the turn of the twentieth century, European powers conquered and colonized much of the continent. Over the next sixty years, Africans lived and died under the yoke of European rule. They resisted and collaborated, rendering uncertain the power of colonialism and certain its ultimate collapse. By the 1960s, most Africans were free of foreign rule. Since then they of have endeavored to achieve political stability, navigate  Cold  War  politics,  harness  development  aid,  and  adapt to an emerging neoliberal economic order. In recent years, while some have ignited brutal wars and  endured devastating  famines,  they  have  also  inspired  the  world  with  their triumph  over  apartheid, emergent,  vibrant  democracies,  and  rich  cultures.  Together,  we will explore these dramatic moments  as  well  as  the  complex  and  painful  forms  of inequality that lay beneath - whether racial, gendered, sexual, or economic. We will approach these unsettling issues with respect for another and the past. To do so, we analyze a variety of texts from primary documents, fiction written by Africans, film, and graphic novels. We will also train ourselves to be historians of Africa, researching the lives and labors of everyday African peoples and using historical writing to understand their influence over the past and present."
GSC 20429,"An examination of the role and representation of women in Christian texts and practices from the biblical period, through late antiquity and the middle ages, into the present. This course employs a variety of methods (theological, historical, socio-cultural, art historical) to explore diverse histories of women, such as female biblical figures, late antique women martyrs and monastics, medieval mystics, female saints, and the modern and contemporary lives of women. A special focus for Fall 2022 will be the intersection of women's bodies and the liturgical-ritual life of the Church through a global lens, including the experiences of women in the Christian East and Africa."
GSC 20466,"The family is the most fundamental institution of all known societies, and the study of families is a core area of sociological inquiry. The word family is one that is pervasive in society, but it can have multiple meanings in various contexts, and it is a more difficult concept to define than we may initially think. What family means changes over time and varies across cultures, and there is much continual debate about what a family should be. By the end of this course, you should have a much broader understanding of what a family is and the significance of families for our society. It is within the family that socialization occurs and the family is the site where we derive many of our personal experiences, which may give the impression that family is very personal. Yet, the institution of the family is fundamentally intertwined with larger institutions such as the economy, the workplace, and the state. Additionally, families can both reflect and reinforce societal inequities, such as those based on class, race, and gender. We therefore assess these linkages by taking a sociological approach to studying the family."
GSC 20517,"As a term in European cultural history, decadence most often indicates a late-nineteenth-century movement in which writers and artists provoked the respectable middle class with racy, sordid, overblown and/or absurdist subject matter and methods. This course explores that environment but also takes a broader view, examining alternative visions of decadence over the last two centuries and more, where decadence becomes one way of viewing secular modernity more generally.  Our materials include fiction, poetry, drama, philosophy, visual arts, cinema and criticism. Early on, we lay conceptual groundwork with texts by Freud and Nietzsche. Well-known authors (in addition to Freud and Nietzsche) include Charles Baudelaire, Oscar Wilde, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Walter Pater, Virginia Woolf, and Patrick Süskind. We also read several lesser-known authors and study films by Ken Russell, Peter Greenaway and Sally Potter. Please note that our discussion matter is not for the prudish or faint-hearted. Bring a tolerance for the grotesque and a readiness to think carefully about authors who deliberately challenge deeply held Western attitudes concerning morality and values. Assignments include two written exams (one or more in take-home format), an interpretive paper, and bi-weekly reflective writings."
GSC 20542,"): When discussions of modernism and modernity focus on the late nineteenth, early twentieth centuries, they also often center on those qualities of the movement described in the work of early modernist literary critics, such as Harry Levin or Edmund Wilson. Such examinations emphasized the modern movement's experiments in form, structure, linguistic representation, characterization, etc., while paying much less attention to the role of the modernist movement in the larger context of a given culture. In this course, we will explore the significance of the modern movement from the perspective of specifically American culture, as well as the manner and meaning of American literary participation in the movement. To that end, we will consider not only the work of authors generally accepted as American modernists, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway; we will also consider the role of authors such as Henry James and Edith Wharton, whose work bridges the late 19th-century and the modernism of the early 20th-century, and Theodore Dreiser , of the early Chicago Renaissance (1910-1925), as well as a number of authors from the Harlem Renaissance - all authors the consideration of whose work enlarges and expands traditional conceptions of American modernism. Along the way, we will examine pertinent issues such as social class, social mobility, gender relations, progressivism, primitivism, race and ethnicity, immigration, cosmopolitanism vs. regionalism, and the importance of the vernacular, especially as these inform the question of Americanness and its role in our understanding of American literature during this time. The overarching goal of our exploration will be the effort to arrive at a much more comprehensive, more nuanced perspective on the meaning and significance of the modern in American culture. In exploring these different vantage points in American literary modernity, we will seek to reimagine the contours of the modern in the American context from the perspective of American modernisms, while drawing important conclusions about their significance within the larger modernist context."
GSC 20601,"Have you ever pondered how people live(d) in a world without television, YouTube, smartphones, and automobiles? Why have bellbottoms come and gone twice in the last 50 years? Will we be forced to relive the fashion mistakes of the 1970s and 1980s? What new stuff will people invent and sell next? In asking and answering these questions, we must focus on one underlying query: What does our stuff really say about who we are and who we want to be? This course combines lectures, discussions, and interactive small group activities to explore the nature and breadth of peoples' relationships with their things. We will investigate why and how people make and use different types of objects, and how the use of these material goods resonates with peoples' identities in the deep past, recent history, and today. Since everyone in the class will already be an expert user and consumer of things, we will consider how people today use material objects to assert, remake, reclaim, and create identities, and compare today's practices to those of people who lived long ago. Class members will learn about how anthropologists, including ethnographers (studying people today) and archaeologists (studying past peoples) think about and approach the material nature of our social, economic, and political lives. We will discuss why styles and technologies change through time, and why, in the end, there is very little new under the sun in terms of human behaviors and the way people produce and consume goods. The topical breadth of this workshop encompasses most social science disciplines, including history, economics, psychology, and anthropology, and resonates with classics, art history, and gender studies."
GSC 20680,"In this course, we will examine writers who engage ghosts, haunting, and the supernatural to explore how oppressive systems of power, though pervasive, are rendered imperceptible due to their historical persistence. We will unpack how writers engage with ghosts and the supernatural to interrogate issues of power, gender, race, sexuality, and class. We will critically examine what these classed, gendered, and raced intersections reveal to us about American culture, ideology, history, identity, and future trajectories. We will interrogate, reflect, and deconstruct how writers affirm, challenge, and negotiate identity and conceptualize American society through their engagement with ghosts."
GSC 30111,"Disability has long been constructed as the opposite of higher education. Universities are places that valorize, even demand, physical and intellectual ability. Disability, in turn, is often seen as something that does not fit within a university context, a problem that must be fixed. This antithetical relationship between disability and the university is rooted in history—eugenical curriculums, research programs that study disabled people—but it continues today. Despite a growing focus on diversity in university admissions and populations, disabled students enter higher education at a lower rate than non-disabled students and are less likely to graduate. In addition, universities perpetuate cultures of ableism in both faculty and students by prioritizing ability, perfection, and achievement. This course interrogates the relationship between disability and higher education with a special focus on our university, Notre Dame. Students will be introduced to fundamental principles in disability studies; explore the place of disability in higher education; and, drawing on scholarship in critical university studies, consider intersections between ableism, racism, and sexism in university contexts. Students will also think and learn about what inclusive and accessible education might look like. The course will conclude with a student-driven project designed to increase access, inclusiveness, and awareness about ableism and disability at Notre Dame."
GSC 30297,"The purpose of this course is to introduce students to major themes in the global history of slavery with a specific focus on the location of slavery in the making of the modern world bringing together histories from the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean worlds. The course will focus upon these themes through literature, economics, and politics. In addition, the course will also introduce students to recent museum exhibitions, art exhibitions, digital history projects, films, and documentary compilations that all together have transformed how the global history of slavery is understood. "
GSC 30309,"This course explores the relationships among and between workers, employers, government policymakers, unions, and social movements since the end of World War II, as well as the ways in which those relationships have shaped and been shaped by American politics and culture more broadly. The United States emerged from the Second World War as the globe's unequaled economic and political power, and its citizens parlayed that preeminence into a long postwar economic boom that created, however imperfectly, the first truly mass middle-class society in world history. At the heart of that new society was the American labor movement, whose leaders and members ensured that at least some of the heady postwar profits made it into the wallets of workers and their families - and not just the wallets of union members, as working Americans generally experienced great improvement in wages, benefits, and economic opportunity during the quarter-century ending in 1970.  During those same years, civil rights activists challenged the historic workplace discrimination that kept African Americans at the bottom of the labor market, confronting the racism of employers, unions, and the government, and inspiring others, primarily Mexican-Americans and women, to broaden the push for equality at the workplace.  Since that time, however, Americans have experienced a transformation in the workplace -- an erosion of manufacturing and the massive growth of service and government work; a rapid decline in number of union members and power of organized labor; and unresolved conflicts over affirmative action to redress centuries of racial and gender discrimination.  Meanwhile, income inequality and wealth disparities have grown every year over the past three decades. What accounts for the decline of organized labor since 1970, and why have the people of the mythic land of milk and honey experienced declining upward mobility and widening gaps between the rich and everyone else?  Are these phenomena linked?  What has the decline of the labor movement meant for workers specifically, and the American economy and politics more broadly? How and why have popular perceptions of unions changed over time? What has been the relationship of organized labor to the civil rights movement, feminism, modern conservatism, and the fortunes of individual freedom more broadly? What is globalization, and what has been its impact upon American workers? Through an exploration of historical scholarship, memoirs, polemical writings, and films, this course will try to answer these questions and many others.  It will also address the prospects for working people and labor unions in the twenty-first century.  This course satisfies the university history requirement and is open to all students; no previous knowledge of the topic is required."
GSC 30637,"This class looks at how women's voices emerge in Irish literature/art from the bloodthirsty warrior queens and powerful sovereignty goddesses of medieval saga to today's activist punk poets and videographers, exploring both how women are represented by others and how they choose to answer back. We will consider key genres of Irish verbal art in a wide range of compositions from medieval to contemporary. We will be helped along by relevant literary, anthropological and cultural criticism. How do women speak? How do women speak? Are these works subversive of our expectations or conservative in their relation to the status quo? How can we acknowledge and deconstruct misogyny not as inevitable but as historically and contextually conditioned and subject to demystifying critique? What vantage can we gain on Irish literary history by asking these historical, theoretical and political questions? How do tradition and the canon look when we view them through a gendered lens? What kind of impersonations might we engage in when we read...and write? Genres considered include courtly love poetry, contemporary feminist verse, oral lament, modern love poetry, bardic verse, storytelling, early modern allegorical poetry, folk song, medieval allegory, and contemporary comic verse, all read in English. Your own work for the course will include papers of literary/cultural analysis, a presentation, and a creative writing option for those who want to flex those muscles.   "
GSC 30663,"This course gives students the opportunity to learn more about how Americans have thought about criminal responsibility and how their ideas have changed over time. Historians contend that the 19th century witnessed a transformation in the understanding of the origins of criminal behavior in the United States. The earlier religious emphasis on the sinfulness of all mankind, which made the murderer into merely another sinner, gave way to a belief in the inherent goodness of humankind. But if humans were naturally good, how are we to explain their evil actions? And crime rates varied widely by sex and race; European women were said to have been domesticated out of crime doing. What do those variations tell us about a common human nature? The criminal might be a flawed specimen of humankind born lacking a healthy and sane mind. Relying in part upon studies done in Europe, American doctors, preachers, and lawyers debated whether insanity explained criminality over the century and how it expressed itself in different races and sexes. Alternative theories were offered. Environment, heredity, and free will were all said to have determined the actions of the criminal. By the early 20th century, lawyers and doctors had largely succeeded in medicalizing criminality. Psychiatrists now treated criminals as patients; judges invoked hereditary eugenics in sentencing criminals. Science, not sin, had apparently become the preferred mode of explanation for the origins of crime. But was this a better explanation than what had come before? Can it explain the turbulent debates in the late 20th and early 21st Centuries over variations in crime rates by race? Can it explain why men, not women, are still more likely to commit murder?"
GSC 30664,"This course provides an overview of the complex ways in which gender and sexuality are relevant to a study of the state, both domestically and on the international stage.

Pre-Requisites: either Introduction to Peace Studies or 1 course in Gender Studies or instructor permission"
GSC 30667,"This course begins with a study of the U.S. criminal legal system - its history, its goals, its effects, and how it is embedded in larger systems of power linked with race, gender, and economics. Our greater purpose, however, is to get at deeper concerns about violence, harm, and justice: what we want a justice system to accomplish, why punishment is at the center of our current system, and our own responsibility for that system that operates in our names. As part of the national Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program, the course involves inside students (who are incarcerated at the Westville Correctional Facility in Westville, IN) and outside students (who are enrolled at Notre Dame, St. Mary's, and Holy Cross) learning with and from each other and breaking new ground together. Each week, campus students travel to Westville for class with the incarcerated students; all are responsible for the same reading and writing assignments, and all participate together in class activities and discussions. Together, we will examine myths and realities related to crime and punishment, explore the effects of the criminal legal system and its policies, and develop ideas for responding more effectively to violence and harm in our communities.

GSC 30676,"Football is one of the most enduringly popular and significant cultural activities in the United States. Since the late 19th century, football has occupied an important place for those wishing to define and understand America. And Notre Dame football plays a central role in that story, with larger-than-life figures and stories, from Knute Rockne's Win one for the Gipper line to the Four Horsemen backfield that led the program to a second national championship in 1924. The mythic proportions of the University's football program cast a long shadow on the institution's history, cultural significance, and traditions. This course focuses on Notre Dame football history as an entry point into larger questions about the cultural, historical, and social significance of football in the U.S. Who has been allowed to play on what terms? How have events from Notre Dame football's past been remembered and re-imagined? How has success in Notre Dame football been defined and redefined? In particular, the course will focus on how Notre Dame football became a touchstone for Catholic communities and institutions across the country navigating the fraught terrain of masculinity, immigration, whiteness, and religious practice. This course will take up those questions through significant engagement with University Archive collections related to Notre Dame football, working toward increased levels of description and access for these materials. This course will include hands-on work with metadata, encoding and markup, digitization, and digital preservation/access through a collaboration with the University Archives and the Navari Family Center for Digital Scholarship. Readings for this course will include chapters from texts such as Murray Sperber's Shake Down the Thunder: The Creation of Notre Dame Football (1993), TriStar Pictures' Rudy (1993), Steve Delsohn's Talking Irish: The Oral History of Notre Dame Football (2001), Jerry Barca's Unbeatable: Notre Dame's 1988 Championship and the Last Great College Football Season (2014), David Roediger's Working Toward Whiteness: How America's Immigrants Became White (2005), David Roediger's The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class (1991), and Noel Ignatiev's How the Irish Became White (1995). Class meetings will be split between discussions of conceptual readings and applied work with library and information science technologies and systems. Coursework may include response papers, hands-on work with data, and a final project. Familiarity with archival methods, library/information science, data science, or computer science tools and methods is NOT a prerequisite for this course."
GSC 30677,"This course offers students an introduction to the theories and practices of contemporary art with a focus on artwork since 1980. We will investigate its varied, multi-faceted terrain, and examine key themes and ideas that have been explored in recent years. These include such topics as the artist as curator, the museum reconsidered, art and politics, the emergence of DIY approaches, and the rise of interest in new media and materials. Special attention will be paid to the way that new media and formats, like digital photography, sound, and installation, have changed the scope and reception of art now. "

The topics will focus on a woman's life, from infancy and childhood, through adolescence and reproductive years, to old age. We will examine the physiological, social, psychological, economic, cultural, political, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence women's health, and the role of poverty, discrimination, and unequal health access. Topics such as determinants of women's health, reproductive health, sexual health, cardiovascular health, maternal health, cancers of the reproductive tract, mental and emotional health, substance use and abuse, and various forms of violence against women will be discussed. At the end of the course, students should have a solid grasp of key issues affecting the health of women in different cultural contexts globally, and how women can be empowered to take actions that positively influence their health."

GSC 35650,"This course will examine the long history of struggle for civil rights by the Latina and Latino communities. Representing an estimated 65.3 million residents of the United States, the demographic is the largest minority group. However, their experiences represent a clear paradox. Despite their “American” identity, they remain “Others” to many in the United States. Beginning with the forceful incorporation of ethnic Mexicans in the mid-nineteenth century, this course covers the triumphs and failures of collective action by this community for various rights and access on their path to inclusion. These include workplace strikes for equal pay, unionization drives, walkouts against educational discrimination, interfaith alliances for immigration rights, and more. Through covering various topics, this course documents the strategies Latinas and Latinos utilized in their social movements and negotiates the consequences of those tactics and their lasting influence in their communities. In these struggles for equality, Latinas and Latinos advocated for educational reform, reshaped public space, and influenced the negotiations of their place in society."
GSC 40001,"This interdisciplinary seminar provides students with an overview of key concepts and terms in theories about gender and closely related topics. Students will read prominent feminist and queer theorists of gender, analyze their arguments, and learn to critique and apply them. We will explore contemporary theories, including those from outside feminist theory, that expand our understanding of gender beyond the binaries of male/female and masculine/feminine, consider conceptions of kinship beyond heteronormative models, and explore the ways gendered distinctions operate in dynamic interaction with other forms of difference such as race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic class, sexuality, and religion. Our overriding project will be to understand what these theories mean in their specific sociohistorical contexts and to contemplate their potential implications for our own and others’ lives, and for culture and society at large. This seminar requires close reading and discussion of theoretically rigorous and critically sophisticated texts and thus requires the active participation of committed students."
GSC 40234,"This course will introduce students to medieval romance, one of the most popular genres of medieval literature and one that gives us some of the best-loved literary characters of all time, including Lancelot and Guinevere. We will study the genre of romance, including Arthurian romance and other varieties, from the genre's inception. We will pay particular attention to the form of story-telling that it popularizes, the concept of love that it systematizes, the constructions of masculinity and femininity that it values, and the notion of heroism on which it depends. We will read many texts in their original Middle English, but no prior knowledge of Middle English or medieval literature is expected."

GSC 40873,"The 2016 film I Am Not Your Negro encourages a new generation to explore the life and work of James Baldwin (1924-1987). Directed by Haitian-born filmmaker Raoul Peck, I Am Not Your Negro is a provocative documentary that envisions a book Baldwin never finished by providing insight into Baldwin's relationship with three men who were assassinated before their fortieth birthdays - Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr. In this course we will interrogate questions of race, sexuality, violence, and migration. Our current political moment encourages the examination of these issues while Baldwin's life and work provides the ideal vantage point for their investigation. Using I Am Not Your Negro as our starting point, Baldwin's life and work will allow us the opportunity to explore transatlantic discourses on nationality, sexuality, race, gender, and religion. We will also explore the work of other writers including Richard Wright, Frantz Fanon, Audre Lorde, and Ta-Nehisi Coates."
GSC 40970,"In this course, we explore questions of gender and sexuality across a range of cultural contexts to ask: what, if anything, makes social identities different in the global south and the global north? What might it mean to feel strange––and in whose eyes might someone appear strange? What do we even think strangeness is? We’ll explore how theories of gender and sex intersect with recent queer and trans fiction and nonfiction from the global south, and if they might offer theoretical frames of their own. Readings will include work from Agha Shahid Ali, Akwaeke Emezi, Ismat Chughtai, Carmen Maria-Machado, Virginia Woolf, and theory from Sara Ahmed, Paul B.

Topics we expect to cover include the metaphysics of gender (e.g., the sex-gender distinction, the nature of masculinity and femininity, gender essentialism vs. gender constructivism); implicit bias and hermeneutic injustice; sexual harassment, violence, and the nature of consent; gender, feminism, and religion; and intersectionality."
GSC 43540,"This seminar is an introduction to the critical study of archives, particularly for those interested in historical research. Historians are generally aware that archives are not mere repositories of information, but we do not always think about the ways buildings and institutions guide our research.  We will read theoretical critiques of archives, with special attention to the ways that archives marginalize, naturalize, or silence certain bodies and practices. Part of the seminar will center Atlantic history, colonial Latin America, and the history of slavery.  We will also carry out a practicum, visiting archives on campus and nearby as well as those hosted online, to see how these issues play out in particular ways. Open to graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates (who should contact professor for more information)."
GSC 43810,"This seminar examines the relationship between art and social movements in Latinx communities from the civil rights era to the present. The course will focus on graphic art media that negotiates relations of power, constructs multiple publics, and fuels many of the debates around the politics of identity. We will consider notions of authorship (collective/individual), activism, display, dissemination, consumption, collecting, and technology. Students will learn to think critically and empathetically about how these collective modes of art-making foreground the politics of representation: what we see, how we see, who gets to control our image, and how can printed multiples challenge those narratives. Students will enhance their skills in visual analysis and writing, gain experience in collaborative printmaking, and refine their ability to conduct original research."

The senior thesis is a professional piece of scholarly writing featuring original research based on the student's interdisciplinary research in their gender studies major, ideally incorporating any additional fields of study they are pursuing. The Gender Studies senior thesis may build upon, but cannot replicate, the work done for a senior thesis or paper in another major or course. This course fulfills the senior capstone project requirement for Gender Studies majors. It is taken in the fall semester of the senior year (3 credits) and finished in the spring semester (3 credits). For the thesis to be accepted by Gender Studies, the minimum page requirement is 30-50 pages (excluding notes and bibliography).  In the spring semester of the junior year, interested students should speak to the DUS about planning their thesis topic and research and securing a faculty advisor. In the fall semester of the senior year, students will identify (in consultation with the DUS and their thesis advisor) a second Gender Studies faculty member to serve as a research consultant.  By the end of the fall semester, students submit to the DUS a working bibliography and a 1-2 paragraph summary of the project's direction to date (including total number of pages drafted); this prospectus is approved by both their thesis advisor and the second faculty member and is required for a passing grade on the fall semester. The thesis is due, approved by the thesis advisor, by the second Friday in April. Students are expected to submit their thesis to the Genevieve D. Willis Senior Thesis Prize Competition. "
GSC 60001,"This interdisciplinary seminar provides students with an overview of key concepts and terms in theories about gender and closely related topics. Students will read prominent feminist and queer theorists of gender, analyze their arguments, and learn to critique and apply them. We will explore contemporary theories, including those from outside feminist theory, that expand our understanding of gender beyond the binaries of male/female and masculine/feminine, consider conceptions of kinship beyond heteronormative models, and explore the ways gendered distinctions operate in dynamic interaction with other forms of difference such as race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic class, sexuality, and religion. Our overriding project will be to understand what these theories mean in their specific sociohistorical contexts and to contemplate their potential implications for our own and others’ lives, and for culture and society at large. This seminar requires close reading and discussion of theoretically rigorous and critically sophisticated texts and thus requires the active participation of committed students."
GSC 60701,"In this graduate course in political theory and literature, we will discuss the classics of Enlightenment-era political thought from Hobbes to Wollstonecraft that evolved in relation to English and French fantasy, gothic-romantic, science fictional, and adventure-exploration verse epic and novels from the 1648 Peace of Westphalia to the immediate aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars and the 1815 Congress of Vienna. To trace the transmogrification of the concept and trope of the monster in modern European political thought on sovereignty, freedom, rights, revolution, legitimate constitutional government, gender, sexuality, family, race, rank, education, war, peace, conquest, slavery, colonialism, empire, and international relations, we will read Hobbes's Leviathan (1651); selections from Milton's verse epic Paradise Lost (1667); Locke's Second Treatise of Government (1689-90); Defoe's novel Robinson Crusoe (1719); Rousseau's First Discourse (1750), Second Discourse (1755), and his novel Emile, or On Education (1762); Kant's What is Enlightenment? (1784) and Speculative Beginning of Human History (1786); Madison's Federalist No. 51 (1788); Kant's Theory and Practice (1793)  and Perpetual Peace (1795); selections from Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790); Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790), selections from her A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), and her novel Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman (1798); and Shelley's novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus (1818). We will also cover the related scholarly debates in political theory, intellectual history, feminist theory, and literature on these topics."
GSC 63000,"Students in the Interdisciplinary Seminar read widely across feminist and queer scholarship in multiple fields, including the interdisciplinary field of Gender Studies, and consider how disciplinary norms and boundaries shape scholarly inquiry. Student research and writing for the course will synthesize disciplinary ways of knowing and produce original, interdisciplinary Gender Studies scholarship or creative work. The Interdisciplinary Seminar fulfills both the IS requirement for Gender Studies graduate minors and the capstone requirement for Gender Studies primary and supplemental majors. Although each iteration of the course focuses on a unique topic, all Interdisciplinary Seminars put multiple disciplines in conversation in order to deepen students' mastery of key Gender Studies concepts. Course descriptions for current and upcoming semesters can be found at <a href=""https://genderstudies.nd.edu"" target=""_blank"">https://genderstudies.nd.edu</a>."
GSC 83540,"This seminar is an introduction to the critical study of archives, particularly for those interested in historical research. Historians are generally aware that archives are not mere repositories of information, but we do not always think about the ways buildings and institutions guide our research.  We will read theoretical critiques of archives, with special attention to the ways that archives marginalize, naturalize, or silence certain bodies and practices. Part of the seminar will center Atlantic history, colonial Latin America, and the history of slavery.  We will also carry out a practicum, visiting archives on campus and nearby as well as those hosted online, to see how these issues play out in particular ways. Open to graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates (who should contact professor for more information)."
GSC 90870,"This course will examine Afro-Cuban expressive culture from the last decade of the eighteenth century to the contemporary moment. Divided into three periods, colonial (1791-1895), early republic (1895-1959), and revolutionary (1959-present), the course will address the history, political movements, and cultural forms of expression (religion, music, literature, film, etc.) that have helped to create and identifiable Afro-Cuban culture. So too, the course will examine the tensions between Afro-Cuban culture and mainstream Cuban culture, the ongoing interchange between the two, and thus the impact of an African presence in the ongoing evolution of cubanidad."
HESB 10010,"In the aftermath of 9/11, with American troops deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq, and concern about the nuclear ambitions of such nations as North Korea and Iran, national security is the phrase that is often discussed and is of crucial importance to informed citizens. This course will examine national security policy: what it is, how it is formulated and executed, and how US national security policies have evolved since the 1890s. Using a variety of readings and films such as Casablanca and Dr. Strangelove, this course will examine US national security policies from the late 1890s through two world wars, the interwar period, the Cold War, the post-Cold War years, and up to the current post-9/11 world. We will identify continuities and departures in historic US national security policies, and consider the roles of policymakers and their critics in a self-governing society."
HESB 20000,"Back in 1787, Benjamin Franklin was asked what kind of government the new American Constitution created. He responded, a republic, if you can keep it. Today, many people are asking whether the republic-and thus democracy in America-as we know it will survive. Trust is low, polarization is high, and longstanding democratic norms are being shattered left and right. Some scholars have even suggested that the US is on the brink of a new civil war. Others, however, argue that things are not as bad as they seem.   This course tackles the big questions about current state of democracy in the United States. Is the US actually a democracy? (And is that different than a republic?) If so, how, when, and why did it become a democracy? Will the US remain a democracy? Finally, what role can YOU play in keeping the republic?   This course is designed for students of all backgrounds and majors. Whether you have thought a lot or a little about the state of democracy in America, you are welcome in this class.   "
HESB 20002,"An introduction to economics, with particular attention to the pricing mechanism, competitive and monopolistic markets, government regulation of the economy, labor-management relations and programs, income determination and public policy, trade and the international economy."
HESB 20010,"Public policy could be fairly described as applied social science. This course will introduce you to the fundamentals of public policy by (1) understanding how policy is crafted, (2) detailing the linkages between public opinion and public policy, (3) appreciating how political institutions may bound policy outcomes, (4) and exploring the ability of special interests, and other parties, to shape policy outcomes all while introducing you to various tools and frameworks for approaching the study of public policy. These tools will draw from an understanding of human behavior (psychology), markets (economics), governments (political science), and organizations (sociology) and introduce you to policy analysis. We will use a case study approach to delve into current public policy controversies including healthcare, higher education finance, and infrastructure. This course acts as the primary introductory course for the Hesburgh Minor in Public Service, but is designed for students of all majors and interests."
HESB 20211,"This course examines the interrelationships between economic injustice and violence. It begins by investigating the gap between rich and poor both in the US and worldwide. We also look at the history of Christian thought on wealth and poverty. We then address the ways in which economic disparity intersects with the problem of violence in both domestic (violence against women) and political realms (war and revolution). Next, we canvass Christian thought on the use of violence. This raises the question of whether Christianity itself contributes more to violence or to peace. Finally, we pose the question of whether forgiveness for violence is advisable or feasible. "
HESB 20218,"This course is an introduction to political theory as a tradition of discourse and as a way of thinking about politics. The course surveys selected works of political theory and explores some of the recurring themes and questions that political theory addresses, especially the question of justice. This introductory course fulfills the political theory breadth requirement for the political science major."
HESB 20219,"Many have claimed that the American educational system is the great equalizer among men. In other words, the educational system gives everyone a chance to prosper in American society regardless of their social origins. In this course, we will explore the validity of this claim. Do schools help make American society more equal by reducing the importance of class, race, and gender as sources of inequality, or do schools simply reinforce existing inequalities and reproduce pre-existing social relations? Topics covered in the course include: unequal resources among schools, sorting practices of students within schools, parents' role in determining student outcomes, the role of schooling in determining labor market outcomes for individuals, and the use of educational programs as a remedy for poverty."
HESB 20220,"The United States is beset by many serious social problems such as educational inequality, extreme poverty alongside unparalleled abundance, crime and deviance, health disparities, mass incarceration, and the persistence of discrimination along lines of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, class, gender, and sexuality. Course materials are designed to engage student learning, illustrate the distinctive features of the sociological perspective, and to start you thinking sociologically about yourself and the broader world. To think sociologically requires you to recognize that our contemporary world, with its enduring cultural, political, and economic institutions, is as much a social product as we are. In this course, students will learn to take a sociological perspective not only in examining the causes, consequences, and solutions to some of society’s most troubling social problems, but also in taking a critical look at their own perceptions of problems."
HESB 20222,An examination of the relationship between thought and action in light of contemporary and traditional accounts of the nature of ethics.
HESB 20223,"This course explores the ethical challenges posed by the ongoing revolution in the technology of war. After learning about some general, philosophical approaches to ethical decision making, we will examine a wide range of new weapons technologies, from smart bombs, drones, and robots to em (electromagnetic) weapons, cyberwar, and bio-enhancement, asking the question whether the existing framework of Just War Theory and the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) are adequate for war as it will be fought in the 21st century."
HESB 20225,"The family is often agreed to be the primary and most fundamental of social institutions. It is within this institution that early socialization and care-giving usually take place, and therefore, many of our ideas about the world are closely tied to our families. This course will give students the opportunity to learn about the diverse forms the family has taken over time and across different groups. This knowledge will be useful in examining the ongoing debate about the place of the family in social life. By taking a sociological approach to learning about the family and by gaining knowledge about national family trends and patterns in the U.S., this course will give students the theoretical and empirical tools for understanding how family life is linked to the social structure, to economic, cultural, and historical events and transitions, and to societal factors like race, class, and gender."
HESB 20227,"The objective of this course is to explore how and why individuals and social groups rebel against authority, particularly in risky situations when rebellion is likely to incur significant personal and collective costs. This course will investigate the conditions that stoke rebellion against immoral and oppressive power structures, shared conditions, and social norms; how we know when authorities are acting immorally or unjustly; why injustice and illegitimacy only fuel rebellion in some cases and induce conformity in others; the various forms that resistance and rebellion can take; and the factors that shape rebellion's varied forms, such as exit, sabotage, protest, withholding, reclamation, violent struggle, and revolution. The empirical topics covered will address a range of rebellion under tyranny, including but not limited to rebellion during slavery in the United States, rebellion againstNazi power and the Holocaust during World War II, and resistance to colonialism and imperialism."
HESB 20228,"Most Americans think of the inner city as a place of misery, danger, and despair. Why do most American cities have racially segregated areas dominated by concentrated poverty? What are the lives of inner-city residents like? Why do the legal, political, economic, and educational institutions that serve these communities struggle so mightily to improve the lives of inner-city residents? In this course, we will address all of these questions by viewing all five seasons of The Wire, David Simon's epic tale of life in inner-city Baltimore. Sociological theory and research will serve as powerful tools to help students decode The Wire, and better understand the institutional forces that created and perpetuate inner city poverty, violence, and disorder."
HESB 20229,"This seminar examines a number of important topics in medicine and society today, including shared health responsibility, race and class-based inequities, vaccinations, opioid crisis, beginning and end-of-life care, organ donation and body modification, health of imprisoned populations, mental health of healthcare providers, and health in the age of social media. Students in this class will gain an understanding of the ethical, social, and practical dimensions of a variety of healthcare and health policy issues and how providers navigate these dimensions in their care. A key part of the class is the opportunity for students to engage directly with healthcare workers who will serve as guest speakers. The seminar will emphasize writing and journaling, and will directly integrate matters of health care with broader humanistic and social science approaches to health, wellbeing, the body, etc. to deepen students' understandings of what medicine is. This is a core course in the Health, Humanities, and Society minor."

HESB 30091,"This course prepares students for their semester of study in Washington D.C., including their internship search."
HESB 30092,"This course explores how economic, social, and political inequality are reflected in various components of the U.S. governing system and how U.S. political institutions shape the distribution of power and economic well being. We will examine the role of Congress, the presidency, courts, separation of powers, veto points, and federalism in reproducing economic and social inequality. We will also examine how economic and racial inequality are embedded in the design of U.S. political institutions. A core ongoing theme of the course is whether and how U.S. democracy can survive and thrive in the face of a variety of enduring inequalities. The course will include a combination of lecture and discussion. Assessment will be based on a series of short written assignments and/or quizzes as well as a substantial final paper with a collaborative and individual option."
HESB 30101,"This course is designed to show students how to interpret and critically evaluate statistics commonly used to describe, predict, and evaluate in the social sciences, as well as many areas of the business and/or medical world.  The focus is on a conceptual understanding of what the statistic does, means and what assumptions are made from it.  Hands-on experience in using data analysis is part of the course."
HESB 30103,"This CAD course looks back to 1850, when urban industrial America began, and looks forward to 2050, when Notre Dame promises to be carbon neutral, to critically engage competing visions of individual, communal, and ecological flourishing. It focuses on economic, racial, and environmental justice as students explore how US political culture, the discipline of American Studies, and Catholic social teaching have clashed and converged and Americans proposed varying solutions to poverty, racism, and environmental degradation. After an introduction to American Studies, we turn to visions of the good life in foundational US political documents (the Declaration, the Constitution, and Inaugural Addresses) and in Catholic tradition (scriptural passages, theological essays, and papal encyclicals, from Rerum Novarum to Laudato Si'). Then the course's three main sections consider, in turn, economic equity, racial justice, and environmental restoration. Each section includes a faith in action case study and concludes with an integrative essay that puts Catholic social teaching into conversation with American Studies scholarship. In the final class session, Learning Groups present their synthesis of the course material, and, during the exam period, each student submits a final integrative essay that focuses on one of the issues—poverty, racism, or environmental degradation—and identifies what American Studies might learn from the Catholic Tradition and what the Catholic Tradition might learn from American Studies."
HESB 30104,This course seeks to introduce the student to the principles of probability and statistical theory appropriate for the study of economics. The emphasis of the course will be on hypothesis testing and regression analysis.
HESB 30110,"Political polarization in American politics has reached a new level of contentiousness in the last two to three decades. The media tells us members of the American public are balkanized into red and blue states, whose respective residents clash along partisan lines during every national election. Headlines proclaim we are a nation divided, the moderate middle is a thing of the past, and there is no remedy in sight. In this course, we will investigate the breadth and depth of political polarization in the United States among politicians, activists, and the public, as well as its social, partisan, and political origins. We will also consider the consequences of political polarization for American democracy, including its impact on electoral politics, democratic representation, and public policy."
HESB 30210,"This course serves as a gateway for subsequent coursework in international security. It is a required course in the Notre Dame International Security Center's undergraduate certificate program requirements, but it is also appropriate for, and open to, any Notre Dame students interested in U.S. national security policymaking.  It will begin with an account of the history and development of U.S. national security policy from the Founding through the present.  Next, it examines the current state of the primary institutions involved in U.S. national security policymaking.  Finally, it explores the tools and instruments of military statecraft as applied by the United States.  The course culminates with a simulation exercise in which students will role-play key participants in the U.S. national security policymaking process. At a minimum, that students will gain from it the analytical tools, historical knowledge, and current-events background to become more informed citizens, particularly with respect to important national debates about when and how our country should use military force.  At a maximum, the course may lead some students to become interested enough in the topic to pursue a career in either the practice or the study of U.S. national security policy.

HESB 30261,"Catholicism and Politics poses the question, both simple and complex: How ought Catholics to think about the political order and political issues within it?  The first part of the course will survey major responses to this question drawn from Church history: the early church, the medieval church, and the modern church.  The second part applies these models to contemporary issues ranging among war, intervention, globalization, abortion, the death penalty, religious freedom, gender issues, and economic development.  The course culminates in Vatican III, where teams of students, representing church factions, gather to discover church teachings on selected controversial political issues."
HESB 30284,"This course will explore the intellectual foundations of the constellation of ideas that have become the dominant political worldviews in modern American society. The course will focus on European sources of each tradition, as well as developments of each in America. Concepts that will be explored include progress, historicism, pragmatism, liberty, equality, diversity, cosmopolitanism, localism, tradition, prescription, authority, secularism and religion, particularly Catholicism."
HESB 30286,"In Constitutionalism, Law and Politics II: American Constitutionalism, we shall study fundamental texts of the American constitutional and political tradition in an attempt to answer questions such as: What is the purpose of government? What is the meaning of political equality? What is political liberty and how is it best secured? Since we lack the time for a comprehensive survey of American political thinkers, we shall examine select statesmen and critical historical periods, focusing on the Founding era, Lincoln and the slavery crisis, and the Progressive era and New Deal."
HESB 30300,"Immigration is an issue of increasing importance in the United States. Few issues have generated as much debate and emotion as the immigration policy. The goal of this course is to provide students with an overview of the critical normative and academic questions in political science regarding immigration in the U.S. What factors have affected contemporary and historical immigration policy in the United States? In particular how have economics, demographics, politics, religion, culture, environmental concerns, and ethnic and nationalist interests impacted the nature of immigration politics and policy? How have groups leveraged political influence for desired immigration policy outcomes? We will study the impact of worldwide immigration and population trends on the formulation of American policy. The emphasis will be on an academic understanding of how immigration policy has been affected by domestic and international demographic and political factors"
HESB 30301,"The United States is the most powerful state in the world today. Its actions are important not just for US citizens, but they also affect whether others go to war, whether they will win their wars, whether they receive economic aid, whether they will go broke, or whether they will starve. What determines US foreign policy? What is the national interest? When do we go to war? Would you send US soldiers into war? If so, into which wars and for what reasons? How do our economic policies affect others? Does trade help or hurt the US economy and its citizens? We first study several theories about foreign policy. We then examine the US foreign policy process, including the President, Congress, the bureaucracy, the media, and public opinion. To see how this all works, we turn to the history of US foreign policy, from Washington's farewell address through the World Wars and the Cold War to the Gulf War. We then study several major issue areas, including weapons of mass destruction, trade and economics, and the environment. Finally, we develop and debate forecasts and strategies for the future."
HESB 30303,"Some of the most dynamic and successful businesses are aspiring to a double or triple bottom line: profitability, beneficial human impact, and environmental sustainability. This course exposes students to a new and growing trend in leadership, venture creation, product design, and service delivery which uses the basic entrepreneurial template to transform the landscape of both for-profit and not-for-profit ventures."
HESB 30313,"This course examines how oil and natural gas have shaped international relations from the early twentieth century to the present, with a particular focus on conflict.  It begins by introducing students to the fundamentals of global energy production, consumption and trade, and then briefly surveys the political history of oil as it relates to the great powers.  The course then moves on to contemporary issues, including the political significance of fracking technology, the role of the United States in protecting Persian Gulf oil, and the extent to which Russia's dominant natural gas position might translate into political influence in Europe.  These and other topics are examined through numerous theoretical lenses, including theories of resource conflict, economic interdependence, political coercion, and petro-aggression."
HESB 30314,"This course combines economic theory and methods to study the production and delivery of education. We will apply economic principles to understand the rationale for particular education approaches, policies, and programs and use an economic lens to explore their potential impact. We will also learn about applying analytic tools to examine the effects of schooling as well as specific education interventions and reforms. Students will read empirical research and will practice being critical consumers of policy arguments and research findings. They will also complete problem sets and writing assignments with the goals of 1) using economic principles to inform policy debates about education investments, 2) employing evidence to evaluate the impact of education policies and programs, and 3) developing skills in conducting original research on education. Substantive topics will span early childhood education, K-12 schooling, and higher education with a focus on the role of incentives, prices, and markets throughout. The course will explore teacher labor markets and teacher effectiveness, school choice, and accountability, and will include discussion of international contexts."
HESB 30348,"This course will explore the roots of philanthropy in American society, the role philanthropy plays within the modern economy, and how philanthropic activity helps us create a better world and strive for the common good. The key component of the course requires students to act as a Board of Directors and use thoughtful analysis to award real grants to deserving nonprofits (a sum up to $50,000). Students are expected to come to each class prepared to discuss course readings, and to offer ideas and suggestions regarding the grant making process. Each student is also expected to complete two site visits to nonprofit organizations outside of normal class hours. Students will nominate nonprofits for awards and the class will systematically discuss, analyze, and ultimately vote to award the grants."
HESB 30352,"Reconciliation is increasingly becoming a popular notion in our time, finding its way into the political rhetoric and public policy of many governments. South Africa and its apparently successful Truth and Reconciliation Commission have captured the imagination of many post conflict societies (including nations like Rwanda, Bosnia, Northern Ireland and communities in the United States as they debate the merits and possibility of similar reconciliation efforts in their communities. Interest in reconciliation in the academic world has also increased, with scholarship on the topic and with institutions setting up reconciliation studies as a specialization sub field in the growing world of peace studies. It is perhaps not surprising that reconciliation has become a popular buzz world. The end of the cold war did not usher in a new world order of peace that many had hoped for. On the contrary, war, conflict and violence seem to be on the rise in a world marked by growing polarization between religious, ethnic and national identities. In the midst of such a fragmented and broken world, reconciliation is a rallying cry for some hope of healing, conflict resolution and solidarity among peoples. However, even as reconciliation has become popular, its meaning has remained vague, and its theological connections even more unclear. What difference if any does one's Christian faith make in the way one understands or pursues reconciliation? What's the Christian understanding of reconciliation anyway? What is the relation between reconciliation with God, and reconciliation in its social, political and economic dimensions? Why has Catholic discussions on reconciliation so much focused on the sacrament of reconciliation and not paid as much attention to the notion of social reconciliation? The course seeks to answer these and similar questions. "
HESB 30354,"We are living through a watershed moment in United States history. Structural racism is at the forefront of the national discourse. Yet, the threat that racism holds on our nation's most cherished ideals of democracy and justice is hardly new. Generations of activists, scholars, and everyday people have fought and persevered to bring about social, cultural, and policy change.     This course engages deeply with topics relevant to the national discourse on racial and ethnic relations in the U.S. The first part of the course examines key concepts, focusing on the social construction of race and ethnicity, prejudice, and discrimination. The second part reviews the historical experiences of Native Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans. The third and final part of the course centers on four critical issues that are especially relevant in 2020: (1) immigration; (2) political disenfranchisement; (3) racial and ethnic disparities in health; and (4) racism in the criminal justice system."
HESB 30383,"This course explores the relationships among and between workers, employers, government policymakers, unions, and social movements since the end of World War II, as well as the ways in which those relationships have shaped and been shaped by American politics and culture more broadly. The United States emerged from the Second World War as the globe's unequaled economic and political power, and its citizens parlayed that preeminence into a long postwar economic boom that created, however imperfectly, the first truly mass middle-class society in world history. At the heart of that new society was the American labor movement, whose leaders and members ensured that at least some of the heady postwar profits made it into the wallets of workers and their families - and not just the wallets of union members, as working Americans generally experienced great improvement in wages, benefits, and economic opportunity during the quarter-century ending in 1970. During those same years, civil rights activists challenged the historic workplace discrimination that kept African Americans at the bottom of the labor market, confronting the racism of employers, unions, and the government, and inspiring others, primarily Mexican Americans and women, to broaden the push for equality at the workplace. Since that time, however, Americans have experienced a transformation in the workplace -- an erosion of manufacturing and the massive growth of service and government work; a rapid decline in number of union members and power of organized labor; and unresolved conflicts over affirmative action to redress centuries of racial and gender discrimination. Meanwhile, income inequality and wealth disparities have grown every year over the past three decades. What accounts for the decline of organized labor since 1970, and why have the people of the mythic land of milk and honey experienced declining upward mobility and widening gaps between the rich and everyone else? Are these phenomena linked? What has the decline of the labor movement meant for workers specifically, and the American economy and politics more broadly? How and why have popular perceptions of unions changed over time? What has been the relationship of organized labor to the civil rights movement, feminism, modern conservatism, and the fortunes of individual freedom more broadly? What is globalization, and what has been its impact upon American workers? Through an exploration of historical scholarship, memoirs, polemical writings, and films, this course will try to answer these questions and many others. It will also address the prospects for working people and labor unions in the twenty-first century. "
HESB 30384,"This course examines how economic analysis can be applied to various components of the health care system. Microeconomic theory is used to understand the operation of health care markets and the behavior of participants (consumers, insurers, physicians, and hospitals) in the health care industry. International comparisons and the role of the public sector are discussed."
HESB 30385,"Do you want to learn how to solve problems that matter? Human Centered Design (HCD) is an empathetic tool that utilizes guided questioning related to product, service, or systems innovations to identify opportunities for sustainable, human-centered impact. For example, how might we design a cookstove that reduces the amount of smoke inhaled by a community member? How might we design a new service engaging low-income borrowers in rural communities? How might we design a system linking social innovators and their innovations to users across the globe in a manner that encourages collaboration and sharing of resources? Whether a social innovator is designing in the private, public or nonprofit sector, HCD provides a valuable framework, deeply rooted in empathy, and is an excellent methodology for social innovators who want to problem solve and design alongside communities. In this course students will be introduced to the HCD toolkit and will apply it in practice, either in a domestic or international context. This fast-paced course will take students through the HCD cycles of inspiration, ideation and implementation, and provide opportunities for student and community collaboration."
HESB 30389,"Social Entrepreneurship has sparked dialogue and debate for two decades. Its very definition is much debated, as well as its capacity to create sustainable, scalable, systems-changing impact. This course explores the theoretical concepts, practices and strategies associated with the dynamic discipline of social enterprise and innovation. For our purposes, social entrepreneurship is the landscape, of which paradigm-shifting solutions like microfinance, MSME (Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise) development, bottom of the pyramid, fair trade, impact investing, and the like, are components. This course will study many of these concepts, focusing on their opportunity for social impact, and as a vehicle for wealth creation in vulnerable and disenfranchised communities across the globe. Further, the course covers examples of various social enterprise models (for-profit, non-profit, hybrid), requiring students to analyze and devise strategies to improve the efficacy of these ventures. Finally, the course engages students in research seeking to advance the field of social entrepreneurship at the Keough School of Global Affairs and Notre Dame."
HESB 30392,"The Constitution holds a unique place in American law and political culture. Not only is it the basis of the federal government, it provides the framework for political debates about all manner of controversial issues in modern America. Today, there is much talk of a constitutional crisis in the United States. What does this mean? How can a history help us make sense of the Constitution and of our politics? This course explores the historical context in which the American Constitution was framed, ratified, and amended over time. Together, we will ask and answer the questions of how and why it was written the way it was; how and why it gained legitimacy; and how it was put into practice and interpreted over time. The class will introduce students to central historical problems, which include: Is the American Constitution democratic? Did the Constitution codify slavery into law? Is originalism a useful and valid way to interpret the Constitution? Course readings will consist primarily of primary source material, though students will also read historical interpretations of the Constitution and the process of forming, amending, and interpreting it. The discussion-based class will empower students to think historically about the American Constitution by interpreting primary source material, building arguments about causes and effects of particular constitutional points, and intervening in scholarly dialogues about the founding and its legacy. Students will be evaluated primarily based on class participation, a short primary source analysis, a role-play activity, and a final paper. "
HESB 30427,"Political parties play many vital roles in American politics: They educate potential voters about political processes, policy issues, and civic duties. They mobilize citizens into political activity and involvement. They provide vital information about public debates. They control the choices--candidates and platforms that voters face at the ballot box. They influence and organize the activities of government officials. Most importantly, by providing a link between government and the governed, they are a central mechanism of representation. These roles--how well they are performed, what bias exists, how they shape outcomes, how they have changed over time--have consequences for the working of the American political system."
HESB 30520,"What is the role of the police in a democracy? What are their powers? Who makes their rules and provides oversight? Do we even need them? How do citizens respond to the realities of being policed through political activism, day-to-day interactions, and music and literature? While the police are charged with maintaining one of the most fundamental functions of the state, the “monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force”, the answers to these questions vary dramatically around the world and throughout history. Partially driven by recent scandals involving police violence, activists, politicians, public security professionals, and social scientists have been carefully reconsidering their views on policing, recognizing the police as powerful political actors and policing policies as dynamic policy arenas. In this course, we will explore the history of crime fighting and police forces in the modern era, then dive into current debates and research about the organization, mission, and oversight of police forces in contemporary democracies, including social movements advocating for police reform. This course has a global perspective, gaining understanding of local experiences in the United States through comparative study of primarily Latin American, British, and Western European systems."
HESB 30568,"This course focuses on selected legal and policy issues related to K-12 education in the United States. A central theme is the intersection of K-12 schooling and the state, with a particular focus on Constitutional issues of religious freedom and establishment, student speech and privacy, parental choice, educational opportunity, and education reform trends such as charter schools and accountability measures.  Questions examined over the course of the semester include:  What are the most basic obligations of the state with regard to its regulation of K-12 education?  What are the most basic rights of parents in this regard?  In what ways does the 1st Amendment protect - and limit - the speech and privacy rights of K-12 schoolchildren?  In what ways may the state accommodate K-12 schools with an explicitly religious character? What are the Constitutional requirements with regard to religious speech or expression within K-12 public schools?  To what degree is the principle of equality manifest in the form of educational opportunity?  How has this changed over time?  In what ways have education reform trends such as charter schooling and increased accountability changed the policy landscape of K-12 education?"
HESB 30588,"This course introduces students to major actors, institutions, processes, and policies of sub-state governments in the United States.  Through an intensive comparative examination of historical and contemporary politics in city governments, we will gain an understanding of municipal government and its role within the larger contexts of state and national government."
HESB 30595,"This course covers the various issues relevant to the current early childhood education landscape.  This includes theories of early learning and child development, policy development in the United States, the issues of inequality and the achievement gap (particularly related to K-12 Education Reform) and research on interventions or what works in early childhood programming.  The advantage to understanding the theories of child development, the policy context and the intervention research is that it gives future teachers and future policymakers a foundational premise upon which to grow, analyze, learn and teach.  Topics covered will include: Theories of Child Development (Infant Schools to Present), Head Start and the CCDBG, State Preschool, Inequality and the Achievement Gap in the Early Years and Interventions in Early Childhood (HighScope/Perry Preschool, Abecedarian and Chicago Parent Studies, Head Start Research).  The goal of this class is to come away with a greater understanding of the language, the history, the goals and the possibilities in this policy area as well as its connections to other social welfare programs and to K-12 schooling.  Students will become more fluent in the language of early childhood education and will gain the foundational knowledge of past and current theories, laws, policies and educational interventions."
HESB 30618,"Class examines philosophical, constitutional, and political questions pertaining to religion and politics, including: Do individuals have a right to religious liberty? If so, how might that right be protected? How does the American Constitution protect the right to religious freedom? What is the proper relationship between church and state? Is religion necessary, good, or bad for liberal democracy? Readings include selections from classical, medieval, and modern political philosophy, leading cases of American constitutional law, and contemporary legal theorist and political scientists."
HESB 30626,"This course explores topics in American constitutional law related to civil liberties and civil rights. The course employs a variety of instructional methods including Socratic method lectures, class debates, and moot court exercises in which students play the role of lawyers and justices arguing a Supreme Court case. Students will explore the social and political struggles that have shaped freedom and equality in the United States, including debates over protest, hate speech, pornography, religious freedom, gun control, abortion, race, gender, and homosexuality."
HESB 30658,"Set against the first midterm elections of the Trump presidency, this course is an updated introduction to the political and lawmaking dynamics of the United States Congress. Once defined by pork-barrel spending, powerful committee chairmen, and limited competition, Congress is now dominated by gridlock and partisan warfare. The traditional legislative process appears to have collapsed as an avenue for policymaking, and Congress is now by far the least popular political institution in America. This course investigates how Congress is supposed to work, whether it ever actually worked that way, and what changed, bringing us to the biggest question: how it works - or doesn't work - today."
HESB 30660,"The purpose of this course is to provide students with an overview of the origins, concerns, goals, and approaches of education reform past, present, and future. We will explore the breadth of tactics and policy mechanisms employed by reformers, examining the underlying assumptions and theories of action ascribed to each. We will analyze the extent to which various reform efforts have been successful while concurrently defining and redefining the benchmarks for success as we explore questions such as: Who and what are schools for? What should the goals of improvement be? How do we best improve schools and who should decide? What are the origins and implications of differing policy and reform strategies? What assumptions drive different policy levers (i.e. turnaround, incentives, mandates, capacity-building, high-stakes accountability) and how do those in turn shape implementation and outcomes?"
HESB 30675,"This course in American political economy seeks to understand philosophically the relationship between politics and economics. We will begin by exploring the fundamental theories of economic life in the West through the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and Pope Leo XIII, paying particular attention to arguments for and against commercial society. We will then turn to the development of the American market and its role in shaping the character of individuals and the meaning of citizenship. Readings are drawn from, among others, Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton, Douglass, Wilson, Dewey, and DuBois. The course will end by considering the relationship between citizens and government in the contemporary United States. Throughout, we consider the ethics of the market economy, the system of production and exchange within which we live. Are its tremendous inequalities and accumulations just? How can we cultivate moderation amid consumerism? What role do virtue and leisure play in this system? Our task is to learn to produce and purchase in the service of a good life."
HESB 40102,"Almost all crimes, or even human interactions, contain a digital component. The fact that old laws don't always fit new problems is no more apparent than in the area of cybercrimes. This course will include discussion of topics including: the methodology of typical cyber investigations, the application of the Fourth Amendment to digital evidence, and different types of cyber-specific laws enforced today. The course will also focus on the responses of both courts and legislators to the ever-evolving issues presented by computer crimes."
HESB 40103,"Studying environmental politics can be a gloomy pursuit. There are a myriad of devastating problems and a seeming scarcity of scientific and technological fixes. Technical fixes aside, there is the even more problematic scarcity of political fixes. Political institutions often seem to obstruct rather than facilitate environmentally sound policies, and the mass public and political leaders often prioritize competing goals and policies. This course is designed to understand whether the pessimism is warranted and to search for the optimism: What are the best opportunities, scientific and political, for saving the planet? What can realistically be accomplished?"
HESB 40111,"Was the American Constitution originally a pro-slavery constitution that changed over time to a constitution that outlawed slavery and state-supported racial discrimination? Did the Civil War and subsequent developments through the civil rights acts of the 1960's represent a commitment implicit in constitutional principles from the nation's beginning? Do these constitutional principles embrace active governmental efforts to achieve an equal-opportunity society, including equal educational opportunity and an end to racism, a private attitude? Do constitutional principles promise a color-blind society? Or do they promise no more than color- blind governments? This course addresses these questions. Readings will include state documents like the Declaration of Independence and The Federalist Papers, the speeches of American politicians and other public figures, and decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court regarding slavery, public accommodations, education, voting, housing, and employment. Grades will be based on mid-term and final exams. Texts TBA."
HESB 40112,"Students, in a structured format, are involved in assessing, prioritizing and creatively solving problems encountered by low-income and other disadvantaged South Bend entrepreneurs. A process consulting approach is employed and a number of useful tools and frameworks are introduced. Students work with both for-profit and non-profit enterprises, producing tangible deliverables that help clients launch, grow and sustain their ventures."
HESB 43524,"Although America is world's richest nation, it has the most unequal distribution of wealth and income in the industrialized world.  In this course, we will examine why this is so.  In particular, we will examine the following questions: What social forces create inequality in society?  Is inequality inevitable?  Is there such a thing as social class?  Who gets ahead and why?  Why is race/ethnicity and gender still related to social status, wealth, and income?  Does America have a ruling elite?  Who are the poor and what explains their poverty?  Are there social policies that can create more equality in American society -- is that what Americans really want?"
HESB 43541,"One would think that secrets are hard to keep, and lies hard to maintain, because it doesn't take much for the truth to escape and once it's out, it can't be put back into the bottle. Yet secrets and lies reside at the heart of much social and political order, sometimes for years and even decades at a time. The objective of this course is to advance our scientific understanding of how this is possible, drawing on sociological, psychological, and historical research on such things as performance, secrecy, lying, forgetting, doubt, denial, and inattention. Case studies will include instances of corporate malfeasance (such as Ponzi schemes and insider trading), Big Tobacco's cover-up of the health consequences of smoking, the lies told by the totalitarian regime of North Korea, the secret British program to break the German cipher during WWII, elaborate attempts to cover up government atrocities, and the cat-and-mouse game between international inspectors and regimes thought to be developing banned weapons. Throughout, we will be concerned with the distinct methodological challenges of studying things many people want to keep secret. Requirements will include midterm and final examinations, reading quizzes/reaction papers, participation, and a final research paper.  "
HESB 43899,"In the United States, public policy has the potential to be a consequential mechanism to address the most vexing and important social and economic problems: inequality, poverty, mass incarceration, climate change and much more. But policies do not appear out of thin air. They are the product of complex political processes. Even after policies are made, political decisions determine how they are implemented and to what end. In order to evaluate or change policy, we must understand politics. That is the focus of this course. We begin with a review of theoretical approaches to conceptualizing and studying public policy. We then explore key policy actors (the President, interest groups, denizens etc.), as well as core aspects of policy design and implementation. Finally, we closely study contemporary policy arenas. Along the way, students will be challenged to grapple with the paradoxes of policy making and to envision pathways to substantive change. Father Hesburgh famously credited President Lyndon Johnson's commitment to civil rights with changing the face of America. This class recognizes that dramatic policy change must consider the politics behind that change and politics seeking to maintain the status quo. This course fulfills the capstone requirement for the Hesburgh Program in Public Service."
HESB 48000,"This course offers students an opportunity to pursue an independent capstone research project. Students will choose a faculty member that will guide them through the semester-long research, including producing a final research note or policy memo. Interested students should speak with the Hesburgh Program in Public Service academic advisor to obtain approval."
HHS 10722,"The overarching goal of this course is to provide students with a working knowledge of social psychology and, with that knowledge, to increase awareness of ourselves, the social world around us, and the connections between the two. This is a course about social interaction - how the self shapes and is shaped by others, how we interact in and with groups and social structures, and how we perceive the world around us. Because the subject of the course is the very social interactions in which we are immersed, it is expected that students will develop the habit of applying social psychological concepts to everyday life."
HHS 20033,"The United States is beset by many serious social problems such as educational inequality, extreme poverty alongside unparalleled abundance, crime and deviance, health disparities, mass incarceration, and the persistence of discrimination along lines of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, class, gender, and sexuality. Course materials are designed to engage student learning, illustrate the distinctive features of the sociological perspective, and to start you thinking sociologically about yourself and the broader world. To think sociologically requires you to recognize that our contemporary world, with its enduring cultural, political, and economic institutions, is as much a social product as we are. In this course, students will learn to take a sociological perspective not only in examining the causes, consequences, and solutions to some of society’s most troubling social problems, but also in taking a critical look at their own perceptions of problems."
HHS 20203,"This course introduces students to the field of social-cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropologists are primarily interested in exploring issues of human cultural diversity across cultures and through time. This course will explore key theoretical, topical, and ethical issues of interest to cultural anthropologists. We will examine diverse ways in which people around the globe have constructed social organizations (such as kinship, and political and economic systems) and cultural identities (such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, race, and class) and we will consider the impact of increasing globalization on such processes. Throughout the course we will consider how different anthropologists go about their work as they engage in research and as they represent others through the writing of ethnographies."
HHS 20210,"Psychiatry and mental healthcare have been the target of criticism and controversy for decades. Common critiques are that the field is not grounded in medical science, that it pathologizes normal problems in living, or that it is a method of social control. This course will focus on the social movements that have been critical of mental healthcare from the second half of the twentieth century to today. We will begin by considering questions such as: What is the proper role of mental healthcare? What is a social movement? What is the relationship between mental healthcare and politics? Then we will shift to discussing particular social movements including antipsychiatry, Mad Pride, the emergence of the concepts of disability and neurodiversity as alternatives to pathology, and other examples of service-user led activism. The goal of the course will be to better understand the ways that psychiatry has abused it power and imagine changes that could be made to the system to improve the lives of those who suffer from mental health conditions."
HHS 20228,"Many have claimed that the American educational system is the great equalizer. In other words, the educational system gives everyone a chance to prosper in American society regardless of their social origins. In this course, we will explore the validity of this claim. We will consider questions such as: 1) Does our educational system promote social mobility or social reproduction? 2) How has the relationship between race/ethnicity and educational performance changed in the last few decades? 3) How do social class and gender shape the kinds of educational experiences students have? 4) How does educational policy influence the kinds of experiences kids have in school? Can policy reduce inequality?"
HHS 20342,"The family is often agreed to be the primary and most fundamental of social institutions. It is within this institution that early socialization and care-giving usually take place, and therefore, many of our ideas about the world are closely tied to our families. This course will give students the opportunity to learn about the diverse forms the family has taken over time and across different groups. This knowledge will be useful in examining the ongoing debate about the place of the family in social life. By taking a sociological approach to learning about the family and by gaining knowledge about national family trends and patterns in the U.S., this course will give students the theoretical and empirical tools for understanding how family life is linked to the social structure, to economic, cultural, and historical events and transitions, and to societal factors like race, class, and gender. Enrollment questions should be directed to Sociology's DUS at mthoma13@nd.edu."
HHS 20555,"This seminar examines a number of important topics in medicine and society today, including shared health responsibility, race and class-based inequities, vaccinations, opioid crisis, beginning and end-of-life care, organ donation and body modification, health of imprisoned populations, mental health of healthcare providers, and health in the age of social media. Students in this class will gain an understanding of the ethical, social, and practical dimensions of a variety of healthcare and health policy issues and how providers navigate these dimensions in their care. A key part of the class is the opportunity for students to engage directly with healthcare workers who will serve as guest speakers. The seminar will emphasize writing and journaling, and will directly integrate matters of health care with broader humanistic and social science approaches to health, wellbeing, the body, etc. to deepen students' understandings of what medicine is.  This is a core course in the Health, Humanities, and Society minor"
HHS 20557,"Science and technology play a powerful role in structuring our world, in everything from our physical environment to our culture. It is thus imperative that we understand how these entities work. What constitutes reliable knowledge? How do the technological systems in which we are embedded throughout our lives come to be, and how can they be changed? In this historic moment of a global pandemic playing out against a backdrop of fake news, alternative facts and increasingly autonomous technologies, these questions are more critical than ever. This course introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of Science and Technology Studies in order to provide them with analytical and conceptual tools needed to confront the complex questions that arise where science and society intersect. Its objective is thus not so much to present a particular body of empirical information as it is to equip students with the analytical skills to understand complex multi-dimensional phenomena. The purpose is to give students both the opportunity and the tools to consider science and technology in a broader political, social, historical and economic context, and to reflect on how the practices of scientific and technological development shape their own individual and collective experience."
HHS 20806,"We are living through a watershed moment in United States history. Structural racism is at the forefront of the national discourse. Yet, the threat that racism holds on our nation's most cherished ideals of democracy and justice is hardly new. Generations of activists, scholars, and everyday people have fought and persevered to bring about social, cultural, and policy change.  This course engages deeply with topics relevant to the national discourse on racial and ethnic relations in the U.S. The first part of the course examines key concepts, focusing on the social construction of race and ethnicity, prejudice, and discrimination. The second part reviews the historical experiences of Native Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans. The third and final part of the course centers on four critical issues that are especially relevant in 2020: (1) immigration; (2) political disenfranchisement; (3) racial and ethnic disparities in health; and (4) racism in the criminal justice system."
HHS 20870,"Most Americans think of the “inner city” as a place of misery, danger, and despair. Why do most American cities have racially segregated areas dominated by concentrated poverty? What are the lives of inner city residents like? Why do the legal, political, economic, and educational institutions that serve these communities struggle so mightily to improve the lives of inner city residents? In this course, we will address all of these questions by viewing all five seasons of The Wire, David Simon’s epic tale of life in inner city Baltimore. Sociological theory and research will serve as powerful tools to help students “decode” The Wire, and better understand the social forces that create and sustain inner city poverty, violence, and disorder."
HHS 30014,"One way to improve our understanding of ourselves is to compare ourselves with the animals who most resemble us, in informative, challenging and disturbing ways. In this course, we'll look at the relationship that has done most to change human self-perceptions. With a focus on Western texts and experiences, but with reference to many other cultures, we'll concentrate on the problems of how and why human attitudes to other apes have changed since the Middle Ages, and how they have influenced thinking in science, religion, politics, sociology, literature, and ethics."
HHS 30111,"Disability has long been constructed as the opposite of higher education. Universities are places that valorize, even demand, physical and intellectual ability. Disability, in turn, is often seen as something that does not fit within a university context, a problem that must be fixed. This antithetical relationship between disability and the university is rooted in history—eugenical curriculums, research programs that study disabled people—but it continues today. Despite a growing focus on diversity in university admissions and populations, disabled students enter higher education at a lower rate than non-disabled students and are less likely to graduate. In addition, universities perpetuate cultures of ableism in both faculty and students by prioritizing ability, perfection, and achievement."
HHS 30119,"This class will survey the various historical and contemporary dimensions of Asian American experiences including immigration and integration, family and community dynamics, ethnic/gender/class identity, as well as transnational and diasporic experiences. We will explore contemporary and historical issues of racism, the model minority myth, inter-generational relationships, and the educational experiences of Asian Americans. To accomplish this, our class will pose such questions as: Who is Asian American? How did racism create Chinatown? Is there an Asian advantage? Coursework includes essays based on topics of your choice, presentations, and a creative narrative."
HHS 30192,"Sports play a big role in American culture. From pick up soccer and the Baraka Bouts to fantasy football and the Olympics, sports articulate American identities, priorities, aspirations, and concerns. They reflect our dominant values but also highlight our divisions and serve as a means to question those values. Athletes, organizers, spectators, fans, and the media all have a stake. This course will examine sport's role in American society and culture thematically, covering the late 19th century to present and paying special attention to sport as a physical performance (including issues of danger, drugs, disability, spectatorship, and fandom), sport as an expression of identity (the construction of race, gender, class, community, and nation), sport as a form of labor (with issues of power and control, safety, and amateurism), and sport as a cultural narrative (how do writers, historians, and the media attach meaning to it?). We will examine history, journalism, documentary film, and television coverage; topics will range from Victorian bicyclists and early college football to Muhammad Ali. Requirements include reading and regular discussion, a variety of short analytical papers, and a culminating project in which students will choose one course theme to analyze through a topic of their own choice."
HHS 30200,"What is psychic life? The word psyche has encompassed a range of definitions as it has travelled through time, from notions of mind, soul, spirit, and the conscious and unconscious mind, to a mirror, an asteroid discovered in 1852, a moth or butterfly, and anima mundi, the animating principle of the universe itself. Today an additional constellation of concepts may also be drawn into psyche's orbit, including brain, emotion, feeling, affect, self, subjectivity, person, ego, and experience. As opposed to terms like mental health, the concept of psychic life provides a language with which to speak about a range of phenomena across multiple traditions, epistemologies, and histories, without prioritizing any one conceptualization over another or locating the psyche within the boundaries of an individual mind, as distinct from the body and the world (Eileen Barany, cc:d here, has the full course description if you are interested)."
HHS 30308,"This course offers an in-depth analysis of the roles of structural and cultural violence in peace studies. Unit 1 (conceptual/theoretical) explores field-formative debates over the nature, basis, and viability of structural violence and cultural violence as analytical concepts, asking how they have shaped (or failed to, but perhaps ought to shape) the field of peace studies. We will examine their critical appropriations of early critical theory, and assess comparable theoretical approaches such as reflexive sociology (Pierre Bourdieu and Loic Wacquant), post-structural analysis (Michel Foucault), and later critical theory (Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth) while asking what advantages, if any, lenses of structural and cultural violence have vis-a-vis these resources for peace analysis and peacebuilding, and where they need to be supplemented. Unit 2 (cases/agents) studies cases in which some version of these analytical lenses have been deployed for purposes of peace analysis and peacebuilding. We examine recent uses of these lenses to examine poverty, global development, and global health in building peace (e.g. Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Paul Farmer, Peter Uvin), religious/cultural identity (Veena Das), and race, class, and gender (Joshua Price on incarceration and prison abolition in the U.S; Alex Mikulich and Laurie Cassidy on white complicity in hyper incarceration)."
HHS 30311,"The course will begin with a short history of the American health care system and will be followed by a discussion of the major components of the system (patients, providers, payers), health insurance coverage, managed care programs, the movement for quality health care, physicians in the changing medical marketplace, health care expenditures, and academic medical centers. This course counts as a general elective. Fall."
HHS 30424,"This course provides an overview of the complex ways in which gender and sexuality are relevant to a study of the state, both domestically and on the international stage. This course will look at the gendered and sexual dynamics of war, state-building, nationalisms, international governance, as well as feminist and queer social movement responses to the state."
HHS 30532,"An introduction to the economics of housing, with particular attention to issues of homelessness and the low-income housing market. Topics includes economic models of homelessness, housing subsidies and regulations, housing market filtering, concentrated poverty and neighborhoods effects, and public policy responses to housing problems."
HHS 30558,"This course is designed to introduce students to a wide range of health issues affecting women globally, with particular emphasis on Africa, Asia, and the United States. The topics will focus on a woman's life, from infancy and childhood, through adolescence and reproductive years, to old age. We will examine the physiological, social, psychological, economic, cultural, political, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence women's health, and the role of poverty, discrimination, and unequal health access. Topics such as determinants of women's health, reproductive health, sexual health, cardiovascular health, maternal health, cancers of the reproductive tract, mental and emotional health, substance use and abuse, and various forms of violence against women will be discussed. At the end of the course, students should have a solid grasp of key issues affecting the health of women in different cultural contexts globally, and how women can be empowered to take actions that positively influence their health."
HHS 30565,"This course examines how economic analysis can be applied to various components of the health care system. Microeconomic theory is used to understand the operation of health care markets and the behavior of participants (consumers, insurers, physicians, and hospitals) in the health care industry. International comparisons and the role of the public sector are discussed."
HHS 30605,"This course focuses on selected legal and policy issues related to K-12 education in the United States. A central theme is the intersection of K-12 schooling and the state, with a particular focus on Constitutional issues of religious freedom and establishment, student speech and privacy, parental choice, educational opportunity, and education reform trends such as charter schools and accountability measures. Questions examined over the course of the semester include: What are the most basic obligations of the state with regard to its regulation of K-12 education? What are the most basic rights of parents in this regard? In what ways does the 1st Amendment protect - and limit - the speech and privacy rights of K-12 schoolchildren? In what ways may the state accommodate K-12 schools with an explicitly religious character? What are the Constitutional requirements with regard to religious speech or expression within K-12 public schools? To what degree is the principle of equality manifest in the form of educational opportunity? How has this changed over time? In what ways have education reform trends such as charter schooling and increased accountability changed the policy landscape of K-12 education?"
HHS 30629,"This course covers the various issues relevant to the current early childhood education landscape. This includes theories of early learning and child development, policy development in the United States, the issues of inequality and the achievement gap, and research on interventions or what works in early childhood programming. The advantage to understanding the theories of child development, the policy context and the intervention research is that it gives future teachers and future policymakers a foundational premise upon which to grow, analyze, learn and teach. Topics covered will include: Theories of Child Development (Infant Schools to Present), Head Start and the CCDBG, State Preschool, Inequality and the Achievement Gap in the Early Years and Interventions in Early Childhood (HighScope/Perry Preschool, Abecedarian and Chicago Parent Studies, Head Start Research). The goal of this class is to come away with a greater understanding of the language, the history, the goals and the possibilities in this policy area as well as its connections to other social welfare programs and to K-12 schooling. Students will become more fluent in the language of early childhood education and will gain the foundational knowledge of past and current theories, laws, policies and educational interventions."
HHS 30800,"Almost 40% of the world's population is overweight or has obesity. Obesity has become a central focus in biological research as well as policy. Billions of dollars have been spent on public health interventions, biological interventions, diets, and exercise regimens. However, the obesity rate among adults and children has been steadily increasing globally. Why is this happening? How do we even define obesity? Does that definition truly reflect health? Why do we even have fat to begin with...actually what even is fat?!? Why are humans prone to obesity? These are just some of the questions we will address in this class. Using non-traditional methods and assignments, we will discuss adipose tissue and digestive physiology, the role evolution has played in the human propensity to hold onto fat, diet and exercise, food insecurity, therapeutic interventions, as well as the physical and mental health consequences of having obesity. We will use this as a basis to investigate the biological and cultural factors including stigma, race, and gender that shape our perceptions of body image and health in the midst of the obesity epidemic. Finally, this course will include occasional laboratory exercises to familiarize you with the methods used to assess body mass, body composition, metabolic rate, and point of care measures of biomarkers like glucose and cholesterol."
HHS 30856,"This course explores the relationships among and between workers, employers, government policymakers, unions, and social movements since the end of World War II, as well as the ways in which those relationships have shaped and been shaped by American politics and culture more broadly. The United States emerged from the Second World War as the globe's unequaled economic and political power, and its citizens parlayed that preeminence into a long postwar economic boom that created, however imperfectly, the first truly mass middle-class society in world history. At the heart of that new society was the American labor movement, whose leaders and members ensured that at least some of the heady postwar profits made it into the wallets of workers and their families - and not just the wallets of union members, as working Americans generally experienced great improvement in wages, benefits, and economic opportunity during the quarter-century ending in 1970. During those same years, civil rights activists challenged the historic workplace discrimination that kept African Americans at the bottom of the labor market, confronting the racism of employers, unions, and the government, and inspiring others, primarily Mexican Americans and women, to broaden the push for equality at the workplace. Since that time, however, Americans have experienced a transformation in the workplace -- an erosion of manufacturing and the massive growth of service and government work; a rapid decline in number of union members and power of organized labor; and unresolved conflicts over affirmative action to redress centuries of racial and gender discrimination. Meanwhile, income inequality and wealth disparities have grown every year over the past three decades. What accounts for the decline of organized labor since 1970, and why have the people of the mythic land of milk and honey experienced declining upward mobility and widening gaps between the rich and everyone else? Are these phenomena linked? What has the decline of the labor movement meant for workers specifically, and the American economy and politics more broadly? How and why have popular perceptions of unions changed over time? What has been the relationship of organized labor to the civil rights movement, feminism, modern conservatism, and the fortunes of individual freedom more broadly? What is globalization, and what has been its impact upon American workers? Through an exploration of historical scholarship, memoirs, polemical writings, and films, this course will try to answer these questions and many others. It will also address the prospects for working people and labor unions in the twenty-first century."
HHS 30910,"The aim of this class is to try to understand what conquest, as we have traditionally called it, meant to the people who experienced it in some parts of the Americas that joined the Spanish monarchy in the sixteenth century. We'll concentrate on indigenous sources - documentary, pictorial, and material - and try to adopt the indigenous point of view, without neglecting sources mediated by Europeans. Although the class will concentrate on selected cases from Mesoamerica, the lecturer will try to set the materials in the context of other encounters, both within the Americas and further afield; and students will be free, if they wish, to explore case-studies from anywhere they choose in the Americas (in consultation with the lecturer and subject to his approval) in their individual projects."
HHS 33613,"This course blends the History of Education and American Indian History and is open to students interested in action research on these two topics. The course may include an opportunity to collaborate on a project with a school that is part of the Native mission network schools and may include travel to a Native community. The class will feature some digital components, including the use of data analytics to formulate ideas about Native education in the United States. Students need no prior knowledge of this kind of work; even those with the most basic computer skills can learn how to use data to formulate important questions about education. "
HHS 40313,"This course provides grounding in some of the methods of qualitative analysis present in the field of anthropology. The focus of the course is on developing skills that students can use to do systematic analysis of anthropological data. The perspective guiding the course is that anthropology is an empirical, scientific approach for describing social and cultural aspects of human life, and that qualitative data can be analyzed in systematic and rigorous ways. The course will explore a range of approaches and will cover analytic skills that cut across traditions, including theme identification, code definition, and pattern recognition. Advanced topics covered will include content analysis, text analysis, and schema analysis. Students will learn techniques and protocols in data arrangement and visualization that are appropriate for different analytical methods. It is a hands-on class where students will be able to work on data provided to them as well as on their own. Collaboration will be integral to the course success."
HHS 43102,"This course will examine the health of Latinos in South Bend from an interdisciplinary perspective drawing on biology, medicine and cultural anthropology.  We will consider both the scientific bases of specific diseases affecting Latinos and the social, cultural, economic and environmental factors that increase risk and limit access to therapy. We will discuss topics such as antimicrobial resistance, chronic illnesses, labor-related afflictions, mental health and the effects of climate change on Latino well-being. We take seriously subjects' holistic, embodied understandings of suffering and their pragmatic quest for treatment across a pluralistic continuum from curanderismo to biomedicine. A critical analysis of health injustice and ways to cure this systemic dis-ease guide our class research, seminar discussions and scholarly goals. "
HHS 43318,"This course will survey a variety of philosophical issues pertaining to gender and feminism. Topics we expect to cover include the metaphysics of gender (e.g., the sex-gender distinction, the nature of masculinity and femininity, gender essentialism vs. gender constructivism); implicit bias and hermeneutic injustice; sexual harassment, violence, and the nature of consent; gender, feminism, and religion; and intersectionality."
HHS 43839,"America is the richest country in the world and yet roughly three million American children now grow up in families surviving on just $2 a day. As America's richest 0.1% have seen their incomes more than quadruple over the last forty years, the incomes for 90% of Americans have barely changed. These financial disparities reflect deeper inequities in educational opportunity, incarceration rates, social status and more. In this course, we will examine the nature and consequences of American inequality. Through close reading and spirited discussion, we will address such questions as: What is the meaning of meritocracy in an age of profound inequality? What is the lived experience of American poverty and American privilege? How are race and gender inequalities (re)produced throughout the life course? And, finally, how do all of these issues manifest in the successes and struggles of students at Notre Dame?"
HHS 46497,"Independent research or readings taken under the supervision of an HHS faculty member. An approved proposal for the research/readings will be filed with the HHS office.

HHS 50405,"Why is talking about climate change without reference to colonial pasts an incomplete conversation? Why is a forward-looking climate justice conversation incomplete unless it is also looking back? How does coloniality present today? How does the global south figure in writing on climate change? Can there be a role for the global south in the climate justice conversation that recognizes its vulnerability to climate change but goes beyond portraying it as always and only vulnerable, devastated and/or menacing? In this class we will begin with the premise that the answer is yes: not only is such a role possible, but it must actively be created if the climate justice conversation is to be an inclusive one. Examining representations of climate refugees, extreme weather events, and imagined geographies of conflicts, and informed by scholarship on racialized constructions of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ migrants, in this class we will collectively work through the intersections between the political and ecological that today determine the movement of humans, capital, and knowledge. Our collective endeavor will be to: (i) understand writing on climate change with a focus on its implicit (yet predominant) threat and risk imaginaries; (ii) question the role of the global south in such writing; and (iii) craft a lexicon that is cognizant of colonial pasts and their continuity, and relates geographies, histories and politics in more equal ways."
HIST 10750,"In the aftermath of 9/11, with American troops deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq, and concern about the nuclear ambitions of such nations as North Korea and Iran, national security is the phrase that is often discussed and is of crucial importance to informed citizens.  This course will examine national security policy: what it is, how it is formulated and executed, and how US national security policies have evolved since the 1890s.  Using a variety of readings and films such as Casablanca and Dr. Strangelove, this course will examine US national security policies from the late 1890s through two world wars, the interwar period, the Cold War, the post-Cold War years, and up to the current post-9/11 world.  We will identify continuities and departures in historic US national security policies, and consider the roles of policymakers and their critics in a self-governing society."

HIST 20052,"The gateway course will provide students with initial preparation and acquaint them with the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). More specifically, the course will introduce students to the historical milieu of MENA cultures and societies as well as the various dynamics that continue to shape them. It will survey the history of the region from the end of late antiquity to the present. Themes will include the rise of Islam; Muslim-Christian interactions; the caliphate; the age of gunpowder empires; engagements with modernity; encounters with European expansion; Islamic and secular reform movements; nationalism and revolution. "
HIST 20191,"This course is an introduction to the history of the peoples of Africa from the late nineteenth century to the present day. During the term, we will consider the ways in which Africans shaped and were shaped by the transformative events of the period. In the second half of the nineteenth century, European powers conquered and colonized much of the continent. Over the next sixty years, Africans lived and died under the yoke of European rule; some resisted, others collaborated, but all influenced the nature of colonialism and its eventual collapse. By the 1960s, most Africans were free of foreign rule. Since then the peoples of Africa have endeavored to achieve political stability, navigate Cold War politics, harness development aid, and adapt to a globalizing economy. In recent years, they have succumbed to brutal wars and endured devastating famines, but they have also inspired the world with their triumph over apartheid, emerging vibrant democracies, rich cultures, and deep history. In this class, we will identify, problematize, and debate these major themes in Modern African history. We also will make use of a variety of texts, from historical documents to classic academic works to works of African art, film, and fiction."
HIST 20200,"A survey of the central themes in Western civilization from ancient Mesopotamia to the Renaissance. Emphasis will be on problems of social organization, especially the mutual obligations and responsibilities of individuals and states; evolving concepts of justice; aesthetic standards; religious ideas and institutions; basic philosophical concepts; different kinds of states; and the ideologies that defined and sustained them."
HIST 20202,"We will proceed chronologically and learn abut the first seven centuries of Roman history, broadly speaking from the foundation of Rome (and the murder of Remus) to the murder of Julius Caesar and the civil war. For the foundation of Rome we will consider myths, historical writings and material evidence, then we will look at the evidence about the making of the Roman Republic, and of its destruction. Throughout the course, we will ask two main questions: how did the Romans manage to transform their small town into a world power in a few centuries? That is, why did the Romans and not any other people manage to conquer and unify the Mediterranean? Secondly, we will discuss the political social and cultural consequences of this transformation. These questions exercised the Romans themselves, and some of the responses they gave will be considered in light of current scholarship."
HIST 20355,"This lecture course examines some of the most important events, ideas, and personalities that shaped late Imperial, Soviet, and post-Soviet periods of Russian history during the last one hundred years: from the outbreak of the First World War and the Revolutions of 1905 and 1917 through the Great Terror of the 1930s, the experience of the Second World War and the emergence of the Soviet Empire, late Stalinism and post-Stalinist developed or mature socialism, the collapse of the communist rule and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, as well as Russia's uneasy transition out of Totalitarianism and into Putin's authoritarianism during the first fourteen years of the twentieth-first century. The course is designed for history majors as well as for students in other disciplines with or without background in modern Russian and East European history."
HIST 20451,"Scholars have long speculated about the rise of Asia, but Asia has already risen. Asian economies are driving global growth; Asian governments are some of the largest purveyors of foreign aid and investment; and Asian superpowers like China are shaping and shifting geopolitics. This course, taught by a political scientist and a historian, offers students the opportunity to unpack the complexity and diversity of Asia across time and space. We will explore Asia through political and historical concepts against the background of China's evolving role within the region. At the same time, we will focus on elevating diverse Asian voices to understand how historical concepts and political and economic trajectories have shifted over time and what it means for domestic and global audiences in the 21st century."
HIST 20901,"When Columbus stepped ashore in the Caribbean in 1492, he set in motion a process that led to the creation of wealthy Spanish and Portuguese empires in the Americas, the genocide of countless numbers of indigenous men and women, the enslavement of millions of African men and women, and the eventual formation of a variety of independent states competing in the world economy. In this semester-long survey, we will examine topics in this history that will allow us to consider how history is produced as well as what happened in the past, from various perspectives, from elite colonial administrators and merchants to indigenous peasants and formerly enslaved men and women."

HIST 30008,"This course examines the nineteenth and twentieth century histories of print and cultural manufacturing in the U.S., with special attention given to readers, writers, media producers, and distribution. By tracing how literature, broadly defined, has influenced the shape and reshaping of modern life, our primary goal for the semester will be to better understand the role and impact of intellectual transmission on civil society, formal politics, and cultural standards. Related topics we will investigate include the development and growth of American children's literature; the history of racial and ethnic authorship; the rise of industrial publishing; national and transnational censorship; and legacies of master communicators to mass audiences (e.g. Franklin Roosevelt with radio, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan with television, and Donald Trump with Twitter). Course readings and film screenings will range from William Llloyd Garrison's abolitionist newspaper, The Liberator, Matthew Rubery's The Untold Story of the Talking Book, Catherine Fisk's Writing for Hire: Unions, Hollywood, and Madison Avenue, James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time, Capote, and The Social Network."
HIST 30014,"One way to improve our understanding of ourselves is to compare ourselves with the animals who most resemble us, in informative, challenging and disturbing ways. In this course, we'll look at the relationship that has done most to change human self-perceptions. With a focus on Western texts and experiences, but with reference to many other cultures, we'll concentrate on the problems of how and why human attitudes to other apes have changed since the Middle Ages, and how they have influenced thinking in science, religion, politics, sociology, literature, and ethics."
HIST 30056,"This course will provide advanced undergraduates and graduate students with a critical introduction to digital humanities for the study of early China, the fountainhead of Chinese Civilization. Collaborating with the Center of Digital Scholarship, this course will focus on relational data with structured information on historical figures, especially high officials, of early Chinese empires. Throughout the semester, we will read academic articles, mine data from primary sources, and employ Gephi and ArcGIS to visualize data. Those constructed data will cover three major themes: how geographical mobility contributed to consolidating a newly unified empire over diversified regions; how social networks served as the hidden social structure channeling the flow of power and talents; and how criminal records and excavated legal statutes shed light on the unique understanding of law and its relationship with the state in Chinese history."
HIST 30057,"This course examines US engagement in hotspots across the Muslim world before and after 9/11. In particular focus are nations in South Asia and the Middle East: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq. We will also look at US relations with important Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, as well as policies toward Israel-Palestine and the Bosnian War in Europe. US engagement abroad takes many forms, including public diplomacy, trade, sanctions, alliances, covert operations, financial and military aid, and direct military intervention. What are the drivers of American decision-making in the region? Why is there so much anti-American sentiment in Muslim societies? Does peace depend on a critical reassessment of US foreign policy or the reform of a radical Islamist theology? Do certain interpretations of religion make conflict inevitable, or is it possible to attain reasonable outcomes even when dealing with extremists? Through a blend of history, investigative journalism, case studies, opinion polls, literature, and film, this course broadens our perspectives on some of America?s longest wars in the Muslim world."
HIST 30059,"What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films.  Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba)."
HIST 30087,"This course is on the religion, philosophy, and intellectual history of China and introduces the student to the worldview and life experience of Chinese as they have been drawn from local traditions, as well as worship and sacrifice to heroes and the cult of the dead. Through a close reading of primary texts in translation, it also surveys China’s grand philosophical legacy of Daoism, Buddhism, “Confucianism,” and “Neo-Confucianism.”"
HIST 30089,"Many Muslim thinkers and scholars have articulated the meaning and message of Islam in the modern period. This course will focus on one particular group of interpreters of Islam, namely the traditional or orthodox religious scholars called the Ulama and their institutions. This course will provide historical contexts in order to explore how traditional Muslims navigate the discourses of modernity and how they resist it. We will read original texts in translation and secondary sources of descriptions of representatives of the orthodox tradition in regions of Asia, the Middle East and in the West. The course will pay particular attention to the institutions of learning known as madrasas, jami` and hawzas. Of course, the orthodox views are challenged by other Muslims and some of those debates will also be channeled in the class while the focus will remain on the Ulama.  The course aims to equip students with analytical skills and the resources to understand how religious ideas impact religious communities and global affairs."
HIST 30105,"This CAD course looks back to 1850, when urban industrial America began, and looks forward to 2050, when Notre Dame promises to be carbon neutral, to critically engage competing visions of individual, communal, and ecological flourishing.  It focuses on economic, racial, and environmental justice as students explore how US political culture, the discipline of American Studies, and Catholic social teaching have clashed and converged and Americans proposed varying solutions to poverty, racism, and environmental degradation."
HIST 30171,"It is tempting to think that South Asia - home to nearly two billion people - is only now beginning to occupy global attention. But India has played a prominent part in global history for centuries. This course will span three millennia - from the Indus Valley civilization, to the time of Buddha, to the powerful Mughal Empire, two centuries of the British rule, the Gandhi-led freedom struggle, and ending with the recent histories of independent India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This introduction to India and South Asia will answer questions such as: Has there been an unbroken Indian civilization? How did a British company come to rule a vast Indian empire? How did India win its independence? What accounts for the region's poverty? Why are India and Pakistan separate countries today, with such divergent trajectories of democracy and dictatorship? And, finally, could India rival China and the United States in this century? South Asia is a place of extreme diversity and paradox: it can be confusing. However, its history offers us explanations. This course will offer an introduction and guide to the history of India's rich history, stormy politics, vibrant cultures, and globalized economies."
HIST 30201,"Violence and bloodshed have long been central to the modern conception of the middle ages. In recent film and literature, the perceived realism of a given work tends, by and large, to correspond directly with the willingness of the creators to depict brutality. Even in the medievalism of popular fantasy, the depiction of violence in all its varied forms, from the battlefield to the bedchamber, has been justified and excused by claims of representing past realities of common experience. This course will question just how violent the middle ages were, and for whom. More importantly, it will seek to understand how the varied cultures and peoples of medieval Europe conceptualized and understood violence themselves, and what role it played in their lives and imaginations. In the course of our investigation, we will explore literary narratives of vengeance and crusade and farcical tales of household bloodshed. We will read law codes and sermons attempting to regulate and channel violence. We will read accounts, justifications, and repudiations of torture, execution, and mercy. We will read about peace-making and peace-breaking, and the stories that were told about it. We will question what constitutes violence, and how violence relates to shifting categories of gender, class, and group identity. In all of this, we will seek to identify how the differences and similarities between their conceptions of violence and our own can teach us not only about them, but about ourselves."
HIST 30297,"The purpose of this course is to introduce students to major themes in the global history of slavery with a specific focus on the location of slavery in the making of the modern world bringing together histories from the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean worlds. The course will focus upon these themes through literature, economics, and politics. In addition, the course will also introduce students to recent museum exhibitions, art exhibitions, digital history projects, films, and documentary compilations that all together have transformed how the global history of slavery is understood. "
HIST 30304,"This course provides an in-depth introduction to the archaeology of ancient Greece, from the Bronze Age to the Early Classical Period (from the 16th to 5th century B.C.). The survey of material culture spans the ancient Aegean and traces its settlement formation and development, beginning with the Minoan and Mycenean civilizations. It explores Archaic and Classical Greece and introduces students to the analysis and interpretation of archaeological sites, monuments, artifacts and art, including the Panhellenic sanctuaries of Olympia and Delphi, and the Athenian Acropolis in the age of Pericles. Students learn how to evaluate the material culture of ancient Greece on the basis of historical and social context. In addition to exploring architecture, coins, inscriptions, sculpture, paintings, ceramics and other ancient material, students also consider the methods, results, and theory of archaeological research, in the areas of field excavation and intensive surface survey. Through the material record, the course attempts to reconstruct what life might have been like in ancient Greece."
HIST 30340,"This course is designed as a general introduction into the early and middle Byzantine period, focusing on the various aspects of transformation from the late Roman Empire to Byzantium at the end of the so-called ‘Dark Ages'. The main topics are the Christianization of the Empire and the separation between East and West; reactions to the barbarian migrations, the Slavic expansion, and the Islamic conquests; patterns of social and economic change; iconoclasm; Byzantine relations with the Carolingian and Ottonian Empires."
HIST 30407,"The Second World War is the largest single event in human history, fought across six of the world's seven continents and all its oceans. It killed fifty million human beings, left hundreds of millions of others wounded in mind or body and materially devastated much of the heartland of civilization. The above quote from historian John Keegan summarizes the significance of studying the Second World War. In this class, students will receive an introduction to the largest conflict in human history, from the origins of the war in Asia and Europe to the postwar settlements that continue to shape the modern world. Class content will focus on the military, diplomatic, and political narratives of the war, while exploring the lived experience of the war through primary source readings. This course satisfies the university history requirement and is open to all students; no previous knowledge of the topic is required."
HIST 30412,"England's seventeenth century provides one of the most compelling epochs of human history, full of a cast of remarkable characters. Once Elizabeth I died in 1603, a new dynasty, the Scottish royal house, the Stuarts, came to the throne in the person of James VI and I. A new political dynamic ensued. Insoluble tensions arose between perceived licentiousness in high politics on one hand and puritan moral rigour on the other, between royal control of religion and a hankering after policies based on literal Biblical interpretation and also between a gaping royal treasury and public reluctance to contribute financially to the realm. These, and other factors, resulted in the unthinkable: the dissolution of the ties that had held English politics and society together. The Civil War (or Great Rebellion, or Puritan Revolution depending on the interpretation favoured) that resulted gave rise to a welter of new constitutional ideas, religious experiments and virulent anti-Catholicism. These were all set loose as King and Parliament fought for domination of the country. We will pay particular attention to the figure of Oliver Cromwell, who came to command English politics both before and after the hitherto unimaginable public execution of the king (who many believed was God's anointed). We will also ask why the English after allowing their king to be executed and their toleration a substantial Interregnum subsequently restored Charles II, their erstwhile king's son, as monarch. Remarkable figures that we will encounter and evaluate include the Leveller John Lilburne, the poet John Milton, Praise-God Barebones (yes, that is a name) and the libidinous Samuel Pepys."
HIST 30445,"From the Plantation of Ulster in the early seventeenth century to today the hegemony, and later the survival, of native Irish culture in the Irish language has been challenged by English language culture. This course seeks, by analyzing primary sources in Irish (available to students in translation) in their historical context, to chart this process over time. The course also seeks to ask questions about the extent to which the Irish Catholic population resisted or collaborated in the process of anglicization that took place. Was the 'Sacsa nua darbh ainm Éire' /(New England going by the name of Ireland) culturally alien to the Irish population that resided in it"
HIST 30450,"Between 1643 and 1789, France underwent one of the most pivotal national transitions in modern European history. In the second half of the seventeenth century, Louis XIV reigned as the most powerful divine right monarch on the continent. He marshaled religious ideology, set cultural standards, pursued economic projects, and waged wars to consolidate his authority over the French and foreign powers alike. Yet, by the late eighteenth century, Louis XVI's crumbling crown gave way to the Revolution. The French ultimately dethroned the king and established a republic. Our class will explore how the French negotiated this tumultuous trajectory from subjects to citizens. We will analyze three main themes over the course of the Old Regime. First, we will wrestle with issues of modern state building including administrative reform, military campaigns, financial ventures, and expansion in the New World. Second, we will study the relationship among politics, culture, and religion as the French vacillated between critique and reform. Finally, we will probe the origins of the French Revolution. These sparks ranged from Enlightenment debates over contract theory and social privilege to the stresses of everyday life including taxes and food shortages. We will close as the revolutionaries imagined nascent citizenship on the eve of the republic. In sum, this course will ask: how did European democracy find its roots in an absolute monarchy? And how did generations of French work out this transition through their everyday lives?"
HIST 30454,"The French Revolution, along with the American Revolution, is often considered the founding moment of modern democracy. And yet, democracy was not achieved once and for all in 1789. Over the course of the next two hundred years, France went through five republics, two empires, two monarchies, and one (arguably) fascist regime. In addition, it took hundreds of years for the egalitarian promises of the revolution to be extended to all members of French society. This course tells the story of this ongoing experiment in democratic governance—one that continues to this day. It introduces students to the major themes in the political and cultural history of modern France from 1789 to the present, examining how the universalist promise of the Republic has been contested and reshaped through its encounter with colonialism, industrialization, the rise of radical ideologies, religion, war, feminism, and multiculturalism. Course materials are drawn from a variety of sources, including novels, manifestos, political cartoons, films, works of art and philosophy, as well as secondary works by historians."
HIST 30524,"Since the eighteenth century, Europeans have grappled with a number of transformative events and developments, from the French Revolution and the birth of an industrial economy, to catastrophic wars and the rise and fall of European empires. In the process of making sense of these events, they produced works of philosophy, political theory, art, and literature that continue to shape the way we understand our place in the world today. This course introduces students to the history of European thought from the Enlightenment to the present, a period that birthed the many great isms that have defined the modern world: liberalism, socialism, nationalism, feminism, existentialism, totalitarianism, and colonialism. Course readings will be drawn from a range of primary sources, including novels, works of philosophy, political treatises, films, and works of art, as well as secondary sources by historians. By reading these two kinds of sources together, we will explore not only how ideas and works of art were shaped by the historical context in which they were produced, but also how they themselves shaped the course of European history."
HIST 30621,"The Constitution holds a unique place in American law and political culture. Not only is it the basis of the federal government, it provides the framework for political debates about all manner of controversial issues in modern America. Today, there is much talk of a constitutional crisis in the United States. What does this mean? How can a history help us make sense of the Constitution and of our politics?  This course explores the historical context in which the American Constitution was framed, ratified, and amended over time. Together, we will ask and answer the questions of how and why it was written the way it was; how and why it gained legitimacy; and how it was put into practice and interpreted over time. The class will introduce students to central historical problems, which include: Is the American Constitution democratic? Did the Constitution codify slavery into law? Is originalism a useful and valid way to interpret the Constitution? Course readings will consist primarily of primary source material, though students will also read historical interpretations of the Constitution and the process of forming, amending, and interpreting it. The discussion-based class will empower students to think historically about the American Constitution by interpreting primary source material, building arguments about causes and effects of particular constitutional points, and intervening in scholarly dialogues about the founding and its legacy. Students will be evaluated primarily based on class participation, a short primary source analysis, a role-play activity, and a final paper. "
HIST 30634,"This course gives students the opportunity to learn more about how Americans have thought about criminal responsibility and how their ideas have changed over time. Historians contend that the 19th century witnessed a transformation in the understanding of the origins of criminal behavior in the United States. The earlier religious emphasis on the sinfulness of all mankind, which made the murderer into merely another sinner, gave way to a belief in the inherent goodness of humankind. But if humans were naturally good, how are we to explain their evil actions? And crime rates varied widely by sex and race; European women were said to have been domesticated out of crime doing. What do those variations tell us about a common human nature? The criminal might be a flawed specimen of humankind born lacking a healthy and sane mind. Relying in part upon studies done in Europe, American doctors, preachers, and lawyers debated whether insanity explained criminality over the century and how it expressed itself in different races and sexes. Alternative theories were offered. Environment, heredity, and free will were all said to have determined the actions of the criminal. By the early 20th century, lawyers and doctors had largely succeeded in medicalizing criminality. Psychiatrists now treated criminals as patients; judges invoked hereditary eugenics in sentencing criminals. Science, not sin, had apparently become the preferred mode of explanation for the origins of crime. But was this a better explanation than what had come before? Can it explain the turbulent debates in the late 20th and early 21st Centuries over variations in crime rates by race? Can it explain why men, not women, are still more likely to commit murder?  "
HIST 30638,"This course explores some of the critical questions and themes in U.S. Catholic history by examining how priests and nuns have been depicted, from the nation’s founding until today, in American art (including Thomas Nast’s cartoons and Paul Henry Wood’s painting, “Absolution Under Fire”), literature (including the lurid tale of Maria Monk and the short stories of J.F. Powers), television (including The Flying Nun’s Sister Bertrille and M*A*S*H’s Father Mulcahy), and film (including On the Waterfront, The Bells of St. Mary’s, Dead Man Walking, and Doubt). Tracing the evolution of cultural portrayals of priests and nuns illuminates how Catholics in the U.S. have been both feared outsiders and exemplary citizens, and how the Church in America has navigated encounters with nativism and anti-Catholicism; evangelization and ecumenism; immigration, industrialization, and urbanization; race, ethnicity, and civil rights; politics, diplomacy, and war; gender, sexuality, and sexual abuse; assimilation, secularization, and religious reform among many other topics."
HIST 30640,"Americans have long supported religious liberty under law, yet many also believed that only a religious people could guarantee the success of the Republic. Americans argued over how to define religious liberty, and over which particular religion best suited a republican government. Some said God had made certain people too inferior for citizenship, while others shot back that He had made all people equally capable. One man's piety was another man's oppression, one woman's equality another woman's blasphemy. We begin with the colonial era the concerns of the Revolutionary generation, look at the 19th Century's reform movements and new state institutions, then consider the Civil Rights movement of the 20th Century, and the place of religion in public schools. This discussion class will examine legal documents, like judges' rulings, and popular beliefs in political speeches and best-selling novels."
HIST 30653,"This course views the key question of American Studies—What does it mean to be an American?—through the lens of religion. Using two orienting themes—crossing and dwelling—it introduces students to the history of religion in the lands that became the United States. It focuses on how diverse peoples imagined and transformed the landscape, interacted with one another at different sites, and moved within and across borders. It is divided into four sections. We begin—and end—by asking: How should we tell the story of religion in America?  To help students prepare to answer that question on the last day of class, and to provide a variety of sources—from diaries and laws to images and films—the next three sections each introduce a different way to tell the story of U.S. religion: by chronology, tradition, or theme. Section two provides an historical overview, telling the story by tracing chronological shifts, including developments since the 1960s. The third section focuses on religious traditions that have flourished in the United States: Protestantism, Catholicism, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism, as well as Native American and African American traditions. In the course's final section we explore a series of topics or issues, including gender, sexuality, war, politics, literature, law, economy, science, and immigration. To accommodate different learning styles, we assess your progress in multiple ways, using both in-class and take-home assignments. Those include three short essays and an Intellectual Journal. Your last journal entry, which is your answer to the course's central question, will prepare you to contribute to our final session, when our class will collaborate to write our own account of the history of religion in America."
HIST 30700,"Sports play a big role in American culture. From pick up soccer and the Baraka Bouts to fantasy football and the Olympics, sports articulate American identities, priorities, aspirations, and concerns. They reflect our dominant values but also highlight our divisions and serve as a means to question those values. Athletes, organizers, spectators, fans, and the media all have a stake. This course will examine sport's role in American society and culture thematically, covering the late 19th century to present and paying special attention to sport as a physical performance (including issues of danger, drugs, disability, spectatorship, and fandom), sport as an expression of identity (the construction of race, gender, class, community, and nation), sport as a form of labor (with issues of power and control, safety, and amateurism), and sport as a cultural narrative (how do writers, historians, and the media attach meaning to it?). We will examine history, journalism, documentary film, and television coverage; topics will range from Victorian bicyclists and early college football to Muhammad Ali.  Requirements include reading and regular discussion, a variety of short analytical papers, and a culminating project in which students will choose one course theme to analyze through a topic of their own choice."
HIST 30762,"How did the most divisive war in American History shape the nation's biggest church community? This course explores Catholics as both supporters and detractors of the Vietnam War. American Catholics wished to see America defeat Communism but, importantly, the power of faith motivated many to criticize the state's escalation of the conflict. Students will explore the tensions and transformations of this important moment in American life. Lectures and classroom discussions will address decolonization, the global and national nature of American Catholicism, the power of the liberal state, conscientious objection, the Spirit of the Sixties, sacramental protests, the rise of human rights, geopolitics, and the Cold War. Course readings will include the latest scholarship, but also primary sources like poems, films, songs, letters, prayers, newspaper articles, and art. Students will have access to the rich materials of Catholic peace activists found in the University of Notre Dame Archives"
HIST 30856,"This course explores the relationships among and between workers, employers, government policymakers, unions, and social movements since the end of World War II, as well as the ways in which those relationships have shaped and been shaped by American politics and culture more broadly. The United States emerged from the Second World War as the globe's unequaled economic and political power, and its citizens parlayed that preeminence into a long postwar economic boom that created, however imperfectly, the first truly mass middle-class society in world history. At the heart of that new society was the American labor movement, whose leaders and members ensured that at least some of the heady postwar profits made it into the wallets of workers and their families - and not just the wallets of union members, as working Americans generally experienced great improvement in wages, benefits, and economic opportunity during the quarter-century ending in 1970. During those same years, civil rights activists challenged the historic workplace discrimination that kept African Americans at the bottom of the labor market, confronting the racism of employers, unions, and the government, and inspiring others, primarily Mexican Americans and women, to broaden the push for equality at the workplace. Since that time, however, Americans have experienced a transformation in the workplace -- an erosion of manufacturing and the massive growth of service and government work; a rapid decline in number of union members and power of organized labor; and unresolved conflicts over affirmative action to redress centuries of racial and gender discrimination. Meanwhile, income inequality and wealth disparities have grown every year over the past three decades. What accounts for the decline of organized labor since 1970, and why have the people of the mythic land of milk and honey experienced declining upward mobility and widening gaps between the rich and everyone else? Are these phenomena linked? What has the decline of the labor movement meant for workers specifically, and the American economy and politics more broadly? How and why have popular perceptions of unions changed over time? What has been the relationship of organized labor to the civil rights movement, feminism, modern conservatism, and the fortunes of individual freedom more broadly? What is globalization, and what has been its impact upon American workers? Through an exploration of historical scholarship, memoirs, polemical writings, and films, this course will try to answer these questions and many others. It will also address the prospects for working people and labor unions in the twenty-first century."
HIST 30907,"This is an interdisciplinary history course examining the Latino experience in the United States after 1848. We will examine the major demographic, social, economic and political trends of the past 150 years with an eye to understanding Latino/a America. Necessarily a large portion of the subject matter will focus on the history of Mexican-Americans, and Mexican immigrants in the Southwest and Midwestern United States, but we will also explore the histories of Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Latin-Americans within the larger Latino/a community. Latinos are US citizens and as such the course will spend significant time on the status of these groups before the law, and their relations with the state, at the federal, local, and community level. To explore these issues within the various Latino communities of the US we will explore the following key topics covered: historical roots of Latinos/as in the US; the evolution of a Latino/a ethnicity and identity within the US; immigration, transmigration, and the shaping of Latino/a communities; Latino/a labor history; segregation; civil rights; nationalism and transnationalism; the Chicano Civil Rights Movement; Latinos in film; and post-1965 changes in Latino/a life."
HIST 30910,"The aim of this class is to try to understand what conquest, as we have traditionally called it, meant to the people who experienced it in some parts of the Americas that joined the Spanish monarchy in the sixteenth century. We'll concentrate on indigenous sources - documentary, pictorial, and material - and try to adopt the indigenous point of view, without neglecting sources mediated by Europeans.  Although the class will concentrate on selected cases from Mesoamerica, the lecturer will try to set the materials in the context of other encounters, both within the Americas and further afield; and students will be free, if they wish, to explore case-studies from anywhere they choose in the Americas (in consultation with the lecturer and subject to his approval) in their individual projects."
HIST 30912,"This course is designed to introduce students to the modern history of “Greater Mexico” and its people. The emphasis on “greater” in the title is an attempt to complicate narrow ideas of the “nation” that generally exclude Mexicans residing in the United States or erroneously describe them exclusively as “immigrants.” The first two parts of the class pay particular attention to political and artistic movements that developed during the Porfiriato (1876—1910), the Revolution (1910—c.1940), and the post-revolutionary period (c.1938—1970s). The third part of the class continues on its emphasis on art, but also examines the role of youth and its response to the neoliberal period (1980s-present).   Students will examine what it meant to be a “militant” in the political world of artistic production and social movements in Revolutionary and “Greater Mexico” and the different ways in which the Mexican and American governments responded to this militancy. We will learn how and why a broad range of representative leaders of Greater Mexico’s most important political and cultural revolutions used paintings, murals, graphic art, photography, cartoons, music, graffiti, and especially film to (A) lead a social, cultural, and political restructuring of their respective communities; (B) export their unique notions of “Revolution” to the nation and to the world; and (C) question the contradictions that some artists (at times) faced within their own revolutionary movements in both the national and global contexts, from the revolutionary to the neoliberal period.  The success of the course relies on a combination of note-taking during the lectures, a willingness to analyze art (individually and collaboratively in group work), and a constant engagement during the class and group discussions."
HIST 30949,"We'll study what one might call the infrastructure of global history: the work of route-finders who led the dispersal of humankind into every habitable biome, then re-forged links between sundered cultures to make possible the world we inhabit today. Along the way we'll work on critical reading, unremitting perfectionism in writing, improved attentiveness in listening, and growing effectiveness in communicating. We'll focus on skills typically under-represented in students' education so far: how to identify and explore interesting problems in history and anthropology, and how to read texts from unfamiliar cultures by analyzing language and imagery."
HIST 30950,"The difference between rich and poor nations is not, as Ernest Hemingway once said, that the rich have more money than the poor, but is in part because the rich produce more goods and services. Industrialization, in other words, has often brought wealth (as well as social dislocation and protest) to those who have succeeded. This course examines the process of industrialization from a comparative perspective and integrates the history of industrialization and its social consequences for Western Europe (Britain and Germany), the United States, Latin America (Mexico), and East Asia (Japan and South Korea). We will concentrate on these countries' transition from agriculture-based societies to industrial societies. We will analyze the process of industrialization on two levels from above the role of political authority and from below a view of factory life, industrial relations, and protest from the perspective of workers and the working classes. No specific prerequisites in history or economics are necessary."
HIST 30951,"This interdisciplinary research lab enlists students in the efforts of the Just Wage Initiative (JWI), a collaborative research and advocacy project of the Higgins Labor Program at the Center for Social Concerns. Students will help develop, refine, and update the Just Wage Framework, a multistakeholder online tool designed to advance a more inclusive and equitable economy. Students will also undertake research projects connecting their own intellectual interests and disciplinary expertise to the JWI's foundational question: What makes any given wage just or unjust? In addition, students will collaborate with the instructor and local, national, and international practitioners to envision and execute collaborative research and advocacy campaigns to promote a just wage economy. Extended weekly class sessions will feature visits by scholars and activists, as well as facilitate interactive group discussions and collaborative experiments."
HIST 30985,"As the story often goes, much of human history was consumed by brutal religious conflict. This changed only during the Enlightenment, when Europeans began to embrace the virtue of tolerance, first of other Christians, and then of all religions and none. Though this sweeping narrative does capture a significant shift in the values upheld by the West, it smooths over the practical aspects of religious coexistence. Long before the rise of tolerance, communities have struggled to find ways to live with the religious other in their midst. Moreover, as modern history has proven time and again, even the highest ideals of tolerance do not nullify the friction created by contact between different faiths and creeds.  This course, therefore, considers the long history of toleration, both as it existed prior to the modern era, and how it has changed since the days of Spinoza, Locke, and Voltaire. Though our primary focus will be on Christianity, we will also discuss other models of coexistence practiced in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, as well as how these systems collided in the age of European colonialism. As we approach the present day, we will examine how toleration intersects with issues of racism, secularism, and fundamentalism, and ask whether historical experiences of coexistence have anything to teach us about how to live in peace with neighbors whose beliefs differ from our own."
HIST 32908,"This course introduces students to the diversity of cultures living in the American Southwest from the earliest Paleoindians (11,500 years ago) to European contact, the establishment of Spanish Missions, and the Pueblo Revolt of 1680-1692. Most of the course is devoted to learning about the complex cultural developments in the Mimbres Valley, Chaco Canyon, Mesa Verde, the Rio Grande, and the Phoenix Basin. Class work and discussions will focus on important issues such as the adoption of agriculture, the development of villages, the transformation of ideological beliefs and political organization, the importance of migration, and the impact of warfare using information on environmental relationships, technology, and other aspects of material culture. Students will also learn about descendant populations living in the Southwest today including the Pueblo peoples (e.g., Hopi, Santa Clara, Acoma) and Tohono O'odham."
HIST 33000,"This course is a requirement for - and open only to - History majors and minors. Designed as the gateway into the undergraduate history programs, History Workshop is a seminar that introduces students to how historians study the past by emphasizing active participation in the research and writing of history (not just reading what other historians have already written). Students gain insight into the nature of historical inquiry through discussion of how historians work, analysis of primary source documents from at least two different time periods and places, and, most importantly, their own efforts to write history via original interpretive historical essays."
HIST 35355,"In this course students will be introduced to the general narrative of the First World War. From there, we will examine three different topics and eventually show how they are interrelated. First, we will study historiography; that is, the evolution of how historians have written about and understood the First World War. Students will quickly learn how historians work with narrative and elements of story-telling both to explain and to argue (with and against one another).   Students will then study memorialization and public history work on the First World War. We will see how history-writing, literature, art, and memorialization are present in the way museums and memorials tell their own stories about trauma, heroism, social inequality, and - in the main - seek to impart understandings about the past.   Finally, taking the idea of narrative as a point for opening up our understandings of the past, we will then examine works of fiction, memoires, and poetry that focus on the First World War. The Great War was distinguished by being a People's War, which meant that all people of all classes fought side by side, farmers next to scholars, workers next to noblemen. There were thus many men (and women) involved in the war who were capable of recording what they saw and felt in both prose and poetry, leaving an extraordinary and unprecedented literary record of their experiences.  This course also includes a class trip to memorials and museums in Belgium, and France over fall break. We are working on funding from various sources to pay for most, if not all, expenses for this trip. This course requires an application to enroll. Students interested in the course should contact John Deak (jdeak@nd.edu) for a link to a google form."
HIST 35524,"Since the eighteenth century, Europeans have grappled with a number of transformative events and developments, from the French Revolution and the birth of an industrial economy, to catastrophic wars and the rise and fall of European empires. In the process of making sense of these events, they produced works of philosophy, political theory, art, and literature that continue to shape the way we understand our place in the world today. This course introduces students to the history of European thought from the Enlightenment to the present, a period that birthed the many great isms that have defined the modern world: liberalism, socialism, nationalism, feminism, existentialism, totalitarianism, and colonialism. Course readings will be drawn from a range of primary sources, including novels, works of philosophy, political treatises, films, and works of art, as well as secondary sources by historians. By reading these two kinds of sources together, we will explore not only how ideas and works of art were shaped by the historical context in which they were produced, but also how they themselves shaped the course of European history."
HIST 35637,"I but put that brow before you, Herman Melville wrote in his 1851 novel, Moby-Dick, read it if you can. Melville was describing the brow of the mighty sperm whale, but his words apply equally to his mighty book. In this seminar, we can and will read Moby-Dick, Melville's maddening masterpiece. We will read Moby-Dick as an invitation into its multiple historical contexts at the middle of the 19th-century American and wider worlds. We will explore the world of whaling and the age of sail, the ecological and imaginary expanses of the 19th-century ocean, the intellectual and literary culture of the American Renaissance, and a nation on a collision course with itself."
HIST 35650,"This course will examine the long history of struggle for civil rights by the Latina and Latino communities. Representing an estimated 65.3 million residents of the United States, the demographic is the largest minority group. However, their experiences represent a clear paradox. Despite their “American” identity, they remain “Others” to many in the United States. Beginning with the forceful incorporation of ethnic Mexicans in the mid-nineteenth century, this course covers the triumphs and failures of collective action by this community for a variety of rights and access on their path to inclusion. These include workplace strikes for equal pay, unionization drives, walkouts against educational discrimination, interfaith alliances for immigration rights, and more. Through covering various topics, this course documents the strategies Latinas and Latinos utilized in their social movements and negotiates the consequences of those tactics and their lasting influence in their communities. In these struggles for equality, Latinas and Latinos advocated for educational reform, reshaped public space, and influenced the negotiations of their place in society."
HIST 35978,"This course examines the Global Sixties (c.1956-c.1976) with particular attention to politics, culture and religion in the United States, Western Europe, and Latin America. The emphasis will be placed primarily on the topics of youth activism and state repression from the perspective (and influence) of the Global South. The main goal of the course is to provide an opportunity for extensive reading in the Global Sixties historiography. For this, it pays particular attention to influential primary texts, ideas, interpretations, ideological currents, and repercussions of the period with emphasis on the broader context of the Cold War. Additional and more specific goals include: (1) exploring the different approaches and methods that historians have used to interpret the history of the Global Sixties; and (2) providing methodological background and advice that will aid students to write original research papers."
HIST 35995,"This course will explore the origins of the Second World War from 1919 to 1941. Students will engage in the major historiographical debates on the origins of the war, including the Treaty of Versailles, the rise of Hitler, the militarization of Japan, and the question of appeasement. Students will gain an appreciation of the complex interwar political and social environment while wrestling with questions of causation, structure and agency in history."

HIST 53002,"This course, open only to students in the History Honors Program, introduces students to some of the most exciting debates over how history should be conceptualized and written.  Any thesis writer seeking to add to our understanding of the past needs to grapple with what history is for and what constitutes proper historical knowledge.  This seminar will help students ask these larger questions and then use their answers to sharpen and shape their own projects.  The emphasis of the class will be on understanding how historians have framed research questions, developed criteria for judging evidence, and then created compelling arguments."
HIST 53605,"This colloquium is designed to acquaint graduate students with colonial North American / United States history and historiography from roughly 1450 to 1865. The course will revolve around discussion of common assigned readings. Essays and other scholarly undertakings, based on these readings, will also be required."
HIST 58003,"History Honors Program students only.  In the fall and spring of the senior year, the history honors student will work on a thesis (40 to 80 pages) under the supervision of a specific faculty member."
HIST 60020,"This graduate seminar focuses on the work of the Frankfurt School, a highly influential group of twentieth century intellectuals who sought to investigate the unique challenges posed by capitalism, totalitarianism, modern bureaucracy, and mass politics. Influenced by Hegel, Marx, Weber, Nietzsche and Freud, they drew from a wide array of disciplines and theoretical approaches in an effort to diagnose the pathologies of modernity. Their studies, known as Critical Theory, were among the first that can be properly labeled interdisciplinary, encompassing insights from philosophy, aesthetics, political science, psychology, sociology and economics, among other fields. We will read the works of Georg Luka´cs, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse and Ju¨rgen Habermas, as well as more recent critical theorists. The seminar will consider the strengths and limitations of Critical Theory through close readings of the school's key texts. Some familiarity with ‘modern' social theory, particularly Kant, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche and Weber, is useful but not necessary."
HIST 60210,"This course is intended for MTS students and makes them acquainted with major developments of early modern and modern theological and philosophical thought, roughly from the Reformation to the 20th century. Figures who will be discussed include Erasmus, Spinoza, Teresa of Avila, Kant, and topics like theories of modernity (e.g. Hartmut Rosa)."
HIST 63041,"Medieval religious professionals--Rabbis, Priests, and Imams--often found themselves engaging with the beliefs and texts of religious others, whether they were opponents within their own faith traditions or outside it.  Moreover, a vast literature of religious polemic and apologetic survives from this period in many languages. This course will explore a number of such works, as well as influential recent scholarship on apologetic and polemic.  Students will write a twenty to thirty page research essay."

This course is required for all first-year students."
HIST 83002,"This seminar serves as an introduction to balancing the range of professional commitments pursuant to a career as an academic historian. Topics will vary from semester to semester, but some of those covered include research, teaching, administrative responsibilities, classroom and student problems, conduct, publication, seeking employment, career alternatives, and time management. All second-year graduate students in history are required to pass this course in the fall semester as they become teaching assistants. Attendance, preparation, and participation are required."
HIST 83005,"In this seminar, required for second-year history graduate students, students will focus on three skills that are crucial for the professional historian: research, writing, and publishing. Through engagement with core texts in historical methodology and exemplary texts in their fields, students will acquire an understanding of professional standards and strategies in our guild. They will also be required to complete two major writing assignments. First, they will complete a full first draft of their dissertation proposal. Second, they will complete a draft of an article or conference presentation that they intend to submit to a major journal or conference in their field. Students will complete these projects in consultation with the course instructor and their advisors, and through regular workshop sessions in collaboration with their peers."
HIST 83215,"In 1851 the French scholar Ernest Rénan wrote: one can say without exaggeration that the problem of the origins of Islam has definitely now been completely resolved. In 2023, however, scholars are more divided than ever over the question of Islamic origins. Rénan's confidence stemmed from the appearance in his day of medieval Muslim biographies of Muhammad, which in their detailed descriptions of the Muslim prophet seemed to offer reliable historical data. Yet they are also late sources. The earliest Islamic biographies date from approximately 150 years after the traditional death date of Muhammad (632). Otherwise scholars work with the Quran—a text marked by Biblical allusions and religious exhortation, not historical narratives—with the early Greek, Syriac and Armenian literature (primarily Christian) that alludes to the rise of a new religious movement in the Near East, and with the pre-Islamic and early Islamic rock inscriptions in and around the Arabian peninsula. All four sources—classical Islamic sources, the Quran, early non-Muslim literature, and epigraphy —present particular interpretive challenges. In this seminar we will address the question of Islamic origins by appreciating the particular types and functions of these sources. At the same time we will examine the debate over these sources in recent scholarship, with particular attention to the theories of those who argue that the origins of Islam are closely related to the development of Christianity in the Late Antique Near East. This seminar is an examination of a movement (Islam) that is closely connected to Christianity, and of a text (the Quran) that itself claims to present the proper interpretation of Biblical narratives. Students are not assumed to have any special background in Islamic Studies or Arabic. They will be asked, however, to read carefully and to engage in active class discussion."

HIST 83670,"This seminar will introduce students to the major historiographical questions and scholarly interpretations of modern Russia, from the reign of Nicholas II, the last of the Romanovs, beginning at the end of the 19th century to the collapse of the communist dictatorship and the disintegration of the Soviet Empire under Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980-early 1990s. We will pay particular attention to the following issues: the results of the extremely rapid transformation of the economy and society; the limits of state power; youth and revolution; Stalinist political culture; nationalism, ethnicity, and empire; terror and repression; Marxist ideology and the Leninist legacy; the cult of personality and everyday life; and comparisons with other modern dictatorships."
HIST 83680,"This seminar is an introduction to the ways that historians approach and use archives, which are not mere repositories of information but professional institutions that manage limited extant documentation in proscribed ways. For historians of minoritized populations -- Indigenous peoples, those enslaved in the Atlantic trade, non-elite women -- historical documentation might ignore, elide, or misrepresent subjects, and archives and libraries might do little to change that visibility. We will look at the vigorous academic critique of archives as sites of power -- from Michel-Rolph Trouillot to Black scholarship on digital archiving and beyond -- as well as visit museums, archives, landscapes, and libraries to have dialogues with professionals about those challenges. Most course content will draw from the Latin American and Caribbean experience, and will emphasize the histories of enslavement, gender, Black subjectivity, and Indigenous peoples."

HIST 93605,"We live in a world where much of the planet's population either lives in developing economies and/or in capitalist economies of different stripes. Whether at meetings of the World Trade Organization or the United Nations, the question of inequality (within nations, and between global North and South) continues to frame international politics. This graduate course will provide historical explanations of how we arrived at this juncture. It will do so by examining a range of historically minded scholarship on the subject of capitalism and development in the modern world. The themes covered will include debates over the causes of the Great Divergence in wealth between the West and the rest of the world; slavery and capitalism; the effects of colonialism in Africa and Asia on development; the nature of postcolonial development in the twentieth century; the influence of the Cold War on international institutions and social science; the rise of neoliberal thought; and finally, contemporary debates about globalization."

HPS 60036,"Neoplatonic philosophy is one of the or maybe even the most influential intellectual movement in Late Antiquity, the Middle Ages and into modern times. Neoplatonic ideas shaped philosophical, theological, mystical and literary texts and art and architecture. The course will study a wide range of Neoplatonic texts and of texts inspired by Neoplatonism from Antiquity into the Middle Ages, including the Byzantine, Latin and Arabic tradition. As the intellecutal basis of the course, we will first study pagan Neoplatonism in late Antiquity. We will focus mainly on the founder of Neoplatonism Plotinus who transforms Platonic thought and combines it with Aristotelean ideas without neglecting Stoic input as well. Later developments in Neoplatonism will be dicussed as well, since they are the basis of Christian transformations of Neoplatonism (e.g. Porphyry, Proclus). Then we will move to the first Christian transformations of Neoplatonic thought in late Antiquity, especially Dionysius the Areopagite, but also Boethius and Augustine. After a briefer detour to Neoplatonism in Byzantium we will focus on the neoplatonic traditions in the Middle Ages, focusing especially on the first translations of Dionysius the Areopagite and his reception in philosophy, theology, mysticism and art. Furthermore, we will take a look at the Arabic tradition.Topics dicussed in the course will include: 1) The Good, the One and God; 2) Intellect; 3) Soul; 4) Self, person, self-consciousness; 5) the intelligible realm and the visible world; 6) body; 7) matter 8) evil; 9) freedom; 10) the ascent of the soul and the union with the divine; 11) art and its anagocial powerMost texts will be read in translation, but we will also look at selected passages in Greek or Latin (for those who read these languages; they are not a requirement for the course).

HPS 80000,"This course will engage students in the art and craft of writing for the public. Students will closely analyze works of creative nonfiction (personal essay, memoir, op-eds, columns, and long-form narrative journalism) by scholars and public intellectuals from across the Humanities, Social Sciences, and STEM fields that were written not for scholarly, peer-reviewed journals, but for blogs, online newsletters, and general audience magazines. Textual analysis will be undertaken with an eye toward the structural, stylistic, and rhetorical decisions made by the writers, in order for students to expand their own understanding of what is creatively possible for them as scholars and writers, and what is possible when it comes to the real-world impact of scholarly research. Course readings will be treated as literary texts whose intent is to educate, elucidate, and raise awareness in the general public (i.e. those outside of the discipline-specific discourse communities scholars tend to inhabit) about issues that the general reader might not have access to or feel intimidated by. Analysis of the readings will in turn provide models and motivation for students to write their own works of nonfiction connecting their scholarly interests to public concerns."

HPS 83668,"What is the relationship between God and Mammon? As AMC Waterman argues, political economy arguably displaced theology as the center of public discourse by the 19th century. Theologians thus need to engage with economics. The question is how? In this course we will begin with some basic principles of economics, with attention to the anthropology that tacitly undergirds the discipline. We will look at some of major economic texts (Smith, Malthus, Becker). Then we will turn to the Christian tradition to examine its engagement with economic questions, beginning with scripture and the Church fathers, continuing through Aquinas and the reformation, and ending with the Anglican theologians who played a role in launching economics as an independent discipline. The course will conclude with Stephen Long's Divine Economy, which surveys the modern field of theology and economics."
HPS 83801,"Science occupies a prominent place in our society. Science, it is said, secures knowledge that other endeavors cannot possibly obtain, and it can transform the world in radical ways. But what is the nature of scientific knowledge? What makes science so special? This survey course is an introduction to the philosophical debates about the nature of modern science. We will cover the central issues in the philosophy of science from logical empiricism to contemporary debates. Topics included in the survey are: the nature of scientific knowledge; progress in science; realism and antirealism; reductionism; laws of nature; explanation and confirmation; the nature of scientific practice; the role of values in shaping scientific research."
HPS 90524,"Since the eighteenth century, Europeans have grappled with a number of transformative events and developments, from the French Revolution and the birth of an industrial economy, to catastrophic wars and the rise and fall of European empires. In the process of making sense of these events, they produced works of philosophy, political theory, art, and literature that continue to shape the way we understand our place in the world today. This course introduces students to the history of European thought from the Enlightenment to the present, a period that birthed the many great isms that have defined the modern world: liberalism, socialism, nationalism, feminism, existentialism, totalitarianism, and colonialism. Course readings will be drawn from a range of primary sources, including novels, works of philosophy, political treatises, films, and works of art, as well as secondary sources by historians. By reading these two kinds of sources together, we will explore not only how ideas and works of art were shaped by the historical context in which they were produced, but also how they themselves shaped the course of European history."
HPS 90791,"This graduate seminar brings together two subfields of inquiry—science fiction studies and the inscriptional studies of science and technology—and two questions—how is science written in fiction and how is writing used in science—to account for the ways in which writing and science are, and have been historically and culturally, entangled. No prior knowledge of any subfield is required. You will read and engage with scholarship from literary criticism, history of science, science studies, and media technology studies. Students will likely encounter work from the likes of Thomas More, Fredric Jameson, Darko Suvin, Octavia Butler, Samuel Delany, Bruno Latour, Hans-Jörg Rheinberger, N. Katherine Hayles, and Friedrich Kittler."
HPS 93605,"We live in a world where much of the planet's population either lives in developing economies and/or in capitalist economies of different stripes. Whether at meetings of the World Trade Organization or the United Nations, the question of inequality (within nations, and between global North and South) continues to frame international politics. This graduate course will provide historical explanations of how we arrived at this juncture. It will do so by examining a range of historically minded scholarship on the subject of capitalism and development in the modern world. The themes covered will include debates over the causes of the Great Divergence in wealth between the West and the rest of the world; slavery and capitalism; the effects of colonialism in Africa and Asia on development; the nature of postcolonial development in the twentieth century; the influence of the Cold War on international institutions and social science; the rise of neoliberal thought; and finally, contemporary debates about globalization"

IDS 20500,"An introduction to the field of international development, with particular focus on the various disciplines that have contributed to and shaped the development discourse. Readings, lectures, and discussions will draw from various disciplines, including economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, environmental and technological sciences, public health, law, and gender studies, among others. We will examine debates on the meaning and measurement of development; alternative approaches to, and methods in, the study of development; and attempts to address some of the main development challenges facing the world today. There will be a central focus on understanding what works in development. Working together in teams, students will conceptualize and design an international development project using real world constraints."
IDS 30421,"The difference between rich and poor nations is not, as Ernest Hemingway once said, that the rich have more money than the poor, but is in part because the rich produce more goods and services. Industrialization, in other words, has often brought wealth (as well as social dislocation and protest) to those who have succeeded. This course examines the process of industrialization from a comparative perspective and integrates the history of industrialization and its social consequences for Western Europe (Britain and Germany), the United States, Latin America (Mexico), and East Asia (Japan and South Korea). We will concentrate on these countries' transition from agriculture-based societies to industrial societies. We will analyze the process of industrialization on two levels from above the role of political authority and from below a view of factory life, industrial relations, and protest from the perspective of workers and the working classes. No specific prerequisites in history or economics are necessary."
IDS 30423,"African peoples and empires have always been at the heart of transformative world events. Their wealth, ingenuity, and power reshaped the medieval global economy. Their enslavement and back-breaking forced labor fueled industrial and agricultural revolutions. Their struggle against western racism and imperialism awakened pan-African consciousness. And today, their creativity and entrepreneurialism drive popular culture and economic opportunity. In this course, we will explore the many ways Africans shaped the history of the world. We will do so by examining primary documents, reading African fiction, watching African films, and immersing ourselves in current trends in Africa.  "
IDS 30513,"This class aspires to develop relevant knowledge and practical skills for students interested in engaging in positive change in a complex world. In this course on international development, students will: 1) examine the processes that bring about individual and societal change in an international context;2) explore the roles, complexities, opportunities and constraints of development projects in areas such as poverty reduction, social development, health and education; and, 3) develop practical skills related to project design, planning, management, negotiations, communications, and the evaluation of international development projects.  A central theme of the course is to understand what have we learned over the past decades from systematic research and from experience in the field about what works.  The course makes use of cases studies and draws lessons from instructive stories of failure as well as inspirational stories of change. The course focuses significant attention on bright spots in development- specific interventions that have made meaningful contributions. The course aspires to help train students to think like creative, effective, and thoughtful development professionals.  A central feature of the course will be the opportunity to work throughout the semester as a member of a Development Advisory Team directly with an international development organization client who has identified a specific problem or opportunity. Development clients for the class are organizations in Bangladesh, Chile, Haiti, and India, among others."
IDS 30552,"Social Entrepreneurship has sparked dialogue and debate for two decades. Its very definition is much debated, as well as its capacity to create sustainable, scalable, systems-changing impact. This course explores the theoretical concepts, practices and strategies associated with the dynamic discipline of social enterprise and innovation. For our purposes, social entrepreneurship is the landscape, of which paradigm-shifting solutions like microfinance, MSME (Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise) development, bottom of the pyramid, fair trade, impact investing, and the like, are components. This course will study many of these concepts, focusing on their opportunity for social impact, and as a vehicle for wealth creation in vulnerable and disenfranchised communities across the globe. Further, the course covers examples of various social enterprise models (for-profit, non-profit, hybrid), requiring students to analyze and devise strategies to improve the efficacy of these ventures. Finally, the course engages students in research seeking to advance the field of social entrepreneurship at the Keough School of Global Affairs and Notre Dame. "
IDS 30558,"This course is designed to introduce students to a wide range of health issues affecting women globally, with particular emphasis on Africa, Asia, and the United States. The topics will focus on a woman's life, from infancy and childhood, through adolescence and reproductive years, to old age. We will examine the physiological, social, psychological, economic, cultural, political, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence women's health, and the role of poverty, discrimination, and unequal health access. Topics such as determinants of women's health, reproductive health, sexual health, cardiovascular health, maternal health, cancers of the reproductive tract, mental and emotional health, substance use and abuse, and various forms of violence against women will be discussed. At the end of the course, students should have a solid grasp of key issues affecting the health of women in different cultural contexts globally, and how women can be empowered to take actions that positively influence their health."
IDS 30588,"Students, in a structured format, are involved in assessing, prioritizing and creatively solving problems encountered by low-income and other disadvantaged South Bend entrepreneurs. A process consulting approach is employed and a number of useful tools and frameworks are introduced. Students work with both for-profit and non-profit enterprises, producing tangible deliverables that help clients launch, grow and sustain their ventures. In addition to class time, students will meet with clients on a weekly basis at a Notre Dame facility located downtown. Assistance with transportation will be available for students needing it. Class will meet on Tuesdays. On Thursdays, students will consult with local entrepreneurs in one hour blocks during the hours of 5p to 9p at the Center for Civic Innovation. This consulting time is flexible with students' schedules and based on appointments made by local entrepreneurs."
IDS 30589,"Do you want to learn how to solve problems that matter? Human Centered Design (HCD) is an empathetic tool that utilizes guided questioning related to product, service, or systems innovations to identify opportunities for sustainable, human-centered impact. For example, how might we design a cookstove that reduces the amount of smoke inhaled by a community member? How might we design a new service engaging low-income borrowers in rural communities? How might we design a system linking social innovators and their innovations to users across the globe in a manner that encourages collaboration and sharing of resources? Whether a social innovator is designing in the private, public or nonprofit sector, HCD provides a valuable framework, deeply rooted in empathy, and is an excellent methodology for social innovators who want to problem solve and design alongside communities. In this course students will be introduced to the HCD toolkit and will apply it in practice, either in a domestic or international context. This fast-paced course will take students through the HCD cycles of inspiration, ideation and implementation, and provide opportunities for student and community collaboration."
IDS 30600,"This rigorous, hands-on, interdisciplinary seminar prepares students to design and execute an independent international field research project. The course enhances your ability to conduct your own research, but also teaches techniques that will be useful for the rest of your academic studies, and for understanding research results presented to you through popular press in your life after college. This class is unique because throughout, your learning and work are geared specifically to your selected research interests. The first part of the class guides students through the steps of refining a research project and preparing a research proposal. The second part of the class will help students hone their ability to conduct research through a series of research practicums: students get hands-on experience in a variety of methodological approaches through research conducted in the local area. Because of the over-arching nature of the course, we will touch on topics of research design, such as developing a research question, a theoretical framework, and hypothesis testing, as well as analysis of data and evidence. However, we encourage students to see this course as a complement, rather than a substitute, for discipline specific research methods and analysis courses. "
IDS 30833,"The goal of the course is to compare the processes by which social scientists and filmmakers/photographers engage in social documentation. Students explore how global social problems such as rural and urban poverty, race and gender inequalities, immigration, and violence are analyzed across the social sciences and depicted in a variety of documentary film and photography genres. The course also explores the role that documentary photography and film play in promoting rights and advocating for social change, particularly in the realm of human rights and global inequality. It examines the history of documentary film and photography in relationship to politics and the development of concerns across the social sciences with inequality and social justice. It also looks at how individual documentarians, non-profit organizations, and social movements use film and photography to further their goals and causes as well as issues of representation their choices raise. The course is unique because it requires students to engage in the process of visual documentation themselves by incorporating an activity-based learning component. For their final project, students choose a human rights or social problem that concerns or interests them (and which they can document locally - no travel is required), prepare a documentary exhibit on the chosen topic (10-12 photographs), and write an essay analyzing how social scientists construct and frame the given problem. Students also have the option to produce a short documentary film."
IDS 30835,"The course adopts an entrepreneurial perspective in exploring the role of business in helping to address the poverty challenge in developing and developed economies. The multi-faceted nature of poverty and its implications when it comes to business and entrepreneurship are explored. Attention is devoted to venture creation as a pathway out of poverty, and to how the larger business community can be leveraged in poverty alleviation efforts. Students will examine case studies and meet low income entrepreneurs."
IDS 30843,"Market-oriented reforms known as ‘neoliberalism’ have dominated the reform agenda across the world. These reforms were passed amidst tremendous political contestations and have delivered varying degrees of success. For the developing countries that faced the additional/simultaneous challenges of building ‘good’ institutions and governance systems, these reforms have resulted in questionable outcomes. Given this, today’s emerging economies have been forced to re-assess the benefits of market-oriented reforms, and those with policy space and political will/capacity have embarked on new reform experiments. The module introduces the students to the complexities and challenges of economic reforms in the fast-growing economies by placing politics at the heart of the analysis. The course is comprised of two parts. The first part provides the theoretical and conceptual foundations for examining the processes and outcomes of economic reforms. It discusses the limitations and dangers of designing and implementing reforms without consideration of the broader concept of states and markets or sufficient engagement with politics. This is because policy always produces new winners and losers, and as a result provokes resistance from those who believe they will lose wealth, status, or power. The second part investigates reforms in key areas of the political economy where there have been significant reforms and where distributive tension and conflicts are rampant. These include privatization, trade liberalization, industrial policies, debt and macroeconomic stabilization, tax and fiscal, and social policy reforms, food and nutrition, among others. Given the importance of national and regional contexts when discussing politics, the course draws cases from a wide range of geographical areas including East Asia, Latin American and Sub-Saharan Africa. The module concludes by examining the implications of factoring politics and local contexts into economic reforms for development policy and management and discusses whether new development paradigms and models exist for emerging economies."
IDS 30844,"Enrolling in school does not guarantee that children acquire the human capital that their schooling should provide. Also, in some countries a large fraction of children still are not finishing primary school, and there are still millions of children who never attend school at all. In this course, we will review the impact of various types of educational interventions on schooling in the Global South. We explore the rationale behind specific policies and the evidence (or lack of) in support of their effectiveness in improving education outcomes. The aim is to engage in broader debates on the challenges facing effective education policy. Students will critically evaluate real-life policy options in different contexts, as well as propose potential innovations. By the end of the course, students will possess an analytical framework that allows them to think clearly about the impacts of alternative education policies, as well as be able to judge the quality of existing evidence."

Nevertheless, we have also witnessed the emergence of sophisticated civil society networks and social movements to address these challenges, as well as governmental and transnational institutions committed to promoting justice and peace at the local, national, regional and global levels. This course introduces students to the various ways scholars and activists define peace and the challenges faced in securing peace. It surveys: (1) the major causes of direct and structural violence; (2) various definitions of peace and the conditions under which it occurs and is sustained; and (3) the comparative success of various strategies such as building peace movements and promoting nonviolent social change"
IIPS 20501,"This course provides an introduction to the study of international relations and will cover several theoretical approaches to and empirical issues in the field of IR. Readings have been selected to highlight both traditional approaches to and more recent developments in world politics. The first half of the course focuses on contending theories of IR, while the second half of the course deals with more substantive issues. Empirical topics and subjects covered include: international security (nuclear weapons, ethnic conflict, and terrorism) - international political economy (trade, international finance, and globalization) - and 20th Century History (WWI, WWII, and the Cold War). In addition, we will examine several contemporary topics in international organization and law, including the environment, nongovernmental organizations, and human rights. We conclude by discussing the future of international relations in the 21st Century."
IIPS 20506,"Reconciliation is increasingly becoming a popular notion in our time, finding its way into the political rhetoric and public policy of many governments. South Africa and its apparently successful Truth and Reconciliation Commission have captured the imagination of many post conflict societies (including nations like Rwanda, Bosnia, Northern Ireland and communities in the United States as they debate the merits and possibility of similar reconciliation efforts in their communities. Interest in reconciliation in the academic world has also increased, with scholarship on the topic and with institutions setting up reconciliation studies as a specialization sub field in the growing world of peace studies. It is perhaps not surprising that reconciliation has become a popular buzz world. The end of the cold war did not usher in a new world order of peace that many had hoped for. On the contrary, war, conflict and violence seem to be on the rise in a world marked by growing polarization between religious, ethnic and national identities. In the midst of such a fragmented and broken world, reconciliation is a rallying cry for some hope of healing, conflict resolution and solidarity among peoples. However, even as reconciliation has become popular, its meaning has remained vague, and its theological connections even more unclear. What difference if any does one's Christian faith make in the way one understands or pursues reconciliation? What's the Christian understanding of reconciliation anyway? What is the relation between reconciliation with God, and reconciliation in its social, political and economic dimensions? Why has Catholic discussions on reconciliation so much focused on the sacrament of reconciliation and not paid as much attention to the notion of social reconciliation? The course seeks to answer these and similar questions."
IIPS 20507,"The objective of this course is to explore how and why individuals and social groups rebel against authority, particularly in risky situations when rebellion is likely to incur significant personal and collective costs. This course will investigate the conditions that stoke rebellion against immoral and oppressive power structures, shared conditions, and social norms; how we know when authorities are acting immorally or unjustly; why injustice and illegitimacy only fuel rebellion in some cases and induce conformity in others; the various forms that resistance and rebellion can take; and the factors that shape rebellion's varied forms, such as exit, sabotage, protest, withholding, reclamation, violent struggle, and revolution. The empirical topics covered will address a range of rebellion under tyranny, including but not limited to rebellion during slavery in the United States, rebellion against Nazi power and the Holocaust during World War II, and resistance to colonialism and imperialism."
IIPS 20701,"This course examines the interrelationships between economic injustice and violence. It begins by investigating the gap between rich and poor both in the US and worldwide. We also look at the history of Christian thought on wealth and poverty. We then address the ways in which economic disparity intersects with the problem of violence in both domestic (violence against women) and political realms (war and revolution). Next, we canvass Christian thought on the use of violence. This raises the question of whether Christianity itself contributes more to violence or to peace. Finally, we pose the question of whether forgiveness for violence is advisable or feasible. "
IIPS 23401,"Organized violence between human communities is one of the unfortunate realities of human existence, and its causes and consequences have consequently been of great interest. Is war an inevitable outcome of human nature, or the result of specific social, historical, and environmental circumstances? Archaeology is uniquely positioned to provide concrete insights into the history of human violence through study of its direct material correlates?traumatic injuries on skeletons, fortified settlements, weaponry, and iconography. However, the archaeological record also documents the impacts of violence-reduced nutritional status and health, evidence for enslavement, cannibalism, and population decline-and can provide insights into why war occurred through examination of environment, population, and social conditions. In this course, we will explore what the archaeological record tells us about violence, human nature, and the veracity of claims for either a more violent or more peaceful past. We will examine theoretical models of war, anthropological studies of conflict, and archaeological case studies of both violent and peaceful times to understand the role that organized violence has played in human history and evolution."
IIPS 30206,"The Arab Spring represented a moment of challenge to intransigent repressive structures and aspiration to new democratic constitutional orders. To understand this moment we need to appreciate the complex history of the region. This is a survey course that approaches the intellectual history of Islam from a very specific angle: its encounter with Western political and intellectual thought. We will be looking at the first encounter with Greek political philosophy during the formative period of Arab-Islamic thought, in addition to Early and Late Modern responses to the European military and cultural challenge. The historical/comparative structure of the course makes salient the continuities and discontinuities in the thematic treatment of subjects like reform, representation, forms of government, the role of the community, and the rule of law. Some of the case studies that we will consider include Ottoman administrative and constitutional reforms, Arab nationalism, Lebanese consociationalism, and the Iranian Revolution and its constitutional project."

IIPS 30308,"This course offers an in-depth analysis of the roles of structural and cultural violence in peace studies. Unit 1 (conceptual/theoretical) explores field-formative debates over the nature, basis, and viability of structural violence and cultural violence as analytical concepts, asking how they have shaped (or failed to, but perhaps ought to shape) the field of peace studies. We will examine their critical appropriations of early critical theory, and assess comparable theoretical approaches such as reflexive sociology (Pierre Bourdieu and Loic Wacquant), post-structural analysis (Michel Foucault), and later critical theory (Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth) while asking what advantages, if any, lenses of structural and cultural violence have vis-a-vis these resources for peace analysis and peacebuilding, and where they need to be supplemented. Unit 2 (cases/agents) studies cases in which some version of these analytical lenses have been deployed for purposes of peace analysis and peacebuilding. We examine recent uses of these lenses to examine poverty, global development, and global health in building peace (e.g. Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Paul Farmer, Peter Uvin), religious/cultural identity (Veena Das), and race, class, and gender (Joshua Price on incarceration and prison abolition in the U.S; Alex Mikulich and Laurie Cassidy on white complicity in hyper incarceration)."

IIPS 30435,"What role does international law have in the advancement of human rights, and how does human rights, in turn, advance international law? This course introduces university students to the general system of modern international law (e.g. its norm-generating framework involving States and non-State actors; the roles of many State and non-State authoritative decision-makers in shaping expectations of peaceful, just, and responsible behavior in the international system; its varied constellation of dispute settlement courts and tribunals, alongside the prospects and limits of enforcing State compliance with international decisions), specifically viewed from the lens of historic global, regional, and domestic challenges to human dignity that influenced the first global codification of human rights norms under the United Nations' 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, up to the present development of the current international system of protection for human rights. The course situates the framework of modern international law and civil, political, economic, social, and cultural human rights, using five examples of the historic, defining, and 'constitutionalizing moments' for the international system: 1) the international abolition of slavery; 2) the evolution from classical to modern international law in dismantling colonial empires to enshrine the self-determination of all peoples and the equality of sovereignty of all nations; 3) the outlawing of the aggressive use of force since 1929, towards the peaceful settlement of maritime and territorial disputes and the humanitarian rules applicable to armed conflict situations; 4) the establishment of international accountability of individuals and States for genocide, crimes against humanity and other human rights atrocities; and 5) the global regulation for sustainable use, shared protection, and intergenerational responsibility over natural resources (land, oceans, atmosphere, outer space)."

American Catholics wished to see America defeat Communism but, importantly, the power of faith motivated many to criticize the state's escalation of the conflict. Students will explore the tensions and transformations of this important moment in American life. Lectures and classroom discussions will address decolonization, the global and national nature of American Catholicism, the power of the liberal state, conscientious objection, the Spirit of the Sixties, sacramental protests, the rise of human rights, geopolitics, and the Cold War.

In particular focus are nations in South Asia and the Middle East: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq. We will also look at US relations with important Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, as well as policies toward Israel-Palestine and the Bosnian War in Europe. US engagement abroad takes many forms, including public diplomacy, trade, sanctions, alliances, covert operations, financial and military aid, and direct military intervention. What are the drivers of American decision-making in the region? Why is there so much anti-American sentiment in Muslim societies? Does peace depend on a critical reassessment of US foreign policy or the reform of a radical Islamist theology? Do certain interpretations of religion make conflict inevitable, or is it possible to attain reasonable outcomes even when dealing with extremists? Through a blend of history, investigative journalism, case studies, opinion polls, literature, and film, this course broadens our perspectives on some of America's longest wars in the Muslim world."
IIPS 30521,"This course is an introduction to the history of the peoples of Africa from the late nineteenth century to the present day. During the term, we will consider the ways in which Africans shaped and were shaped by the transformative events of the period. In the second half of the nineteenth century, European powers conquered and colonized much of the continent. Over the next sixty years, Africans lived and died under the yoke of European rule; some resisted, others collaborated, but all influenced the nature of colonialism and its eventual collapse. By the 1960s, most Africans were free of foreign rule. Since then the peoples of Africa have endeavored to achieve political stability, navigate Cold War politics, harness development aid, and adapt to a globalizing economy. In recent years, they have succumbed to brutal wars and endured devastating famines, but they have also inspired the world with their triumph over apartheid, emerging vibrant democracies, rich cultures, and deep history. In this class, we will identify, problematize, and debate these major themes in Modern African history. We also will make use of a variety of texts, from historical documents to classic academic works to works of African art, film, and fiction."

Generations of activists, scholars, and everyday people have fought and persevered to bring about social, cultural, and policy change.     This course engages deeply with topics relevant to the national discourse on racial and ethnic relations in the U.S. The first part of the course examines key concepts, focusing on the social construction of race and ethnicity, prejudice, and discrimination. The second part reviews the historical experiences of Native Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans. The third and final part of the course centers on four critical issues that are especially relevant in 2020: (1) immigration; (2) political disenfranchisement; (3) racial and ethnic disparities in health; and (4) racism in the criminal justice system."
IIPS 30945,"This course will explore modern conspiracy theories in and about the United States, discovering what they tell us about American culture and about how the rest of the world perceives the United States. The truth we will be seeking will not necessarily be whether secret forces have ever conspired or currently conspire to influence specific world events, but what conspiracy theorizing can tell us about modern American identities, communities, and social hierarchies including race, gender, class, religion, and national origin. In other words, we will take theories of conspiracy seriously as vernacular narratives that contribute to collective and individual identity formation, produce powerful symbolic systems for ordering and inverting hierarchies, and help communities negotiate religious, political, and ethnic differences. Beginning with the Cold War and moving on to the War on Terror, we will discuss why some theories gain preeminence in certain historical contexts and among different social groups. The course will have a transnational bend, studying how theories of conspiracy travel across national boundaries. In addition, we will interrogate the role the label conspiracy theory plays within contemporary dynamics of knowledge/power. What types of knowledge are respected and acceptable and what types are stigmatized and mocked, and why? Assignments include in-class presentations, a take-home midterm, and a research-based final paper."
IIPS 33101,"This junior seminar is a required course for the supplementary major and minor in peace studies.  The course focuses on strategic peacebuilding, an analytical framework for investigating the causes and dynamics of conflict, conflict resolution and transformation, and post-conflict reconstruction and justice.  This seminar seeks to: (1) deepen student knowledge of foundational concepts and questions in peace studies; (2) introduce students to a variety of methodological approaches common in peace studies research; and (3) explore the relation between ethical, empirical and practical approaches in the field.  The course provides students with the tools necessary to carry out their later research in the peace studies senior seminar and encourages a deeper understanding of how their own research interests connect to peace studies.  This course is open to peace studies majors and minors only."
IIPS 33204,"In June 2020, prompted by the horrific killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, our nation awakened to the brutality of institutional racism and the violence to human dignity it has wrought in communities of color throughout America's history. The movement for racial justice was renewed in vigor with nationwide protests and calls for action. Although the protests of 2020 have largely been a response to a crisis surrounding police violence, the calls to action have focused attention on the breadth of systemic racism in all facets of American life. In this course, students will engage weekly with a single event or concept, drawn from a variety of disciplines, necessary to understand and dismantle systemic racism. The course centers around a weekly guest-lecture series featuring authors, public intellectuals, faith leaders, and external and internal members of the academy. In each guest-lecture class period, the guest expert provides a sophisticated introduction to a discrete racial justice topic. Some lectures address historical events not widely known (e.g., the Tulsa massacre or the arrival of the first slave ship in the Americas in 1619); others address current racial inequities (e.g., the wealth gap, health outcomes, criminal justice, voter suppression); still others examine broad concepts (e.g., intersectionality, Catholic teaching on racism). Specific topics to be determined by expert availability. This three-credit version of the course is designed for students who are interested in a more intensive study of each week's topic. Students will participate in once-weekly in-person seminar sessions with readings to accompany the speaker and topic for the week. Following each guest lecture, students will gather briefly via zoom to reflect and respond. Throughout the course of the semester, students will compose a variety of short papers, lead classroom discussions, and complete a final project incorporating independent research on related topics."

IIPS 40101,"Could business be an instrument of peace or is it more likely to be an agent of division that foments conflict? While the course will touch on questions of whether trade and economic development as well as different economic systems impact causes of violence, the class focuses specifically on the role of for-profit and non-profit institutions within the context of current economic systems. This course draws upon three perspectives to undertake a 360-degree assessment of this question about business's role. First, it will examine the ways in which the actions of business exploit populations, profit from war-making, and sometimes actively engage in the promotion of violence. Second, it looks at an area of academic inquiry sometimes called Business For Peace, in which the ways in which businesses can be instruments of peace have been explored. The ways businesses might do this include being more actively involved in peacemaking and peacekeeping in zones of conflict as well as more general, incremental forms of peacebuilding that could occur both in and outside of zones of conflict. Third, the course looks at newer, nuanced theories from political theorists that assess the positives and negatives of the role of business in engagement in peace."
IIPS 40413,"This course will involve students, in a structured format, in assessing, prioritizing and creatively solving problems encountered by low-income and other disadvantaged South Bend entrepreneurs. We will employ a process-consulting approach and introduce a number of other useful tools and frameworks. Students will work with both for-profit and non-profit enterprises, producing tangible deliverables that help clients launch, grow and sustain their ventures. In addition to class time, students will meet with clients on a weekly basis at a Notre Dame facility located downtown, with transportation assistance available for those needing it. The class will meet for a normal session on Tuesdays. On Thursdays, students will consult with local entrepreneurs in one hour blocks during the evening hours at the Center for Civic Innovation. This consulting time is flexible with students' schedules and based on appointments made by local entrepreneurs."
IIPS 40416,"What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films. Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba)."
IIPS 40609,"Understanding religious communities and their values are crucial to understanding human societies and global affairs. One particular group of interpreters of Islam, namely the traditional or orthodox religious scholars called the ulama and their institutions, are often hidden from contemporary accounts of Islam when in fact they are critical players. This course will provide historical contexts in order to explore how traditional Muslims navigate the discourses of modernity and how they resist it. We will read original texts in translation and secondary sources of descriptions of representatives of the orthodox tradition in regions of Asia, the Middle East and in the West. The course will pay particular attention to the institutions of learning known as madrasas, jami` and hawzas. Of course, the orthodox views are challenged by other Muslims and some of those debates will also be channeled in the class while the focus will remain on the Ulama. The course aims to equip students with analytical skills and the resources to understand how religious ideas impact religious communities and global affairs."

IIPS 43101,The peace studies senior seminar is a capstone course for both the supplemental major and the minor in peace studies. The centerpiece of the course is a seminar paper that students research and write on a subject of their choice in light of the theme of the course.  The course also consists of readings and discussions that explore familiar topics in peace studies in greater depth as well as introduce research methods to the students. This required course is open to peace studies majors and minors only.
IIPS 43501,"One would think that secrets are hard to keep, and lies hard to maintain, because it doesn't take much for the truth to escape and once it's out, it can't be put back into the bottle. Yet secrets and lies reside at the heart of much social and political order, sometimes for years and even decades at a time. The objective of this course is to advance our scientific understanding of how this is possible, drawing on sociological, psychological, and historical research on such things as performance, secrecy, lying, forgetting, doubt, denial, and inattention. Case studies will include instances of corporate malfeasance (such as Ponzi schemes and insider trading), Big Tobacco's cover-up of the health consequences of smoking, the lies told by the totalitarian regime of North Korea, the secret British program to break the German cipher during WWII, elaborate attempts to cover up government atrocities, and the cat-and-mouse game between international inspectors and regimes thought to be developing banned weapons. Throughout, we will be concerned with the distinct methodological challenges of studying things many people want to keep secret. Requirements will include midterm and final examinations, reading quizzes/reaction papers, participation, and a final research paper."

IIPS 50405,"Why is talking about climate change without reference to colonial pasts an incomplete conversation? Why is a forward-looking climate justice conversation incomplete unless it is also looking back? How does coloniality present today? How does the global south figure in writing on climate change? Can there be a role for the global south in the climate justice conversation that recognizes its vulnerability to climate change but goes beyond portraying it as always and only vulnerable, devastated and/or menacing? In this class we will begin with the premise that the answer is yes: not only is such a role possible, but it must actively be created if the climate justice conversation is to an inclusive one. Examining representations of climate refugees, extreme weather events, and imagined geographies of conflicts, and informed by scholarship on racialized constructions of ‘good' and ‘bad' migrants, in this class we will collectively work through the intersections between the political and ecological that today determine the movement of humans, capital, and knowledge. Our collective endeavor will be to: (i) understand writing on climate change with a focus on its implicit (yet predominant) threat and risk imaginaries; (ii) question the role of the global south in such writing; and (iii) craft a lexicon that is cognizant of colonial pasts and their continuity, and relates geographies, histories and politics in more equal ways."
IIPS 50406,"Human beings experience peace and conflicts comprehensively, they touch human life in all aspects of existence. While dominant models of inquiry have privileged the use of disembodied reason, this course will consider what new avenues emerge when the role of the body in the production of knowledge is centered. Based on John Paul Lederach's Moral Imagination and expanding on the Kroc Institute's approach towards reflective peace building, this course will introduce students to humanistic and decolonial methods to peace building research and practice. Through somatic practice students will actively engage embodied knowing. Following the model of the scholar-practitioner students will study the conceptual foundations and applications of comprehensive embodied practices for peacebuilding. They will engage with the ontological, epistemological and ethical foundations of embodied research and their integration into research designs via qualitative methods. Emphasis will be placed on auto-ethnographic, decolonial, reflective and performative methodologies. Through the practice of dance (conscious dance), theatre (Theatre for Living/Theatre of the Oppressed) and breath (transpersonal approaches) students will come to understand how topics of peace and conflict are held, expressed and transformed through the body.

IIPS 60100,"This course is designed for students in master's degree programs who are pursuing the graduate minor in peace studies. It provides a cross-disciplinary examination of violence and peace issues so that students will have a firm grounding in the more serious concepts, methods, frameworks and findings which peace research scholars, policy makers, and activists employ in dealing with war and violence. The course also provides opportunities to read and write about various issues areas that are distinctive in their own right, but which also have particular relevance to the task of strategic peacebuilding. Operationally, the first half of the course will examine the various schools of thought, the controversies, and the key concepts, theories and methods which have guided the development of the interdisciplinary field of peace studies, thus our label of foundations for the course. The second half of the course examines critical issues that are significantly tied both to peace research and to peacebuilding practice."
IIPS 60227,"What is psychic life? The word psyche has encompassed a range of definitions as it has travelled through time, from notions of mind, soul, spirit, and the conscious and unconscious mind, to a mirror, an asteroid discovered in 1852, a moth or butterfly, and anima mundi, the animating principle of the universe itself. Today an additional constellation of concepts may also be drawn into psyche's orbit, including brain, emotion, feeling, affect, self, subjectivity, person, ego, and experience. As opposed to terms like mental health, the concept of psychic life provides a language with which to speak about a range of phenomena across multiple traditions, epistemologies, and histories, without prioritizing any one conceptualization over another or locating the psyche within the boundaries of an individual mind, as distinct from the body and the world. Instead, in this course we will explore psychic life through the various ways in which it is known-as lived-experience; cultural, historical, and political form; object of intervention; and site of experimentation. The approaches engaged in this course draw from psychological anthropology, ethnopsychology, critical global health, history of medicine, cultural studies, affect theory, psychoanalysis, and critical phenomenology with an overarching dedication to de-stigmatizing mental illness, and embracing neurodiversity in all its forms. Along the way we will cover topics including madness and reason, psychopolitics, global mental health, the governance of the self, the psychic life of racism, radical mental health collectives and the psychedelic renaissance, as well as a set of phenomena that lie at the limits of experience, such as psychosomatization, solitary confinement, oceanic feeling, and dreaming."

Students will be asked to develop their own perspectives on promising new directions in the field for the future."
IIPS 80202,"The course explores the Christian contribution (or difference) to efforts towards peace in the world. The course has two parts. Part one is a theoretical exploration of the history and assumptions that sustain the discussion of theology and peacebuilding. Behind this formulation is the assumption that theology and peace-building constitute two independent disciplines each with its own field of investigation, unique methodologies and criteria for rational inquiry. However, once the discussion is set up within these parameters, theology cannot but be reduced to simply providing a useful contribution- an add on to an independently derived and more primary realm of peace. The critical thrust of this first section will be to show that the political and ideological assumptions of peacebuilding (and thus peace studies generally understood) do not often allow for a full appreciation of theology as a way of life, grounded in and shaped by a matrix of practices and disciplines, whose overall effect is meant to shape the Christian into a vision and patterns of peace in the world.   The constructive direction of the section will be to point to a more complex, multi-layered and at times contested relationship between theology and peacebuilding. In the second part, using representative stories of individuals and communities, the course will explore the theological matrix that informs and sustains the Christian practice of peace. Among others, the scriptural imagination, lament, hope, and conversion will be identified as key disciplines within this matrix. But because these disciplines are produced and reproduced in the habitual practices of the church, it makes Christian peacebuilding a form of improvisation which takes place within particular, local and specific contexts. The stories display not only the inner logic of a Christian theology of peace, but the multiple possibilities of Christian peacebuilding efforts in the world."

IIPS 83100,"Peace Studies is not the same discipline it was when it was founded in the mid-20th century, when scholars and activists alike were preoccupied with the Cold War, nuclear arms proliferation, forced conscription, and the lingering questions of the Holocaust and World War II. Though we have not left those challenges behind, the world is now also confronted with climate change, racial injustice, inequality-driven pandemics, and global social movements that are emerging to contend with these threats. Emerging Issues in Peace Studies examines some of these challenges through the normative commitments and orientations within peace studies, using detailed case studies of recent and ongoing threats to peace organized thematically, and how we are addressing the more hidden, systemic, and pernicious causes of human suffering. This course responds dynamically to the threats to humanity as they are emergent, and will be taught by faculty intimately involved in these issues in their own research and writing."

IIPS 83220,"Organized violence between human communities is one of the unfortunate realities of human existence, and its causes and consequences have consequently been of great interest. Is war an inevitable outcome of human nature, or the result of specific social, historical, and environmental circumstances? Archaeology is uniquely positioned to provide concrete insights into the history of human violence through study of its direct material correlates?traumatic injuries on skeletons, fortified settlements, weaponry, and iconography. However, the archaeological record also documents the impacts of violence?reduced nutritional status and health, evidence for enslavement, cannibalism, and population decline?and can provide insights into why war occurred through examination of environment, population, and social conditions. In this course, we will explore what the archaeological record tells us about violence, human nature, and the veracity of claims for either a more violent or more peaceful past. We will examine theoretical models of war, anthropological studies of conflict, and archaeological case studies of both violent and peaceful times to understand the role that organized violence has played in human history and evolution."

ILS 20102,"Together with the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean have been among the most influential exporters of music globally since the early 20th century. This course traces these processes of musical production and consumption. Students will be introduced to important historical and stylistic musical developments as we survey various styles and genres with attention to their cultural significance - including the corrido (Mexican ballad), Caribbean-derived salsa, and cumbia, among others. Our approach, such that we are dealing with music-cultures, is at once anthropological and ethnomusicological. In order we achieve our aims, the course is organized along two axes: one chronological (so to speak), the other conceptual, neither complete. The chronological portion will allow us to survey various genres and ensembles of musical production. We dovetail this effort with a focus on important themes and concepts that aid in understanding the present and historical conditions of the terrain where performance, identity, race-ethnicity, gender, transnationalism, and commoditized publics intersect."

Emphasis will be placed on film's reflecting African Diaspora, Latinx and Caribbean cultures and the inclusion of religions outside of the Judeo-Christian canon for context and comparison. In discussing films from across a range of subjects and genres, we will engage in the work of mythical, theological and ideological criticism, while examining the nature, function, and value of religion and religious experience. We will also consider significant writers and traditions in the field of Diaspora Religions and develop the analytical and interpretive skills of the discipline. Given the depth and breadth of religious orthodoxies and faith-based practices existent throughout the Diaspora, students will be exposed to a variety of film genres including silent films, anime, documentary, drama, biography, comedy and horror.

We will also be relying significantly on a series of online resources, including video interviews with Latinx poets conducted here at Notre Dame. We will focus mainly on mid-career writers, discovering and examining some of the themes that characterize Latinx poetry. A number of the poets who we'll be reading will be special guests, via ZOOM, at various points during the semester: we'll get to ask them questions, and watch and hear them read some poems. We'll also encounter poems that challenge what one might expect when one hears the term, Latinx poetry.   "

This course investigates the ideological tensions that inform the gaze and how this gravitational force is experienced, produced, enforced, and reimagined by marginalized beings. It also reevaluates the gaze itself; we will examine the gaze within cinema, as a form of self-expression, institutional power, and a critical lens through which to question our looking practices. We will investigate how nationalism, race, gender, sexuality, ability, and class produce gazes while examining alternative gazes that envision an elsewhere. Context will guide our discussion as we consider how gazes are enforced within family, work, and political structures. Throughout the semester, students will research various interdisciplinary approaches to the gaze, consider their personal looking practices, and create a gaze of their own. This course takes an intersectional approach to the gaze; possible texts include La Llorona, Lilo and Stitch, and poetry by Alan Pelaez Lopez and Larry Mitchell."

By focusing on various Latina/o groups and the intersectionality of race, ethnicity, gender, class, and citizenship, this course will highlight the diversity within the category Latina/o. This course has an optional community-engaged learning component with La Casa de Amistad."
ILS 20704,"Many have claimed that the American educational system is the great equalizer among men. In other words, the educational system gives everyone a chance to prosper in American society regardless of their social origins. In this course, we will explore the validity of this claim. Do schools help make American society more equal by reducing the importance of class, race, and gender as sources of inequality, or do schools simply reinforce existing inequalities and reproduce pre-existing social relations? Topics covered in the course include: unequal resources among schools, sorting practices of students within schools, parents' role in determining student outcomes, the role of schooling in determining labor market outcomes for individuals, and the use of educational programs as a remedy for poverty."
ILS 20801,"This course contributes to Notre Dame's core curriculum through its examination of theology as reflection on faith within the context of a living Christian Tradition. The course explores how theology - classically understood as faith seeking understanding - addresses questions Latinx Christians probe as they seek to live Christian faith in engagement with the world. More specifically, the course investigates three core topics: (a) the history of Latinx Christians as the context for their theological reflection; (b) an assessment of the theological significance of Jesus's Galilean origins; and (c) Latinx devotion and religious traditions as expressions of their lived faith and as resources for theology."
ILS 20913,"Students will be introduced to Literatura Infantil y Juvenil (LIJ) in the Spanish-speaking world through a combination of considerable reading of LIJ across genres and levels and a critical perspective of LIJ via academic text and articles. Books read will include many award winners by prolific writers and illustrators of LIJ, as well as widely known writers for adults who have also written children's books. Among genres read will be folklore, narrative, fiction (representing afro-latino, indigenous and other multi-cultural groups; contemporary, realistic, historical), short story, and poetry. In addition, students will develop criteria for evaluating quality LIJ through a variety of interdisciplinary perspectives. Finally, there is a Community-Based Learning (CBL) component where students will share LIJ with the local Latino community through CBL projects and a reading program with Latino youth. Pre-requiste: ROSP 20202 or above or placement by exam. This course can count as an advanced elective towards the major. Taught in Spanish. Students must have a Language Exam Score between 440 and 600 to enroll in this class."
ILS 22301,"Students wishing to enroll in this section MUST be enrolled concurrently in ROSP 30201/ILS 20710: Introduction to Latino Studies. Students who have completed the Notre Dame language requirement in Spanish are eligible to sign up for an additional single credit discussion section as part of the Languages Across the Curriculum (LxC) initiative of the College of Arts and Letters. Choosing this option means that students will do some additional reading in Spanish language materials (approximately 20-25 pages a week), and meet once a week with a graduate student or faculty tutor from the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures who will guide a discussion in Spanish and grade some brief writing assignments. The LxC discussion section in Spanish associated with this course will be graded on a pass/fail basis and will be credited on the student's transcript. Up to three LxC discussion sections can be applied toward a major, secondary major or minor in Spanish. Please talk to the instructor if you are interested in adding this supplemental credit."
ILS 30002,"In 2023, it is difficult to avoid the language of antiracism, and harder still to discern its politics. Is racism a matter of structure or intention? Culture or economics? What does racial justice look like? And what exactly are those structures anyways? Moving from the civil rights movement of the 1960s to the George Floyd Uprisings of 2020, this course introduces students to the history behind a freighted term. We will read classic and contemporary texts of antiracism, tracking how American activists, politicians, artists, and scholars wrestled with these questions in the twilight years of the welfare state, mass industry, and securely waged employment.  "
ILS 30005,"This course will survey representations of Latinos in American cinema from the silent era to the present.  We will examine how stereotypes associated with Latinos have been produced, reinforced, and challenged in American films - from greasers and Latin lovers to gangsters, kingpins, and border crossers.  We will explore the fascinating contradiction that, despite a long history of misrepresentation and underrepresentation, Latinos have made significant contributions to Hollywood and independent cinema.  We will also examine the rise of Latino directors in recent years and their drive to reframe the Latino image for American audiences.  Screenings will range from the silent epic Martyrs of the Alamo (1915) to more recent films such as Maria Full of Grace (2004).  Our interdisciplinary approach to the subject will draw upon readings from history, film theory and criticism, and ethnic/American studies.  Students will take a midterm exam and make class presentations."
ILS 30007,"This CAD course looks back to 1850, when urban industrial America began, and looks forward to 2050, when Notre Dame promises to be carbon neutral, to critically engage competing visions of individual, communal, and ecological flourishing.  It focuses on economic, racial, and environmental justice as students explore how US political culture, the discipline of American Studies, and Catholic social teaching have clashed and converged and Americans proposed varying solutions to poverty, racism, and environmental degradation.  After an introduction to American Studies, we turn to visions of the good life in foundational US political documents (the Declaration, the Constitution, and Inaugural Addresses) and in Catholic tradition (scriptural passages, theological essays, and papal encyclicals, from Rerum Novarum to Laudato Si'). Then the course's three main sections consider, in turn, economic equity, racial justice, and environmental restoration. Each section includes a faith in action case study and concludes with an integrative essay that puts Catholic social teaching into conversation with American Studies scholarship. In the final class session, Learning Groups present their synthesis of the course material, and, during the exam period, each student submits a final integrative essay that focuses on one of the issues—poverty, racism, or environmental degradation—and identifies what American Studies might learn from the Catholic Tradition and what the Catholic Tradition might learn from American Studies. "
ILS 30042,"Drawing on Lave and Wenger's (1991) theory of legitimate peripheral participation, this Community Based Learning course is structured to allow students to participate in two communities: (1) an elementary classroom during English Language Arts instruction time to both observe the teacher's pedagogy and work directly with children and (2) as a developing literacy researcher with students in the course. Students will learn about research based best practices in literacy instruction during seminars and apply these strategies and approaches in the classroom while working with small groups and individual children. Students will also learn about and apply qualitative approaches to data collection and analysis to study 2-3 children's growth over the semester and to make meaningful and insightful connections between theory and practice. Since the majority of students' time will be dedicated to read-alouds and teaching multicultural children's literature, students will develop an extensive annotated bibliography of children's literature to deepen understanding and appreciation for literature for children. On-Site: Students should plan to spend 3 hours per week at Muessel Elementary School (based on when ELA is taught, typically in the morning, and ND students' schedule). Beginning Week 3, we will only meet on Tuesdays for seminar on campus. Students are responsible for their own transportation."
ILS 30145,"This course offers a critical examination of what it means to be an immigrant or child of immigrants through scholarly works, memoirs, blogs, and popular journalism. Since the liberalization of immigration policy in 1965, immigrants from Latin America and Asia are becoming an increasing and emergent demographic of American society. In major American cities such as Los Angeles and New York, they comprise over 50% of the population. This course focuses on how immigrants and the children of immigrants experience the United States. How are immigrants changing the US racial and ethnic structure? How do their experiences differ given varying legal statuses? How is the second generation becoming American? We will explore these questions through readings that focus on family, religion, education, dating and sexuality. This course will include a community based learning component where students will work with immigrant serving organizations. Students will have the option to teach citizenship classes or to work with immigrant children. Service will be 2-3 hours per week outside of class."
ILS 30401,"This course is designed to introduce students to Mexico's modern history and its people. We will pay particular attention to political and artistic movements during the Porfiriato (1876-1910), the Revolution (1910-1938), and the post-revolutionary period (1938-1970s). We will include a detailed discussion of the recent disappearance of 43 students in Ayotzinapa, in the State of Guerrero. Students will examine what it meant to be a militant in the political world of artistic production and social movements and the different ways in which the Mexican state responded to this militancy. We will explore how and why a broad range of representative leaders of Mexico's most important political and cultural revolutions used paintings, murals, graphic art, cartoons, literature, music, film, and graffiti to (A) lead a social, cultural, and political restructuring of their respective communities; (B) export their unique notions of Revolution to the nation and the world; and (C) question the contradictions that some artists (at times) faced within their own revolutionary movements. "
ILS 30406,"When Columbus stepped ashore in the Caribbean in 1492, he set in motion a process that led to the creation of wealthy Spanish and Portuguese empires in the Americas, the genocide of countless numbers of indigenous men and women, the enslavement of millions of African men and women, and the eventual formation of a variety of independent states competing in the world economy. In this semester-long survey, we will examine topics in this history that will allow us to consider how history is produced as well as what happened in the past, from various perspectives, from elite colonial administrators and merchants to indigenous peasants and formerly enslaved men and women. "
ILS 30407,"This is an interdisciplinary history course examining the Latino experience in the United States after 1848. We will examine the major demographic, social, economic and political trends of the past 150 years with an eye to understanding Latino/a America. Necessarily a large portion of the subject matter will focus on the history of Mexican-Americans, and Mexican immigrants in the Southwest and Midwestern United States, but we will also explore the histories of Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Latin-Americans within the larger Latino/a community. Latinos are US citizens and as such the course will spend significant time on the status of these groups before the law, and their relations with the state, at the federal, local, and community level. To explore these issues within the various Latino communities of the US we will explore the following key topics covered: historical roots of Latinos/as in the US; the evolution of a Latino/a ethnicity and identity within the US; immigration, transmigration, and the shaping of Latino/a communities; Latino/a labor history; segregation; civil rights; nationalism and transnationalism; the Chicano Civil Rights Movement; Latinos in film; and post-1965 changes in Latino/a life."
ILS 30410,"The aim of this class is to try to understand what conquest, as we have traditionally called it, meant to the people who experienced it in some parts of the Americas that joined the Spanish monarchy in the sixteenth century. We'll concentrate on indigenous sources - documentary, pictorial, and material - and try to adopt the indigenous point of view, without neglecting sources mediated by Europeans. Although the class will concentrate on selected cases from Mesoamerica, the lecturer will try to set the materials in the context of other encounters, both within the Americas and further afield; and students will be free, if they wish, to explore case-studies from anywhere they choose in the Americas (in consultation with the lecturer and subject to his approval) in their individual projects."
ILS 30414,"This course will examine the long history of struggle for civil rights by the Latina and Latino communities. Representing an estimated 65.3 million residents of the United States, the demographic is the largest minority group. However, their experiences represent a clear paradox. Despite their “American” identity, they remain “Others” to many in the United States. Beginning with the forceful incorporation of ethnic Mexicans in the mid-nineteenth century, this course covers the triumphs and failures of collective action by this community for a variety of rights and access on their path to inclusion. These include workplace strikes for equal pay, unionization drives, walkouts against educational discrimination, interfaith alliances for immigration rights, and more. Through covering various topics, this course documents the strategies Latinas and Latinos utilized in their social movements and negotiates the consequences of those tactics and their lasting influence in their communities. In these struggles for equality, Latinas and Latinos advocated for educational reform, reshaped public space, and influenced the negotiations of their place in society."
ILS 30415,"The purpose of this course is to introduce students to major themes in the global history of slavery with a specific focus on the location of slavery in the making of the modern world bringing together histories from the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean worlds. The course will focus upon these themes through literature, economics, and politics. In addition, the course will also introduce students to recent museum exhibitions, art exhibitions, digital history projects, films, and documentary compilations that all together have transformed how the global history of slavery is understood. "
ILS 30442,"This course explores the relationships among and between workers, employers, government policymakers, unions, and social movements since the end of World War II, as well as the ways in which those relationships have shaped and been shaped by American politics and culture more broadly. The United States emerged from the Second World War as the globe's unequaled economic and political power, and its citizens parlayed that preeminence into a long postwar economic boom that created, however imperfectly, the first truly mass middle-class society in world history. At the heart of that new society was the American labor movement, whose leaders and members ensured that at least some of the heady postwar profits made it into the wallets of workers and their families - and not just the wallets of union members, as working Americans generally experienced great improvement in wages, benefits, and economic opportunity during the quarter-century ending in 1970. During those same years, civil rights activists challenged the historic workplace discrimination that kept African Americans at the bottom of the labor market, confronting the racism of employers, unions, and the government, and inspiring others, primarily Mexican Americans and women, to broaden the push for equality at the workplace. Since that time, however, Americans have experienced a transformation in the workplace -- an erosion of manufacturing and the massive growth of service and government work; a rapid decline in number of union members and power of organized labor; and unresolved conflicts over affirmative action to redress centuries of racial and gender discrimination. Meanwhile, income inequality and wealth disparities have grown every year over the past three decades. What accounts for the decline of organized labor since 1970, and why have the people of the mythic land of milk and honey experienced declining upward mobility and widening gaps between the rich and everyone else? Are these phenomena linked? What has the decline of the labor movement meant for workers specifically, and the American economy and politics more broadly? How and why have popular perceptions of unions changed over time? What has been the relationship of organized labor to the civil rights movement, feminism, modern conservatism, and the fortunes of individual freedom more broadly? What is globalization, and what has been its impact upon American workers? Through an exploration of historical scholarship, memoirs, polemical writings, and films, this course will try to answer these questions and many others. It will also address the prospects for working people and labor unions in the twenty-first century."
ILS 30508,"This course introduces students to major actors, institutions, processes, and policies of sub-state governments in the United States.  Through an intensive comparative examination of historical and contemporary politics in city governments, we will gain an understanding of municipal government and its role within the larger contexts of state and national government."
ILS 30509,"Immigration is an issue of increasing importance in the United States. Few issues have generated as much debate and emotion as the immigration policy. The goal of this course is to provide students with an overview of the critical normative and academic questions in political science regarding immigration in the U.S. What factors have affected contemporary and historical immigration policy in the United States? In particular how have economics, demographics, politics, religion, culture, environmental concerns, and ethnic and nationalist interests impacted the nature of immigration politics and policy? How have groups leveraged political influence for desired immigration policy outcomes? We will study the impact of worldwide immigration and population trends on the formulation of American policy. The emphasis will be on an academic understanding of how immigration policy has been affected by domestic and international demographic and political factors"
ILS 30701,"We are living through a watershed moment in United States history. Structural racism is at the forefront of the national discourse. Yet, the threat that racism holds on our nation's most cherished ideals of democracy and justice is hardly new. Generations of activists, scholars, and everyday people have fought and persevered to bring about social, cultural, and policy change.     This course engages deeply with topics relevant to the national discourse on racial and ethnic relations in the U.S. The first part of the course examines key concepts, focusing on the social construction of race and ethnicity, prejudice, and discrimination. The second part reviews the historical experiences of Native Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans. The third and final part of the course centers on four critical issues that are especially relevant in 2020: (1) immigration; (2) political disenfranchisement; (3) racial and ethnic disparities in health; and (4) racism in the criminal justice system."
ILS 30902,"This is an upper-division course for students with advanced preparation. It serves as the introduction to the analysis and explication of Spanish-language literary texts. Short texts in prose, poetry, and theatre from a variety of periods and countries within the Hispanic world are read, presented, and discussed. The course is a prerequisite for the survey courses, and must be completed by the end of the junior year."
ILS 30904,"This is an advanced-intermediate fifth-semester culture-based Spanish course designed for students who want to improve their communication skills in Spanish and broaden their understanding of the Hispanic world. Students will work with selected Latino families to preserve and document their histories, creating a lasting record that they can proudly pass down to future generations. By being involved in this important project, students will not only enhance their language skills, but also their cultural awareness, of and sensitivity to, this growing demographic group, as well as further develop their civic engagement. Through literature, film, current events, and guest speakers, students will develop knowledge about migration issues, family immigration histories, and problems facing our Latino communities in general, and particularly in South Bend. Students through ethical engagements will work on a collaborative creation and preservation of memory (memory of an experience that shapes everyday life and the future). Using storytelling techniques, students will work with families to create a collaborative book detailing their life and path to our community. The dispositions that the students will further develop through this class are a better understanding of the Latino culture and appreciation for our customs, an awareness of the diversity of Latino culture, an intercultural competence as well as a reflective sensibility."

ILS 40507,"Was the American Constitution originally a pro-slavery constitution that changed over time to a constitution that outlawed slavery and state-supported racial discrimination? Did the Civil War and subsequent developments through the civil rights acts of the 1960's represent a commitment implicit in constitutional principles from the nation's beginning? Do these constitutional principles embrace active governmental efforts to achieve an equal-opportunity society, including equal educational opportunity and an end to racism, a private attitude? Do constitutional principles promise a color-blind society? Or do they promise no more than color-blind governments? This course addresses these questions. Readings will include state documents like the Declaration of Independence and The Federalist Papers, the speeches of American politicians and other public figures, and decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court regarding slavery, public accommodations, education, voting, housing, and employment."
ILS 40508,"Why is talking about climate change without reference to colonial pasts an incomplete conversation? Why is a forward-looking climate justice conversation incomplete unless it is also looking back? How does coloniality present today? How does the global south figure in writing on climate change? Can there be a role for the global south in the climate justice conversation that recognizes its vulnerability to climate change but goes beyond portraying it as always and only vulnerable, devastated and/or menacing? In this class we will begin with the premise that the answer is yes: not only is such a role possible, but it must actively be created if the climate justice conversation is to an inclusive one. Examining representations of climate refugees, extreme weather events, and imagined geographies of conflicts, and informed by scholarship on racialized constructions of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ migrants, in this class we will collectively work through the intersections between the political and ecological that today determine the movement of humans, capital, and knowledge. Our collective endeavor will be to: (i) understand writing on climate change with a focus on its implicit (yet predominant) threat and risk imaginaries; (ii) question the role of the global south in such writing; and (iii) craft a lexicon that is cognizant of colonial pasts and their continuity, and relates geographies, histories and politics in more equal ways."

ILS 41103,"This one credit course immerses students in service in the Latino community of South Bend as tutors, assistants, mentors, translators, etc. Students must be enrolled in the classroom course of Mexican Immigration to take this class."
ILS 43010,"This seminar examines the relationship between art and social movements in Latinx communities from the civil rights era to the present. The course will focus on graphic art media that negotiates relations of power, constructs multiple publics, and fuels many of the debates around the politics of identity. We will consider notions of authorship (collective/individual), activism, display, dissemination, consumption, collecting, and technology. Students will learn to think critically and empathetically about how these collective modes of art-making foreground the politics of representation: what we see, how we see, who gets to control our image, and how can printed multiples challenge those narratives. Students will enhance their skills in visual analysis and writing, gain experience in collaborative printmaking, and refine their ability to conduct original research."
ILS 43102,"This course will examine the health of Latinos in South Bend from an interdisciplinary perspective drawing on biology, medicine and cultural anthropology.  We will consider both the scientific bases of specific diseases affecting Latinos and the social, cultural, economic and environmental factors that increase risk and limit access to therapy. We will discuss topics such as antimicrobial resistance, chronic illnesses, labor-related afflictions, mental health and the effects of climate change on Latino well-being. We take seriously subjects' holistic, embodied understandings of suffering and their pragmatic quest for treatment across a pluralistic continuum from curanderismo to biomedicine. A critical analysis of health injustice and ways to cure this systemic dis-ease guide our class research, seminar discussions and scholarly goals.       "
ILS 43401,"This course examines the Global Sixties (c.1956-c.1976) with particular attention to politics, culture and religion in the United States, Western Europe, and Latin America. The emphasis will be placed primarily on the topics of youth activism and state repression from the perspective (and influence) of the Global South. The main goal of the course is to provide an opportunity for extensive reading in the Global Sixties historiography. For this, it pays particular attention to influential primary texts, ideas, interpretations, ideological currents, and repercussions of the period with emphasis on the broader context of the Cold War. Additional and more specific goals include: (1) exploring the different approaches and methods that historians have used to interpret the history of the Global Sixties; and (2) providing methodological background and advice that will aid students to write original research papers.  "
ILS 43504,"In the United States, public policy has the potential to be a consequential mechanism to address the most vexing and important social and economic problems: inequality, poverty, mass incarceration, climate change and much more. But policies do not appear out of thin air. They are the product of complex political processes. Even after policies are made, political decisions determine how they are implemented and to what end. In order to evaluate or change policy, we must understand politics. That is the focus of this course. We begin with a review of theoretical approaches to conceptualizing and studying public policy. We then explore key policy actors (the President, interest groups, denizens etc.), as well as core aspects of policy design and implementation. Finally, we closely study contemporary policy arenas. Along the way, students will be challenged to grapple with the paradoxes of policy making and to envision pathways to substantive change. Father Hesburgh famously credited President Lyndon Johnson's commitment to civil rights with changing the face of America. This class recognizes that dramatic policy change must consider the politics behind that change and politics seeking to maintain the status quo. This course fulfills the capstone requirement for the Hesburgh Program in Public Service and Latino Studies. "
ILS 43712,"America is the richest country in the world and yet about three million American children now grow up in families surviving on just $2 a day. As America's richest 0.1% have seen their incomes more than quadruple over the last forty years, the incomes for 90% of Americans have barely changed. These financial disparities reflect deeper inequities: inequalities in health, educational opportunity, social status and more.  In this course, we will examine the nature and consequences of American inequality. After a broad overview of historical and comparative trends, the course will address such questions as: What kinds of inequalities, if any, should trouble us, and why? How do aspects of individuals' identities - such as race, gender, and social class - shape their life chances? How is inequality (re)produced by institutions like schools, neighborhoods, and the criminal justice system? And, finally, what might be done to make America less unequal in the years to come?"

IRLL 20115,"Ireland produced one of the most unique, extensive, and oldest literatures in Europe. In this class we look at a wide range of stories -- saints’ lives, political poetry, myth and legend, heroic epic, lament, and placelore -- from ca. 800-1800 C.E. We learn about the changing religious, political, cultural and intellectual contexts to which these Irish women and men responded with their powerful compositions. We ask: what did Irish writers record about their conversion from paganism to Christianity? How did they use Gaelic poetry to protest invasion and English colonization? How did texts created by and about remarkable women like St. Brigit, the warrior-queen Medb, and the keening poet Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill, address issues of gender and power in a heavily patriarchal Ireland? In this class we think about the transformative potential of words, and ask the question: what is literature, and how do we recognize and appreciate it? What defines Irish literature, and what has made it so politically and culturally dynamic? By looking at authors ranging from saints and scholars to dispossessed poets and grieving women, we examine the voices from Ireland’s past that still speak to us today. "
IRLL 20120,"This introductory course to the Short Story literary form, as practiced in Ireland, introduces students to themes and motifs as well as the critical debates associated with the genre from the Revival to WWII.

IRLL 30106,"This class looks at how sex and power operate in Irish literature from the bloodthirsty warrior queens and powerful sovereignty goddesses of medieval saga to the sly civility of the eighteenth century to today's activist punk poets and videographers. We will take particular interest in how women are represented by others and how they choose to answer back, but also look at what that means for ideas of masculinity and relationality. We will consider key genres of Irish verbal art in a wide range of compositions from medieval to contemporary. We will be helped along by relevant literary, anthropological and cultural criticism. Are women's voices (whether by known women or not) subversive of our expectations or intent upon maintaining the status quo? How can we acknowledge and deconstruct misogyny not as inevitable but as historically and contextually conditioned and subject to demystifying critique? What vantage can we gain on Irish literary history by asking these historical, theoretical and political questions? How do tradition and the canon look when we view them through a gendered lens? What kind of impersonations might we engage in when we read...and write? Genres considered include courtly love poetry, contemporary feminist verse, oral lament, modern love poetry, bardic verse, storytelling, early modern allegorical poetry, folk song, medieval allegory, and contemporary comic verse, all read in English. Your own work for the course will include papers of literary/cultural analysis, a presentation, and a creative writing option for those who want to flex those muscles."
IRLL 30118,"Storytelling allows us to make a place, and a past, come alive, and it is through narrative that certain people, locations, and experiences lodge themselves in our memories. How, and why, do we reshape our own environment to convey certain stories about our past, our accomplishments, and our collective experiences? Why is it that road-trips loom so large in American cultural memory, and what do they have in common with other placelore stories, such as those featuring Native Americans, Irish saints and TV characters like Northern Ireland's 'Derry Girls'?  How can words, sounds and imagery be used to map out and draw us into new and often fantastic virtual geographies? In this class, we will think about how stories gain power by being anchored in evocative depictions of specific places, both real and imagined. We will examine verbal and visual stories, from medieval manuscripts like the Book of Kells and tales of St. Patrick's travels around Ireland, to contemporary animation ('Song of the Sea'), murals from Northern Ireland, place-based television series ('Derry Girls') and Chicago-based road-trip films ('The Blues Brothers', 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'). We will contemplate how icons of ancient Ireland were used to create new spaces in Chicago, and we'll look at the massive 1893 World's Fair that put a newly rebuilt Chicago on the world map, as well as dramatic histories of Chicago and some of its murderous inhabitants (Devil in the White City). We will also turn to regional storytelling traditions and will study songs and stories about 'home' composed by those who experienced diaspora and migration."
IRLL 30314,"A cliché, a painful truth, an old story, a new one—this course explores alcohol and alcoholism in Irish literature, Irish society and Irishness, examining how alcohol infuses the stories Irish people tell and those told about them, and asking what happens if we take alcohol(ism) seriously as a framework and topic of analysis. We will think about the romance and conviviality of drink and drinking, pubs and wakes and more; and counterposed crusades against drinking (by Father Mathew and others), as well as the unromantic and destructive dimension so central to recent writing. We will think about alcohol(ism) in relation to political authority and nationalism, as well as in relation to colonial resistance, recalcitrance and recovery. We will ask how this inheritance travels into Irish America, and even to this campus, asking what legacies are being lived out, and why, and what we make of that. The course will feature a diverse set of texts across a span of Irish literary tradition, including medieval and contemporary, fiction and memoir, poetry and prose, verbal, visual and musical media. On the way students will work on their speaking, analytical and writing skills. Course work will include short writing assignments and analytical papers, a presentation, and a creative assignment."

IRST 20116,"Ireland can lay claim to one of the most extensive, unique, and oldest literatures in Europe. By engaging with a wide range of literary texts from the medieval and early modern periods (ca. 800-1800), participants will consider how changing social, cultural, literary and intellectual contexts, in terms of both authors and audiences, have dramatically transformed Ireland's literature over the centuries. By looking at authors ranging from heroic bards and literary monks to lamenting wives and satirizing schoolmasters, we will examine the dynamics of production and the voices that speak to us from Ireland's past. Additionally, by thinking about the identities of those who have more recently translated and edited the versions of the texts we will read, by questioning the different topics that scholars have chosen to explore, and by articulating our own responses to often arresting works from the Irish literary tradition, we will begin to understand the complexities and rich possibilities inherent in experiencing these literary masterpieces in a time and place very different from medieval or early modern Ireland.   Participants will read both primary literary texts, which may include but are not limited to The Táin, stories from Early Irish Myths and Sagas, poems from An Duanaire: Poems of the Dispossessed, Merriman's Midnight Court, as well as a number of critical essays. Participants will be required to write several short response papers, to compose discussion questions to help direct class conversations, and to write 2 papers (4-5 pp. and  6-7 pp.)"

JED 30149,"This course is about telling great, factual stories within the realm of human endeavor we call sport. That is, you will read and write substantial nonfiction narratives, and your main subject of inquiry will be near-at-hand happenings in sport, play, and performance. You can call it longform sportswriting, literary journalism, creative nonfiction, or anything in between—and, indeed, this course will ask you to interrogate the boundaries between subgenres in the literature of fact. Through your ethical efforts in research, exploration, and storytelling, you will seek to define and describe real-world truth through the art of the longform essay. With guidance, you will look for potential stories locally—on campus, or nearby—request access and permission to tell those stories, and gather material en route to crafting meaningful narratives. Together, we will ask fundamental questions about the time-honored act of storytelling and explore the history of the longform narrative form. What impact—culturally, socially, politically—can a well-told story have? We will build personal toolkits for writing nonfiction while reading and discussing exemplary essays. We will ask big questions about the role of sport and play in culture, mindful of local significance: What is the relationship between play and identity, for instance? How do conceptions of race, class, or gender find expression (or deconstruction) in sport? How does socioeconomic division affect access to sport and play in America? Most fundamentally, in this course, we will write and share our work with others. This course requires the completion of a substantial writing project, among other assignments, and you should be prepared to spend time with real people and your writing subjects outside of class time, and often according to their schedules."

KSGA 30004,"The difference between rich and poor nations is not, as Ernest Hemingway once said, that the rich have more money than the poor, but is in part because the rich produce more goods and services. Industrialization, in other words, has often brought wealth (as well as social dislocation and protest) to those who have succeeded. This course examines the process of industrialization from a comparative perspective and integrates the history of industrialization and its social consequences for Western Europe (Britain and Germany), the United States, Latin America (Mexico), and East Asia (Japan and South Korea). We will concentrate on these countries' transition from agriculture-based societies to industrial societies. We will analyze the process of industrialization on two levels from above the role of political authority and from below a view of factory life, industrial relations, and protest from the perspective of workers and the working classes. No specific prerequisites in history or economics are necessary."
KSGA 30200,"This course examines the late 20th and early 21st century economic miracles of several East Asian countries. We will explore similarities, differences, and interdependencies in the development trajectories of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and mainland China, and will debate how accurate and useful concepts like the developmental state and state capitalism are in describing the political economy of the region. To what extent has China's economic rise followed the playbooks of its East Asian neighbors? What human costs and developmental distortions have accompanied booming industrial and urban growth? And what lessons does East Asia's experience offer for the contemporary developing world?"
KSGA 30205,"While there is a wealth of academic work on race, racism, and anti-racism in the domestic realm, there is less attention to them in the international context. This is unfortunate, because they cannot be domestically confined. United Nations resolutions against racism, debates about whether the International Criminal Court is racially biased, and the global wave of anti-racist protests in 2020 are a few examples. This course examines race in the international context, exploring how it affects, is affected by, and is intertwined with central topics in international relations, including human rights, war and peace, foreign policy, international law and international organizations. "
KSGA 30207,"Market-oriented reforms known as ‘neoliberalism’ have dominated the reform agenda across the world. These reforms were passed amidst tremendous political contestations and have delivered varying degrees of success. For the developing countries that faced the additional/simultaneous challenges of building ‘good’ institutions and governance systems, these reforms have resulted in questionable outcomes. Given this, today’s emerging economies have been forced to re-assess the benefits of market-oriented reforms, and those with policy space and political will/capacity have embarked on new reform experiments. The module introduces the students to the complexities and challenges of economic reforms in the fast-growing economies by placing politics at the heart of the analysis. The course is comprised of two parts. The first part provides the theoretical and conceptual foundations for examining the processes and outcomes of economic reforms. It discusses the limitations and dangers of designing and implementing reforms without consideration of the broader concept of states and markets or sufficient engagement with politics. This is because policy always produces new winners and losers, and as a result provokes resistance from those who believe they will lose wealth, status, or power. The second part investigates reforms in key areas of the political economy where there have been significant reforms and where distributive tension and conflicts are rampant. These include privatization, trade liberalization, industrial policies, debt and macroeconomic stabilization, tax and fiscal, and social policy reforms, food and nutrition, among others. Given the importance of national and regional contexts when discussing politics, the course draws cases from a wide range of geographical areas including East Asia, Latin American and Sub-Saharan Africa. The module concludes by examining the implications of factoring politics and local contexts into economic reforms for development policy and management and discusses whether new development paradigms and models exist for emerging economies."
KSGA 30307,"The goal of the course is to compare the processes by which social scientists and filmmakers/photographers engage in social documentation. Students explore how global social problems such as rural and urban poverty, race and gender inequalities, immigration, and violence are analyzed across the social sciences and depicted in a variety of documentary film and photography genres. The course also explores the role that documentary photography and film play in promoting rights and advocating for social change, particularly in the realm of human rights and global inequality. It examines the history of documentary film and photography in relationship to politics and the development of concerns across the social sciences with inequality and social justice. It also looks at how individual documentarians, non-profit organizations, and social movements use film and photography to further their goals and causes as well as issues of representation their choices raise. The course is unique because it requires students to engage in the process of visual documentation themselves by incorporating an activity-based learning component. For their final project, students choose a human rights or social problem that concerns or interests them (and which they can document locally - no travel is required), prepare a documentary exhibit on the chosen topic (10-12 photographs), and write an essay analyzing how social scientists construct and frame the given problem. Students also have the option to produce a short documentary film."
KSGA 30309,"How has the Internet changed the ways people voice their opinions, gather information, and organize social movements? Have marginalized groups become more empowered by mobilizing online? Why does increased social media activity often exacerbate political polarization and populism? How has social media affected national elections? This course will analyze these questions and more within the context of East Asia. In analyzing the impact of the Internet on state-society relations, students will analyze state attempts to control media consumption and surveil Internet-use in Communist regimes like North Korea and China. We will compare these trends with similar efforts made by state actors in advanced industrialized countries such as Japan and South Korea. While the Internet-usage is in many ways, still tightly regulated by the state, the Web has in many ways, also empowered people formerly detached from politics to become politically engaged. This has led to both political polarization (and the influx of political extremist groups), as well as large-scale grassroots movements for democratization. Along these lines, we will examine the growth of far-right netizen groups in Japan, South Korea, and China and the subsequent proliferation of hate crimes, populism, and ultra-nationalism. We will also read studies of how teenagers used their presence on social media and the blogosphere to eventually lead large-scaled national protests like the 2016 Candlelight Movement in Seoul and the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. Finally, in studying the global diffusion of social protests in the digital age, we will analyze how the #MeToo movement reignited new waves of feminism in South Korea, Japan, and China. What implications does the Internet have for the future democracy?"
KSGA 30409,"This course examines the most important bilateral relationship in the world today. It begins with an overview of the major historic episodes in U.S.-China relations, then, adopting a theme-based approach, it examines the relationship among important topics in the contemporary bilateral relationship across the overlapping political, economic and security spheres. The course will stress the importance of perceptions in policymaking, and use student presentations and a crisis simulation to allow students to understand the problem from various perspectives."
KSGA 30414,"Enrolling in school does not guarantee that children acquire the human capital that their schooling should provide. Also, in some countries a large fraction of children still are not finishing primary school, and there are still millions of children who never attend school at all. In this course, we will review the impact of various types of educational interventions on schooling in the Global South. We explore the rationale behind specific policies and the evidence (or lack of) in support of their effectiveness in improving education outcomes. The aim is to engage in broader debates on the challenges facing effective education policy. Students will critically evaluate real-life policy options in different contexts, as well as propose potential innovations. By the end of the course, students will possess an analytical framework that allows them to think clearly about the impacts of alternative education policies, as well as be able to judge the quality of existing evidence."
KSGA 30492,"This course will examine the compounding challenges and injustices affecting the most fragile countries in the world, including extreme poverty, forced migration, climate change, violent conflict, economic collapse, and corruption. Students will analyze diplomatic, development and national security policies of the United States to respond.  One specific policy students will study is the Global Fragility Act of 2019 now being implemented by the Department of State and other federal agencies. In addition, the curriculum will incorporate the foreign policy priorities of the newly formed 117th Congress and the White House, as either the 2nd term of President Trump or the new Biden Administration roll out its goals for the next four years.  Students will navigate the legal, political and media contexts in which policies to address global fragility are shaped; analyze the policymaking process within the U.S.; and employ strategies for communicating about policy.  Understanding the role of evidence-based research to influence interagency policy will be a primary focus. In this regard, students will sharpen their ability to analyze primary source policy documents and formulate key questions at the center of global policy development.  They will grapple with existing and proposed laws, evaluate current policy debates, and produce policy materials.  This course is not a lecture class. It will be interactive, include instruction based on current and historical policy initiatives, and welcome guest speakers who are current or former practitioners in US government agencies, international humanitarian organizations, multilateral organizations, or policy think tanks."
KSGA 30493,"This course explores the myriad of national security policy challenges facing the United States and the policy options to address these challenges. The course will explore security  issues with Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as well as climate change, global health/pandemics, cyber threats/security and terrorism/extremism. The course will include lectures by policy experts and student engagement with these experts to explore policy options and their potential for success. Students will conduct research of primary source policy documents to develop  a policy memorandum for the US National Security Council that will outline a policy challenge for the United States and recommend policy options for consideration."
KSGA 30604,"This course examines US engagement in hotspots across the Muslim world before and after 9/11. In particular focus are nations in South Asia and the Middle East: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq. We will also look at US relations with important Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, as well as policies toward Israel-Palestine and the Bosnian War in Europe. US engagement abroad takes many forms, including public diplomacy, trade, sanctions, alliances, covert operations, financial and military aid, and direct military intervention. What are the drivers of American decision-making in the region? Why is there so much anti-American sentiment in Muslim societies? Does peace depend on a critical reassessment of US foreign policy or the reform of a radical Islamist theology? Do certain interpretations of religion make conflict inevitable, or is it possible to attain reasonable outcomes even when dealing with extremists? Through a blend of history, investigative journalism, case studies, opinion polls, literature, and film, this course broadens our perspectives on some of America's longest wars in the Muslim world."
KSGA 30608,"The study of religious beliefs and practices in tribal and peasant societies emphasizing myths, ritual, symbolism, and magic as ways of explaining man's place in the universe. Concepts of purity and pollution, the sacred and the profane, and types of ritual specialists and their relation to social structure will also be examined."
KSGA 40301,"What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films. Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba)."
KSGA 40493,"Economists used to believe that a certain level of inequality was the price of doing business in a market economy. They presumed that the clever entrepreneur should be rewarded for their ingenuity and ability to create value. Today, however, the world is seeing unprecedented levels of inequality and concentrations of wealth that are distorting markets, undermining democratic institutions, polarizing citizens, and driving increasing unemployment, homelessness and deaths of despair. Such concentrations of wealth have not been seen since the eve of the Great Depression. Suddenly, political leaders and economists are worried. Why? This course will try to answer the following questions: 1) what were the factors that have created the accelerating growth of inequality both domestically and globally?; 2)  What are its most significant manifestations and impacts?; 3) And what is or must be done to address the challenges inequality poses both at home and abroad?"

The primary objective of the course is to introduce law students to the principal legal issues raised in protecting vital national security interests, and the tension that often arises between national security and civil liberties.  More specifically, the course examines five important levers of governmental power utilized in combatting national security threats: diplomacy; intelligence; military; economic sanctions (both domestic and international); and criminal prosecution.  Further, important national security law issues will be analyzed within a framework of six different friction points, which involve a balancing of important competing interests that arise in attempting to detect, prevent, and combat serious threats to national security.  These friction points include: (1) the friction between the branches of government, and frictions within branches of government; (2) the friction between national security and liberty; (3) the friction between separate sovereigns: national security and federalism; (4) the friction between national security and open government; (5) the friction between economic freedom and national security; and (6) the friction between national security and international law.  The course will also bring together core principles of separation of powers, justiciability, regulatory law, criminal law, First Amendment law, constitutional due process, and principles of international law, to name only a few, as they relate to issues of national security."
LAW 70328,"This two-credit course provides an overview of American water law and policy.  Water is an essential resource, yet the law that deals with its protection and allocation is neither coherent nor consistent across the fifty states.  Just as population growth and industrial expansion have strained the nation's limited freshwater supplies, so also have they tested the laws established to manage these supplies.  Today water law is called upon not only to resolve disputes among competing users, but also to help maintain adequate supplies of clean water in the face of widespread and chronic pollution, disappearing aquifers, and rapidly growing demand.  In this course, we will examine these issues by studying, among other things, the classic water allocation doctrines of riparianism and prior appropriation (as well as variations that apply to ground water), interstate controversies over shared water resources, public rights and interests in water resources, and the law governing the major institutions and organizations involved in water allocation and management. "

LAW 70399,"This course offers a comparative perspective on law and legal institutions. Looking comparatively helps shed light on our own system and question what is normal or natural. From what it means to be a lawyer to notions of what is just or fair, courts and dispute resolution outside the U.S. can be both very different and, at times, surprisingly familiar. After an overview of concepts and classic approaches to the study of law and society, the course will explore these differences and similarities in three Asian settings: China, Japan, and India. Topics include courts and the legal profession, crime, inequality, and environmental protection, to see how each country's history, political structure, values, and interests shape how legal issues are defined and play out."

Among the issues discussed are: confidentiality, conflict of interests, unpopular clients, lawyers' speech and advertising, admission to and regulation of the bar, and responsibilities to some special clients. The course examines the ABA Model Rules and relevant cases. In an attempt to uncover the foundation that might be claimed to underpin the rules, a spectrum of philosophical, theological, pragmatic and utilitarian theories are considered.

LAW 70812,"Are law students preparing to participate in the tradition of a noble profession or merely training to be skilled manipulators of language, concepts, and other people?  This course will inquire about the philosophy of law; the nature and possible distinctiveness of legal reasoning; the purpose of law and lawyering in society; and the perplexity of many contemporary students, scholars, and practicing lawyers in the face of such questions.   To pursue these questions, this course will draw on writings in jurisprudence and the history of ideas ranging from Plato to postmodernism, as well as judicial opinions that turn abstract ideas into legal action.  This course aspires to give students the opportunity to ensure that their legal lives do not go unexamined."
LAW 70831,"Canon law, beyond reflecting the pastoral concerns, doctrinal teachings and administrative structures of the Catholic Church, represents a broad area of study, particularly for those interested in the history and development of law. This course will offer students an opportunity to examine the rich and complex sources of canon law, giving them a glimpse into the development of law within the Western world. From the earliest Christian collections of the Didache and the Apostolic Constitutions, to the inclusion of Roman and Byzantine law, the Codex and Digesta of Justinian, through the work of the medieval scholars, the course will examine the most important texts in the development of canon law. The course will be divided into the traditional categories of fontes essendi (sources from which the law originates, such as ecumenical councils and papal decrees) and fontes cognoscendi (the actual works to be consulted for the study of the history of canon law, i.e., Gratian's Decretum). We will also examine theories and philosophies of law in the writings of Gratian, St. Thomas Aquinas (S.Th, I-II; qq. 90-97) and the later scholastics, to see how theories of natural law are integrated into the legal tradition of the Catholic Church. We will also examine the interaction between law and the lived experience of the Church, particularly in the missionary efforts of the 16th-17th centuries. Readings will be distributed electronically each week, in accord with the actual progress made in each lecture. Coursework will include 5 short essays throughout the semester, which will represent the 25 % of the final grade. The final examination of the course will be a paper (length 2500-3000); students will have the opportunity to discuss their paper topic with the instructor, collaborate on sources and submit a draft for comments, before the final due date."
LAW 70833,"Like any organized society, the Catholic Church has developed its own legal system which, beyond providing structure and regulating its sacramental life, also includes sanctions for specific behaviors which are deemed to threaten the good order of the community. This course provides an overview of the fundamental principles of the law of the Catholic Church, the various offices and structures in the Church, questions of administration, the use of temporal goods, the celebration of the Sacraments and penal and procedural law. Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to demonstrate a basic understanding of the role of law in the Church, understand the basic concepts of church governance on the parish, diocesan and universal levels and exhibit a working knowledge of church structure and management, the regulation of ecclesiastical goods and the sacraments, as well as procedural and penal law. The unique element of this course is that all of the knowledge of canon law will be given in relation to the most pressing issues of religious liberty in the American context. We will examine questions like: How does the priest-penitent privilege correspond to the seal of the sacrament of confession? How is internal church structure constituted reflected in the civil incorporation of the church, and how has this impacted the church (bankruptcy, etc.)? How does the church use the ministerial exemption in structuring work contracts? How does the Church's teaching on marriage impact its ability to interact with state laws governing marriage, given the contemporary legal landscape? How does the Church interact with states and as a participant in international bodies (U.N., etc.)?"
LAW 70841,"This course examines the origins of Anglo-American law, focusing on legal institutions and procedures from the Norman Conquest through the twentieth century. Readings include primary historical sources and scholarly commentary. Two themes lie at the heart of this course: the rise and decline of trial by jury; and the development of the legal profession. These themes correspond to several questions facing the legal profession today. Should lawyers worry that few cases are resolved by jury trial? Is our current system of legal education the best way to train future lawyers? Why do law firms rely on the billable hour? After successfully completing this course, you will have the historical knowledge and analytical skills to grapple with these and other crucial questions about the trajectory of the common-law tradition."
LAW 70902,"Introduces students to the new behavioral analysis of law. A behavioral approach to legal analysis asserts that the efficacy of the law depends on its understanding of relevant patterns of human behavior. We will review the ways in which the scientific study of human judgment and decision making can inform the creation and modification of legal rules and institutions.  	The behavioral approach differs from both its economic counterpart and traditional legal scholarship: From the former, in recognizing the decision makers are neither strictly rational nor the maximizers of their own utility alone; from the latter, in proposing an empirically based view of human behavior as the foundation of relevant analyses. We will examine critically how behavioral findings on systematic patterns of behavior that deviates from strictly rational utility maximization are applied to the law, recognizing the unique promise of this approach as well as the current limitations of its methodology. 	Specifically, the course will open with an overview of behavioral decision theory - the psychological study of human judgment and decision making. Thereafter, we will examine a variety of rules and doctrines in different legal fields. Following this overview, we will evaluate the new behavioral approach - its nature and scope, its achievements and limitations - and consider the implications of our evaluation for some overarching questions of legal policy."
LAW 70908,"The Intercollegiate Externship will provide an opportunity for law students to gain practical experience and academic credit in intercollegiate athletics administration through a classroom component taught by Law School faculty and senior-level administrator-attorneys from Athletics and via non-classroom externship work.

LAW 70919,"In June 2020, prompted by the horrific killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, our nation has awakened to the brutality of institutional racism and the violence to human dignity it has wrought in communities of color throughout America's history. Individuals who had previously failed to recognize and understand the structures of racism are now seeking to educate themselves. This course will meet members of this wider population where they are and guide them toward a fuller commitment to civil and human rights. Structured as a weekly guest-lecture series featuring authors, public intellectuals, faith leaders, external and internal members of the academy, the course will engage students weekly with an event or concept necessary to understand and dismantle systemic racism.The lecture-and-dialogue series is, by design, a sophisticated, interdisciplinary introduction to systemic racism, addressed to students with curious minds and noble hearts who have been naive about the depths of racism. The series is meant to cover the range of issues that must be understood and addressed in order for us to build a vocabulary of racial justice as a mental guide to creating a just society. In each class period, the instructor will begin with an introduction of the week's guest expert. The guest expert will then present roughly thirty minutes of opening remarks that dissect a Word of the Week. Included among the words will be broad, relatively familiar terms such as institutional racism and intersectionality. Pending expert availability, other topics may include voter suppression, redlining, health disparities, qualified immunity, faith and racism, athletic protests, Tulsa, Flint, global racism, mass incarceration, monuments, 1619, Jim Crow, and so on. Following the introductory remarks, the guest lecturer will respond to student questions for the remainder of the class. At the conclusion of each session, the instructor will ask the guest lecturer to leave the class with Three Musts, must-reads, must-watch, or must listens on the word of the week, or on anti-racism more generally. The entire course will be offered via zoom for all participants. In addition to attending the weekly guest lectures, students will also participate in three small-group sessions during the course of the semester."
LAW 73107,"This course offers a bottom-up, agency-centered perspective on the administrative process that is designed to complement the top-down, court-centered perspective of a traditional administrative law class. The field of administrative law typically focuses on the role of federal courts in reviewing and constraining agency action. While this focus is understandable and valuable, it renders invisible many of the legal issues that lawyers encounter when they practice in or before federal agencies. The primary goal of this seminar is to expose students to a wide range of these usually invisible legal issues. Topics will include the historical and legal foundations of the modern administrative state, the proper separation of authority to determine how the administrative process operates, the scope and use of agency discretion to design or embellish procedures in rulemaking and adjudication, the scope and enforcement of publication and information-sharing requirements, and the unique challenges and opportunities presented to administration by the Internet and electronic communications. Beyond its substance, this course is designed to give students the opportunity to further develop the reading and writing skills that are needed in an administrative or regulatory practice. Students will read scholarly work on administrative law and regulatory practice, along with the occasional judicial opinion. Most of the reading for the course, however, will come in the form of unedited government documents, including statutes, regulations, executive orders, agency guidance documents, government agency reports, and Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) recommendations. Immersion in these primary sources offer the opportunity for students to develop some fluency in the style and conventions of government writing. Students will also be required to write frequently over the course of the semester and, in groups, to prepare and submit a comment to ACUS on an ongoing recommendation project."
LAW 73117,"This course is an introduction to the law of equity. The word equity means many different things, including (1) an adjustment in an exceptional case unforeseen by a legislator, (2)the idea of fairness or justice, and (3) the doctrines and remedies developed by the English courts of equity. In this course the focus is on the third, that is, equityin the technical sense, though the other meanings are also relevant to the development and use of equitable doctrines and remedies. Although there will be historical materials in this course, equity is not being studied as a historical subject. The U.S. Constitution (the 7th Amendment), many federal and state statutes, and many judicially developed doctrines all require - right now, in 2019 - some understanding of equity and its doctrines. This course is meant to give you that understanding. The law of equity is found across the common law world (including England, Australia, and Canada), and so readings will also come from other common law legal systems."
LAW 73119,"Corporate law today is an international endeavor. Transnational corporations require transnational legal counsel, many MandA transactions involve foreign buyers or foreign targets. Regulators cooperate across the Atlantic, policy proposals are increasingly promoted with a view to developments in other regions of the world. The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Economic, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) movements, ground-shaking developments in corporate law, are driven by international rules and regulations such as frameworks published by the United Nations. In other words: having a feeling for different corporate-governance regimes and traditions and the international contexts corporate law evolves in allows us to better understand today's world of corporate law, whether from a practitioner's point of view or through the lenses of an academic or policy maker. This course aims to provide an introduction to comparative corporate governance, including forays into bankruptcy and securities regulation. We will discuss a variety of classics and cutting-edge issues driving corporate and financial law today: stakeholder vs. shareholder value and participation of labor; corporate liability for human rights violations, CSR, and ESG; corporate groups, etc."
LAW 73135,"Focuses on fundamental questions about how, if at all, existing legal rules should apply to new technologies. Explores various legal and policy problems that arise in cyberspace including: issues of sovereignty and jurisdiction; legal and technological regulation of on-line speech; issues of privacy, anonymity and accountability; computer crime; and ownership and protection of intellectual property in digital form."
LAW 73136,"This course will examine the legal intersection between cybersecurity, privacy, and compliance from a practitioner's standpoint. In particular, the course will focus on the processing of data by organizations and how such processing may be affected by select cybersecurity and data privacy laws, regulations, and industry standards."
LAW 73141,"The course examines the legal implications arising from the increasing use of online platforms to carry out transactions, conclude contracts and conduct other kinds of human interaction. The spread of online platforms, and particularly of those based on the concept of a “code”, could lead to a discarding of principles and rules traditionally seen as providing the default order. In light of this process, it can be asked whether there is a need for the creation of a new system of law, one in which principles and rules thus far considered secondary could, in the near future, play a primary role. The course will also engage in a detailed analysis evaluating the interaction between code and law, thus examining the alternative concepts of “code as law” and “code of law”. The depicted scenario raises challenges for regulators and policymakers. They must confront the challenge of foreseeing and eventually regulating the functioning of online platforms in society to ensure that they are human-centric, ethical, explainable, sustainable and respectful of fundamental rights and values. The expected goal is that students will become acquainted with the interplay between legal principles vis-à-vis online platforms, with an awareness of the potential conflict engendered by the contraposition between law’s traditional way of thinking and that endorsed by the operators of online platforms."
LAW 73142,"The concept of ‘European digital constitutionalism’ provides a useful lens through which it is possible to analyse the developments in European Union (EU) law related to the regulation of digital technologies and of the information society. Combining the logics of the market and of rights, European digital constitutionalism has become a driving force of the EU’s digital policy. An essential component of European digital constitutionalism is the caselaw of the Court of justice of the EU, which progressively develops a number of entitlements - i.e. both substantial rights and procedural guarantees- of the Internet user. These entitlements are constructed by the Court, in the light of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as a particular ‘fundamental status’, protecting individual autonomy, e-privacy and control over one’s personal data. The new set of digital rights can be conceptualised as a European digital citizenship, understood as ‘the right to have rights’ in society online."

LAW 73301,"This course explores the nature and significance of state constitutional law.  The course covers rights and structure, and in both settings it compares the federal model to the various state models. Of particular emphasis is the role of the state courts in protecting liberty and property rights under their own constitutions, and most notably whether they should construe these guarantees to offer protections that the federal courts have not provided in construing the federal constitution. Examples include litigation involving school funding, marriage, property takings, criminal procedure, the free exercise of religion, among others. The course also considers the amendment procedures of the state constitutions, the election of state court judges, the non-unitary executive under most state constitutions and other structural issues."

LAW 73428,"The very origins of international law lie in the attempt to control major violence between communities. Thus, international law on the use of force is the oldest of the major subfields of general international law. It is also the area that makes headlines most often today from the violence of civil wars to the development of killer robots. International law on the use of force is relevant to the military, legislators, judges, human rights advocates, the media, ethicists, manufacturers, service providers, and a well-informed electorate. Our course will cover the three main areas within the subfield: the law governing resort to force (jus ad bellum), the conduct of armed conflict (jus in bello or International Humanitarian Law (IHL)), and the means and methods of warfare, in particular, weapons law.  The course is designed as an advanced international law course. It aims to give students a deeper and broader understanding of international law as well as providing an opportunity to hone skills in legal reasoning, research, and advocacy—written and oral. At the midpoint of the course, students will be assigned a current controversy and asked to present a legal case on one side of the controversy or the other in a moot and for analysis in a research paper. Grades are based on three components: class participation, the oral presentation, and the final paper.    This is a two-credit our course that will meet once a week. A prior course in international law is required. The prior course need not have been at Notre Dame but must have been a general introduction covering how international law is made, applied, and enforced. "
LAW 73449,"This course approaches Comparative Constitutional Law from a qualitative and foundational perspective. The goal is to consider certain constitutional issues that really matter, to try to understand them better, and to explore their potential strengths and weaknesses - for which purposes a natural law perspective will be preferred (without prejudice to others). If that is the goal, it is not about how many jurisdictions one picks for this comparative venture; it is about how much one can learn from those selected. In other words, it is not so much about the quantity of comparisons as it is about having a topic deserving to be compared on account of its worth and relevance. The US Constitution will be the permanent point of reference for the several comparisons; structural matters will receive more attention that those immediately concerning rights (which receive closer attention in other, human rights related classes). The topics to be analyzed will include the natural law foundations of comparative constitutionalism, federalism, judicial review, and the restriction of property rights during emergencies."

Students learn truth tables and see an effective procedure that they could apply to any argument stated in propositional logic, to determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.  There is nothing like truth tables for predicate logic.  Students get to experience doing what mathematicians do, trying to determine whether a particular conclusion follows from some premises by searching simultaneously for a proof or a counterexample. Writing papers gives students an opportunity to explore other topics in logic of their interest. "

MATH 30210,"Operations research is the science (and art) of decision making. The success of a decision is frequently quantified through an achievement of certain goals (objectives) under restrictions imposed on various resources. Thus, mathematical models of operations research are frequently described as optimization problems, i.e. problems of minimization (maximization) of an objective function subject to various constraints. In this course we will consider optimization problems most frequently arising in various applications. Namely, linear programming problems, i.e. problems of minimization of a linear function subject to linear constraints. We will discuss in detail the simplex algorithm for solving linear programming problems and duality theory (optimality conditions).  The Transportation Problem is a particular case of a linear programming which has various applications and specific algorithms. The Assignment Problem is an important example of so-called discrete optimization problems which can be solved using ideas of linear programming. We discuss both problems in detail.  Game Theory is typically used in decision making with conflicting interests. We will discuss two person zero-sum games and show how the simplex algorithm can be used to solve them.

MDSC 30114,"As artificial intelligence (AI) grows increasingly pervasive in society, it is essential that we develop an understanding of how AI systems work. A vital part of this understanding is a careful consideration of various risks (e.g., the presence of bias, a lack of transparency, regulatory compliance) when AI systems are designed and deployed in real-world settings. To understand and address these concerns, this course introduces students to the fundamentals of AI auditing — the practice of evaluating and improving the ethics of AI systems. Through a combination of interactive discussions and semi-technical lab sessions, students will develop an auditing “toolkit”. This toolkit includes both theoretical and technical concepts, especially relevant for the increasingly interdisciplinary teams of the modern workforce. Students will work on group case assignments as “audit committees” that reflect the needs of a variety of stakeholders (e.g., developers, managers, investors, users). Groups will identify and discuss potential concerns or risks associated with AI systems as well as develop recommendations to address them. Overall, the course aims to provide an interdisciplinary and hands-on introduction to AI auditing, allowing students to gain insights into the opportunities and challenges associated with the design and deployment of AI systems that minimize societal risk and increase their effectiveness."
MDSC 30161,"Football is one of the most enduringly popular and significant cultural activities in the United States. Since the late 19th century, football has occupied an important place for those wishing to define and understand America. And Notre Dame football plays a central role in that story, with larger-than-life figures and stories, from Knute Rocknes. Win one for the Gipper line to the Four Horsemen backfield that led the program to a second national championship in 1924. The mythic proportions of the University's football program cast a long shadow on the institution's history, cultural significance, and traditions. This course focuses on Notre Dame football history as an entry point into larger questions about the cultural, historical, and social significance of football in the U.S. Who has been allowed to play on what terms? How have events from Notre Dame football's past been remembered and re-imagined? How has success in Notre Dame football been defined and redefined? In particular, the course will focus on how Notre Dame football became a touchstone for Catholic communities and institutions across the country navigating the fraught terrain of immigration, whiteness, and religious practice. This course will take up those questions through significant engagement with University Archive collections related to Notre Dame football, working toward increased levels of description and access for these materials. This course will include hands-on work with metadata, encoding and markup, digitization, and digital preservation/access through a collaboration with the University Archives and the Navari Family Center for Digital Scholarship.

MDSC 43990,"Social networks are an increasingly important form of social organization. Social networks help to link persons with friends, families, co-workers and formal organizations. Via social networks information flows, support is given and received, trust is built, resources are exchanged, and interpersonal influence is exerted. Rather than being static, social networks are dynamic entities. They change as people form and dissolve social ties to others during the life course. Social networks have always been an important part of social life:  in our kinship relations, our friendships, at work, in business, in our communities and voluntary associations, in politics, in schools, and in markets. Our awareness of and ability to study social networks has increased dramatically with the advent of social media and new communication tools through which people interact with others. Through email, texting, Facebook, Twitter and other platforms, people connect and communicate with others and leave behind traces of those interactions. This provides a rich source of data that we can use to better understand our connections to each other; how these connections vary across persons and change over time; and the impact that they have on our behaviors, attitudes, and tastes. This course will introduce students to (1) important substantive issues about, and empirical research on, social networks; (2) theories about network evolution and network effects on behavior; and (3) tools and methods that students can use to look at and analyze social networks. The course will be a combination of lectures, discussions and labs. Course readings will include substantive research studies, theoretical writings, and methodological texts. Through this course students will learn about social networks by collecting data on social networks and analyzing that data."

MGA 60136,"Human beings experience peace and conflicts comprehensively, they touch human life in all aspects of existence. While dominant models of inquiry have privileged the use of disembodied reason, this course will consider what new avenues emerge when the role of the body in the production of knowledge is centered. Based on John Paul Lederach's Moral Imagination and expanding on the Kroc Institute's approach towards reflective peace building, this course will introduce students to humanistic and decolonial methods to peace building research and practice. Through somatic practice students will actively engage embodied knowing.  Following the model of the scholar-practitioner students will study the conceptual foundations and applications of comprehensive embodied practices for peacebuilding. They will engage with the ontological, epistemological and ethical foundations of embodied research and their integration into research designs via qualitative methods. Emphasis will be placed on auto-ethnographic, decolonial, reflective and performative methodologies.   Through the practice of dance (conscious dance), theatre (Theatre for Living/Theatre of the Oppressed) and breath (transpersonal approaches) students will come to understand how topics of peace and conflict are held, expressed and transformed through the body. Taught in experiential manner within a facilitated workshop setting, this course also requires openness for embodied self-exploration through dance, theatre and breath as well as openness for group-dynamics. No previous experience with embodied practices required. All levels of physical ability welcome."
MGA 60139,"Why is talking about climate change without reference to colonial pasts an incomplete conversation? Why is a forward-looking climate justice conversation incomplete unless it is also looking back? How does coloniality present today? How does the global south figure in writing on climate change? Can there be a role for the global south in the climate justice conversation that recognizes its vulnerability to climate change but goes beyond portraying it as always and only vulnerable, devastated and/or menacing? In this class we will begin with the premise that the answer is yes: not only is such a role possible, but it must actively be created if the climate justice conversation is to an inclusive one. Examining representations of climate refugees, extreme weather events, and imagined geographies of conflicts, and informed by scholarship on racialized constructions of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ migrants, in this class we will collectively work through the intersections between the political and ecological that today determine the movement of humans, capital, and knowledge. Our collective endeavor will be to: (i) understand writing on climate change with a focus on its implicit (yet predominant) threat and risk imaginaries; (ii) question the role of the global south in such writing; and (iii) craft a lexicon that is cognizant of colonial pasts and their continuity, and relates geographies, histories and politics in more equal ways."
MGA 60141,"What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films. Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba)."
MGA 60148,"This course explores the theory and practice of community peacemaking. It covers the benefits, challenges and methods of local peacemaking, as well as the relationship between peacemaking and peacebuilding. Content will draw on practitioner experience in South Africa, South Bend and elsewhere. Guest lecturers will include community activists from South Bend."
MGA 60149,"Could business be an instrument of peace or is it more likely to be an agent of division that foments conflict? While the course will touch on questions of whether trade and economic development as well as different economic systems impact causes of violence, the class focuses specifically on the role of for-profit and non-profit institutions within the context of current economic systems. This course draws upon three perspectives to undertake a 360-degree assessment of this question about business's role. First, it will examine the ways in which the actions of business exploit populations, profit from war-making, and sometimes actively engage in the promotion of violence. Second, it looks at an area of academic inquiry sometimes called Business For Peace, in which the ways in which businesses can be instruments of peace have been explored. The ways businesses might do this include being more actively involved in peacemaking and peacekeeping in zones of conflict as well as more general, incremental forms of peacebuilding that could occur both in and outside of zones of conflict. Third, the course looks at newer, nuanced theories from political theorists that assess the positives and negatives of the role of business in engagement in peace."
MGA 60150,"The course explores the Christian contribution (or difference) to efforts towards peace in the world. The course has two parts. Part one is a theoretical exploration of the history and assumptions that sustain the discussion of theology and peacebuilding. Behind this formulation is the assumption that theology and peace-building constitute two independent disciplines each with its own field of investigation, unique methodologies and criteria for rational inquiry. However, once the discussion is set up within these parameters, theology cannot but be reduced to simply providing a useful contribution- an add on to an independently derived and more primary realm of peace. The critical thrust of this first section will be to show that the political and ideological assumptions of peacebuilding (and thus peace studies generally understood) do not often allow for a full appreciation of theology as a way of life, grounded in and shaped by a matrix of practices and disciplines, whose overall effect is meant to shape the Christian into a vision and patterns of peace in the world. The constructive direction of the section will be to point to a more complex, multi-layered and at times contested relationship between theology and peacebuilding. In the second part, using representative stories of individuals and communities, the course will explore the theological matrix that informs and sustains the Christian practice of peace. Among others, the scriptural imagination, lament, hope, and conversion will be identified as key disciplines within this matrix. But because these disciplines are produced and reproduced in the habitual practices of the church, it makes Christian peacebuilding a form of improvisation which takes place within particular, local and specific contexts. The stories display not only the inner logic of a Christian theology of peace, but the multiple possibilities of Christian peacebuilding efforts in the world."
MGA 60201,"This course provides a cross-disciplinary examination of issues central to sustainable development, providing students with a firm grounding in the concepts, methods, frameworks, and findings of the field. The class will critically engage with the work of development scholars and practitioners on the measurement and determinants of sustainable development. We will examine efforts by policy makers, international organizations, and practitioners to promote human wellbeing in an inclusive and sustainable manner, with an emphasis on critical issues connected to research and practice. The course also provides opportunities to read and write about issues and areas that are distinctive in their own right, but which have particular relevance to sustainable development. "
MGA 60202,"What explains the vast disparity in income and human well-being across countries? What programs are most successful in reducing poverty, pollution, or infant mortality? Do patterns of hiring show evidence of gender and racial bias? What are the human tolls of global and domestic conflict? Examining and answering these and other social science and global policy questions in a rigorous way require quantitative data analysis. This course introduces the basic principles of statistical inference and programming skills for data analysis. The goal of this course is to provide students with the foundation necessary to analyze data in their own research and to become critical consumers of statistical claims made in the news media, in policy reports, and in academic research."
MGA 60203,"This course uses the tools of economic analysis to illustrate how markets work to allocate goods and services in an economy, and to understand the circumstances under which market forces may or may not lead to socially optimal outcomes. Students will discuss when and how governments should intervene in market processes, and analyze the consequences of policies such as taxes, subsidies and price controls. Course assignments include exams, problem sets, policy memos, in-class quizzes and a policy analysis project. This class requires no prior exposure to economics."
MGA 60206,"Deforestation, Desertification, Drought, Unsustainable Agriculture, Pollution, Extinction, Invasive Species, Depletion of Fossil Fuels, Overpopulation, Wildfires, Oil Spills - the list goes on! These complex environmental issues are directly tied to Climate Change.  Global climate change is one of the biggest environmental crises confronting the 21st century world. It is multifaceted and intricately connected to many environmental crises. The overarching goal of this course is to foster an interdisciplinary understanding of climate change, its intimate relationships with other environmental challenges, and policy approaches for mitigating and adapting to its impacts. The course will address questions such as: How are humans contributing to climate/environmental change? How do the social, economic, and political processes shape climate/environmental change across the globe? What policies can help society to mitigate or adapt to climate/environmental change? How do regulatory, market-based, and incentive driven policies influence climate change outcomes? How do state and non-state actors (governments, private sector, communities, activists etc) respond to climate/environmental change?"
MGA 60320,"This course provides students with a firm grounding in the concepts, arguments, methods, and findings in global governance research. The course begins by illuminating the challenge of governance at the global level by introducing central orienting concepts that include anarchy, interdependence, and collective action. Students will become familiar with the principal actors that generate global governance arrangements, including sovereign states, international organizations, civil society actors, and the private sector, and the variety of institutional forms that govern global issues, including formal and informal arrangements. The course provides an overview of central global governance topics, including the environment, global health, trade and industrial policy, and security. "
MGA 60708,"What role does international law have in the advancement of human rights, and how does human rights, in turn, advance international law? This course introduces university students to the general system of modern international law (e.g. its norm-generating framework involving States and non-State actors; the roles of many State and non-State authoritative decision-makers in shaping expectations of peaceful, just, and responsible behavior in the international system; its varied constellation of dispute settlement courts and tribunals, alongside the prospects and limits of enforcing State compliance with international decisions), specifically viewed from the lens of historic global, regional, and domestic challenges to human dignity that influenced the first global codification of human rights norms under the United Nations' 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, up to the present development of the current international system of protection for human rights.  The course situates the framework of modern international law and civil, political, economic, social, and cultural human rights, using five examples of the historic, defining, and 'constitutionalizing moments' for the international system: 1) the international abolition of slavery; 2) the evolution from classical to modern international law in dismantling colonial empires to enshrine the self-determination of all peoples and the equality of sovereignty of all nations; 3) the outlawing of the aggressive use of force since 1929, towards the peaceful settlement of maritime and territorial disputes and the humanitarian rules applicable to armed conflict situations; 4) the establishment of international accountability of individuals and States for genocide, crimes against humanity and other human rights atrocities; and 5) the global regulation for sustainable use, shared protection, and intergenerational responsibility over natural resources (land, oceans, atmosphere, outer space)."

The course will give special attention to the politics, economics and security interests of China in Africa's 54 countries. It will examine the methods and objectives China has employed in Africa, African countries' response to China, and the perceptions of both sides. At the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the development and current state of China-Africa relations, where China excels and where it faces major challenges.  Students will also learn how China interacts with African regional and sub-regional organizations and other emerging non-African powers on the continent.  Finally, they should have some understanding of the implications of China in Africa for the United States and the West generally. Topics in the overlapping political, economic and security spheres will be examined. Questions investigated include: How do Chinese policymakers see Africa and its place in China's foreign policy? What are Chinese objectives in Africa? What methods does China use to achieve its objectives in Africa? Why and how do China's foreign policies differ from country to country? How have African countries responded to China's expanded economic and political presence on the continent? How have domestic political and economic changes in China and in African countries helped shape its relations with African countries? How have African countries sought to achieve their objectives vis-a-vis China and how successful have they been? The deliverables for this class are two written policy briefs, an oral presentation, and class participation.

MGA 60823,"In June 2020, prompted by the horrific killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, our nation has awakened to the brutality of institutional racism and the violence to human dignity it has wrought in communities of color throughout America's history. Individuals who had previously failed to recognize and understand the structures of racism are now seeking to educate themselves. This course will meet members of this wider population where they are and guide them toward a fuller commitment to civil and human rights. Structured as a weekly guest-lecture series featuring authors, public intellectuals, faith leaders, external and internal members of the academy, the course will engage students weekly with an event or concept necessary to understand and dismantle systemic racism.  The lecture-and-dialogue series is, by design, a sophisticated, interdisciplinary introduction to systemic racism, addressed to students with curious minds and noble hearts who have been naive about the depths of racism . The series is meant to cover the range of issues that must be understood and addressed in order for us to build a vocabulary of racial justice as a mental guide to creating a just society.    In each class period, the instructor will begin with an introduction of the week's guest expert. The guest expert will then present roughly thirty minutes of opening remarks that dissect a Word of the Week. Included among the words will be broad, relatively familiar terms such as institutional racism and intersectionality. Pending expert availability, other topics may include voter suppression, redlining, health disparities, qualified immunity, faith and racism, athletic protests, Tulsa, Flint, global racism, mass incarceration, monuments, 1619, Jim Crow, and so on.  Following the introductory remarks, the guest lecturer will respond to student questions for the remainder of the class.  At the conclusion of each session, the instructor will ask the guest lecturer to leave the class with Three Musts, must-reads, must-watch, or must listens on the word of the week, or on anti-racism more generally.  The entire course will be offered via zoom for all participants. In addition to attending the weekly guest lectures, students will also participate in three small-group sessions during the course of the semester."

Readings for the class will comprise selected academic papers, case studies and sections from books."
MGA 63300,"This course offers a comparative perspective on law and legal institutions. Looking comparatively helps shed light on other legal systems and helps us to question what is normal or natural.  The course seeks to disaggregate the legal traditions of populous countries in Asia while also looking for commonalities.  From what it means to be a lawyer to notions of what is just or fair, courts and dispute resolution in Asia can be both very different and, at times, surprisingly similar. After an overview of concepts and classic approaches to the study of law and society, the course will explore these differences and similarities in three Asian settings: China, Japan, and India. Topics include courts and the legal profession, crime, inequality, and environmental protection, to see how each country's history, political structure, values, and interests shape how legal issues are defined and play out.  In particular, we will examine the intersection of law and politics, the role that non-state actors and international norms and institutions have played in impacting outcomes and relevant policy implications."

The course will cover the foundations of Islamic belief, worship, and institutions, along with the evolution of sacred law (al-shari`a) and theology, as well as various aspects of intellectual activities. The Koran and the life of the Prophet Muhammad will be examined in detail. Both Sunni and Shi`i perspectives will be considered. Major Sufi personalities will be discussed to illuminate the mystical, and popular, tradition in Islam. Topics on arts, architecture, literary culture, and sciences will be covered. Although the course is concerned more with the history of ideas than with modern Islam as such, it has great relevance for understanding contemporary Muslim attitudes and political, social, and cultural trends in the Muslim world today.  "
MI 20408,"The course provides an overview of the variety of the Eastern rite Churches belonging to different cultural traditions of Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean world. The students will be introduced to the theological views and liturgical life of the Eastern rite Christians, i.e., Orthodox, Oriental and Eastern Catholic, and their fascinating history. In the second part of the course we shall explore the Byzantine rite Churches in more detail, and discuss the challenges their theology and history present to the Christian world at large. Special attention will be given to Slavic Christianity and especially Russian and Ukrainian religious history. Reflection on the diversity of Christian traditions will lead to important insights into theological topics of central importance for today such as theology of culture, ecclesiology, sacramental theology and theology of history."
MI 20473,"While many Christians have described Islam as a Christian heresy, many Muslims consider Christianity to be an Islamic heresy. Jesus, they maintain, was a Muslim prophet. Like Adam and Abraham before him, like Muhammad after him, he was sent to preach Islam. In this view Islam is the natural religion--eternal, universal, and unchanging. Other religions, including Christianity, arose only when people went astray. Therefore Muslims have long challenged the legitimacy of Christian doctrines that differ from Islam, including the Trinity, the incarnation, the cross, and the new covenant and the church. In this course we will examine Islamic writings, from the Qur'an to contemporary texts, in which these doctrines are challenged. We will then examine the history of Christian responses to these challenges and consider, as theologians, how Christians might approach them today. Regarding the Islamic Challenge to Christian Theology is the second of two required theology courses at Notre Dame (the development course). These two courses are directed towards a number of goals. First, they provide students with information about the Bible and Christian theology that in itself is important. Second, they form the basis of a Catholic community at Notre Dame where all students (whether or not they are practicing Catholics) have a common experience of texts and questions that might be discussed not only in class but while eating mashed potatoes in North Dining Hall. Third, theology itself is meant as a guiding light for all other classes. As with the great European universities (Paris, Bologna, Oxford, Cambridge etc.), Notre Dame was founded by the church to be a community where students are strengthened in their faith and morals, and therefore more able to see the truth in other fields, whether biology, music, or history. Like the first required course (Foundations), Regarding the Islamic Challenge to Christian Theology has the same goals. This is not an Islamic Studies course. It is a course which takes Islam's challenge to Christian teaching as the starting point for Christian theological reflection."
MI 20503,"The histories of sainthood, war, and theology are strangely intertwined. Accounts of violent warfare in the Old Testament led the Manichaeans and the Marcionites to reject the Old Testament and its God and to deny the holiness of Jewish patriarchs (Abraham, Jacob, Moses), prophets, and kings (David). Defending the unity of the Bible as the inspired Word of God, Saint Augustine defended the holiness of Old Testament battle-leaders and laid the foundation for a 'Just War' theory. Many Christian saints (Martin of Tours, Christopher, Guthlac, Francis of Assisi) became hermits and ascetics after quitting military service, turning battle against the enemy into a discipline of struggle against the devil and his temptations. Some former soldiers (e.g., Saint Ignatius of Loyola) adopted military discipline, language, and images in their striving for holiness. Saint Bernard of Clairvaux taught that Christian knighthood and the Crusades could be paths to sainthood, even as he warned against the spiritual dangers of warfare. Saints Joan of Arc and Saint George were warrior saints and are invoked by soldiers. In modern times, reflection on warfare has inspired extraordinary writings by mystically gifted souls (e.g., Teilhard de Chardin's Mass on the Altar of the World, Simone Weil's Iliad, Poem of Force) who served in war zones. Other saints, martyrs, and mystics (Dorothy Day, Franz Jagerstaetter, Franz Reinisch) have, however, refused military service as idolatrous. The Church's social teaching constantly proclaims the call to peace and peacemaking, the possibility of conscientious objection, and the criteria for just and unjust war. This course seeks to understand the diversity of saintly decisions and practices and to discern their faithfulness to Christian doctrine."
MI 20670,"Ireland produced one of the most unique, extensive, and oldest literatures in Europe. In this class we look at a wide range of stories -- saints' lives, political poetry, myth and legend, heroic epic, lament, and placelore -- from ca. 800-1800 C.E. We learn about the changing religious, political, cultural and intellectual contexts to which these Irish women and men responded with their powerful compositions. We ask: what did Irish writers record about their conversion from paganism to Christianity? How did they use Gaelic poetry to protest invasion and English colonization? How did texts created by and about remarkable women like St. Brigit, the warrior-queen Medb, and the keening poet Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill, address issues of gender and power in a heavily patriarchal Ireland? In this class we think about the transformative potential of words, and ask the question: what is literature, and how do we recognize and appreciate it? What defines Irish literature, and what has made it so politically and culturally dynamic? By looking at authors ranging from saints and scholars to dispossessed poets and grieving women, we examine the voices from Ireland's past that still speak to us today.  "
MI 20705,"This course will survey the major objects, images, and monuments from Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Near East between circa 300 AD and circa 1400 AD. It will begin with the first examples of Christian art in the Early Christian period and end with the precursors of the Renaissance. The course will cover a fascinating variety of art historical, theological, and cultural topics relevant to medieval art: the origins of modern painting; politics and monumental art; pilgrimage, relics, and the cult of the Saints; manuscript making and the origins of the book; Iconoclasm; and the Crusades, among others. By the end of the course, students will gain concrete knowledge of the vibrant and varied artworks, figures, and concepts that have shaped the visual imagination of Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Near East. Students will further acquire visual literacy skills that will allow them to interpret images and read visual objects and texts together."

MI 20822,"Can the secrets of the past help us solve our problems in the future? This course uncovers the clues that our ancestors left behind in ruins, abandoned cities, pyramids, and on the earth itself. We will discuss key issues facing humanity today through the lens of the past. How prone are we as a species to degrading our environment? How flexible are we in the face of environmental change? Are humans basically violent, and are we destined to keep killing each other? These are some of the big questions that can be addressed using the archaeological record. The anthropological and archaeological study of past failure (and success) can help us understand the urgent challenges our our own age."
MI 30008,"Violence and bloodshed have long been central to the modern conception of the middle ages. In recent film and literature, the perceived realism of a given work tends, by and large, to correspond directly with the willingness of the creators to depict brutality. Even in the medievalism of popular fantasy, the depiction of violence in all its varied forms, from the battlefield to the bedchamber, has been justified and excused by claims of representing past realities of common experience. This course will question just how violent the middle ages were, and for whom. More importantly, it will seek to understand how the varied cultures and peoples of medieval Europe conceptualized and understood violence themselves, and what role it played in their lives and imaginations. In the course of our investigation, we will explore literary narratives of vengeance and crusade and farcical tales of household bloodshed. We will read law codes and sermons attempting to regulate and channel violence. We will read accounts, justifications, and repudiations of torture, execution, and mercy. We will read about peace-making and peace- breaking, and the stories that were told about it. We will question what constitutes violence, and how violence relates to shifting categories of gender, class, and group identity. In all of this, we will seek to identify the differences and similarities between their conceptions of violence and our own can teach us not only about them, but about ourselves."
MI 30195,"This is an introductory survey of English poetic and prose texts written from the eighth to the mid-seventeenth century. We will study these literary artifacts as imaginative representatives of experience, as cultural maps, and as human messages-in-a-bottle, set afloat in the seas of time. As we read these selections composed in English from past centuries past, we will be looking for both familiarity and strangeness. We will also be forming a sense of the variety and differing uses of literary genres: epic and romance [Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]; short story [Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and the Lais of Marie de France]; religious diary [excerpts from the mystical visions of Julian of Norwich in Revelations of Divine Love] and autobiography [from the first written in English, authored by Marjorie Kempe, a laywoman who records her business ventures, her negotiations of marital sex life, her adventures on pilgrimage, and her religious examination by the archbishop as a potential heretic]. We will also read lyric poems from the Old and Middle English periods, and from the Renaissance and seventeenth centuries, including some of Shakespeare's sonnets; political satire [excerpts from Utopia, a prose fiction authored by Sir/Saint Thomas More]; and at least on play - possibly two - from the Medieval and/or Renaissance performing tradition. The semester's literary pilgrimage will conclude by coming full circle, back to the epic revisited, with selections from Milton's Paradise Lost. Regular short quizzes. Midterm and final examinations. Two short (5-10 pp.) Essays, due at mid-term and end-term. Text: The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Vol. I, 7th edition."
MI 30243,"The aim of this class is to try to understand what conquest, as we have traditionally called it, meant to the people who experienced it in some parts of the Americas that joined the Spanish monarchy in the sixteenth century. We'll concentrate on indigenous sources - documentary, pictorial, and material - and try to adopt the indigenous point of view, without neglecting sources mediated by Europeans. Although the class will concentrate on selected cases from Mesoamerica, the lecturer will try to set the materials in the context of other encounters, both within the Americas and further afield; and students will be free, if they wish, to explore case-studies from anywhere they choose in the Americas (in consultation with the lecturer and subject to his approval) in their individual projects."
MI 30271,"This course is designed as a general introduction into the early and middle Byzantine period, focusing on the various aspects of transformation from the late Roman Empire to Byzantium at the end of the so-called ‘Dark Ages'. The main topics are the Christianization of the Empire and the separation between East and West; reactions to the barbarian migrations, the Slavic expansion, and the Islamic conquests; patterns of social and economic change; iconoclasm; Byzantine relations with the Carolingian and Ottonian Empires."
MI 30301,"This course will concentrate on major figures and persistent themes. A balance will be sought between scope and depth, the latter ensured by a close reading of selected texts."

MI 30659,"This course studies the major themes of Islamic theology. It starts from the early debates concerned with Muslim views of God, the nature of the Qur?an, the prophethood of Muhammad and ends with current debates about the status of Islamic law (shari?a). It also discusses divine vs. human will, the role of politics in Muslim view of salvation and the limits of rationality. It traces how these topics moved from simple formulae to complex concepts due to socio-political controversies and conditions, whether they were sectarian or interreligious conflicts, crises of legitimacy, colonialism or modernity. The arguments of various schools are presented, and translated excerpts from prominent theologians are studied. As we read these texts we ask ourselves a number of questions. For example, what alternatives were possible for theologians other than what later became standard Muslim doctrines? What is the importance of imagination in the creation of these theological systems? Did modern Muslim theologians have better options to handle ancient traditions that most of them ended up adopting? Do some modern Muslim theologians have an alternative view to offer? The course is meant to help students see the problems of theology from an Islamic viewpoint that may deepen their understanding of wider religious questions."
MI 30820,"This course provides an overview of the historical development of Japanese civilization and culture from the prehistoric era up through the 19th Century. Students will acquire a basic knowledge of Japanese geography, historical periods, changing class structure and political organization.

It introduces students to the various important linguistic, stylistic and literary influences that contributed to Christian Latin poetry and prose. Students will also be introduced to the varieties of Christian Latin texts and the bibliographical and research skills needed to pursue research into these texts. All along we will be concerned to improve our abilities to read and understand the Latin of the tradition that stretches from the first translations of scripture to the treatises of Jerome and Augustine. The survey of Medieval Latin language and literature in the spring semester follows and builds upon this course."
MI 40036,"Neoplatonic philosophy is one of the or maybe even the most influential intellectual movement in Late Antiquity, the Middle Ages and into modern times. Neoplatonic ideas shaped philosophical, theological, mystical and literary texts and art and architecture.   The course will study a wide range of Neoplatonic texts and of texts inspired by Neoplatonism from Antiquity into the Middle Ages, including the Byzantine, Latin and Arabic tradition.   As the intellecutal basis of the course, we will first study pagan Neoplatonism in late Antiquity. We will focus mainly on the founder of Neoplatonism Plotinus who transforms Platonic thought and combines it with Aristotelean ideas without neglecting Stoic input as well. Later developments in Neoplatonism will be dicussed as well, since they are the basis of Christian transformations of Neoplatonism (e.g. Porphyry, Proclus).  Then we will move to the first Christian transformations of Neoplatonic thought in late Antiquity, especially Dionysius the Areopagite, but also Boethius and Augustine.  After a briefer detour to Neoplatonism in Byzantium we will focus on the neoplatonic traditions in the Middle Ages, focusing especially on the first translations of Dionysius the Areopagite and his reception in philosophy, theology, mysticism and art. Furthermore, we will take a look at the Arabic tradition.  Topics dicussed in the course will include: 1) The Good, the One and God; 2) Intellect; 3) Soul; 4) Self, person, self-consciousness; 5) the intelligible realm and the visible world; 6) body; 7) matter 8) evil; 9) freedom; 10) the ascent of the soul and the union with the divine; 11) art and its anagocial power  Most texts will be read in translation, but we will also look at selected passages in Greek or Latin (for those who read these languages; they are not a requirement for the course).  The course is by design a graduate course, but could be opened to well-qualified undergraduates."
MI 40108,"This invention of the printing press was, according to Francis Bacon, a technology that changed and altered the whole face and state of things throughout the world. In this course, we will read and examine a selection of books that are considered to have had a major impact on the literary and political culture of the Anglophone world. In each case, we consider the book in question as a material object and as a literary text. Syllabus will include More, Utopia; Bacon, Essays; Shakespeare, Hamlet and The Tempest; Bunyan, Pilgrim's Progress; Defoe, Robinson Crusoe. "
MI 40196,"‘A person should be wise enough—but never too wise; life is most pleasant for those who know just enough'. Old Norse proverb, from Hávamál.  In this course, students will come to grips with Old Norse—a term that encompasses the medieval vernacular languages of Scandinavia and the vernacular literatures that flourished in Norway and Iceland between the Viking Age and the Reformation. The Old Norse literary corpus is remarkable for its breadth and variety, its literary quality and its cultural value: Norse manuscripts preserve our fullest record of pre-Christian mythology from northern Europe; traditional Germanic narrative and poetic traditions are uniquely well-represented in Old Norse versions, some of which date back to well before the Conversion; in the Icelandic sagas, one of Europe's most distinctive medieval genres, we see an unprecedented forerunner of ‘realistic' prose fiction. Knowledge of Old Norse also gives access to many primary sources relating to the perennially controversial and fascinating Vikings, who took their language as far afield as Russia, Rome, Reykjavik and Rouen. (And Old Norse was probably the first European language spoken in North America.)   Over the course of a semester, we will learn the fundamentals of Old Norse grammar, syntax and vocabulary. Although it has some quirks, Old Norse is not a particularly difficult language to pick up, and students will soon be able to read a saga in the original. We will introduce students to the history and literature of medieval Scandinavia, using translations at first but gradually bringing in original language material as our mastery of Old Norse increases.  This course will be assessed by means of regular grammar quizzes and translation exercises, and a final exam."
MI 40200,"We will begin with ancient precursors to medieval romance and then track the development of the genre through key Arabic, French, and English sources. All texts will be available in English. We'll start with Xenophon and the earliest Alexander romances, then move on to parts of the Thousand and One Nights, literature from the Layla and Majnun tradition, Marie de France, Chrétien de Troyes, Sir Orfeo, Floris and Blancheflour, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, among others."
MI 40411,"This course offers a survey of Christian theology from the end of the New Testament to the eve of the Reformation (well, almost). Taking the theological idea of Mystery as our theme, we will acquaint ourselves with theologians or theological developments of major significance in the period covered by the survey. Thus, students will be invited to think about the character and nature of the theological task while investigating major issues, challenges, and questions at the intersection of faith and reason."
MI 40500,"The goal of this course is to introduce upper-level undergraduates and master-level students to the methods and procedures, basic literary forms, and main authors of medieval academic (scholastic) theology, from its rise in the twelfth century to examples of Later Medieval and Early Modern periods. The overview will be provided against the backdrop of medieval intellectual history including the institutional development of medieval universities. We shall read and discuss selected chapters from works by Peter Abelard, Peter Lombard, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, William of Ockham, Francisco da Vitoria, and a few others, focusing on the texts that address questions of theological methodology, such as the notion of sacred doctrine (doctrina sacra), sacramental theology, and ecclesiology, particularly on the impact of scholastic discourse on the theological self-understanding of medieval Christianitas. Particular attention will be devoted to literary genres and forms (sententia, summa, distinctio, quaestio, etc.) as well as to the role that medieval canon law played in the development of scholasticism. We will also discuss the reception of Latin scholastic theology in the Greek East and the impact of Thomas Aquinas on Byzantine theological thought of the Later Medieval period. "

MI 60007,"This course will train students in the forensic approaches to the medieval manuscript book as a physical artifact. Students will learn to collect and interpret codicological data (e.g., collation, layout, decoration, distribution of scribal labor, book bindings, provenance, etc.). These skills will culminate in the ability to generate analytical manuscript descriptions and to integrate them into a larger research program. Specific treatment will be given to problematic genres of manuscripts such as Bibles, liturgical and music manuscripts, calendars, books of hours, legal texts, and fragments. In addition to the acquisition of codicological skills, students will learn to identify texts and develop a command of the secondary resources and bibliographic reference materials essential to the critical study of manuscripts. Students will work extensively with the medieval manuscripts in the collections of the Hesburgh Library and acquire plenty of hands-on experience. Pre-requisites: Students must be proficient in Latin; a previous course in Latin paleography is not required, but recommended. "
MI 60036,"Neoplatonic philosophy is one of the or maybe even the most influential intellectual movement in Late Antiquity, the Middle Ages and into modern times. Neoplatonic ideas shaped philosophical, theological, mystical and literary texts and art and architecture.   The course will study a wide range of Neoplatonic texts and of texts inspired by Neoplatonism from Antiquity into the Middle Ages, including the Byzantine, Latin and Arabic tradition.  As the intellecutal basis of the course, we will first study pagan Neoplatonism in late Antiquity. We will focus mainly on the founder of Neoplatonism Plotinus who transforms Platonic thought and combines it with Aristotelean ideas without neglecting Stoic input as well. Later developments in Neoplatonism will be dicussed as well, since they are the basis of Christian transformations of Neoplatonism (e.g. Porphyry, Proclus).  Then we will move to the first Christian transformations of Neoplatonic thought in late Antiquity, especially Dionysius the Areopagite, but also Boethius and Augustine.  After a briefer detour to Neoplatonism in Byzantium we will focus on the neoplatonic traditions in the Middle Ages, focusing especially on the first translations of Dionysius the Areopagite and his reception in philosophy, theology, mysticism and art. Furthermore, we will take a look at the Arabic tradition.  Topics dicussed in the course will include: 1) The Good, the One and God; 2) Intellect; 3) Soul; 4) Self, person, self-consciousness; 5) the intelligible realm and the visible world; 6) body; 7) matter 8) evil; 9) freedom; 10) the ascent of the soul and the union with the divine; 11) art and its anagocial power  Most texts will be read in translation, but we will also look at selected passages in Greek or Latin (for those who read these languages; they are not a requirement for the course)."
MI 60194,"This course will offer basic familiarity with the Semitic language of Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic. Participants will learn grammar and vocabulary for basic reading which will serve as a basis for further study of Syriac. Syriac is important for any who are interested in early translations of the Bible, monasticism, patristics, church history, liturgy, hagiography, homilies, Manichaeism, the transmission of Greek philosophy, and Semitic linguistics. No previous experience with Syriac (or another Semitic language) is assumed."
MI 60405,Survey of liturgical history and sources with regard to both Eastern and Western rites.

Requirements will include short papers and exams. (Fall)
MI 60414,"From its origins in the Judaism of first-century Palestine, early Christianity spread quickly into Aramaic-, Greek-, and Latin-speaking communities of the Roman Empire.  This course will introduce the institutions created by Christianity as it separated from Judaism, as well as its interaction with the cultures into which it spread around the Mediterranean basin and into Mesopotamia and the Caucasus.  From these interactions came an articulated church structure, with literary and liturgical cultures specific to particular territories, and a cluster of beliefs both shared with and differentiated from Graeco-Roman and eastern cultures. Along with the history of these cultures, the course will consider the book cultures of early Christianity and its catechists, who gave rise to a web of teachings modulated in controversy and ecumenical councils.  The resultant theology, particularly teachings about the divine nature of Jesus and the related doctrine of the triadic godhead, is an important philosophical legacy of early Christianity, and will be the focus of inquiry as the course progresses."
MI 60473,"The Church makes the Eucharist and the Eucharist makes the Church. The goal of this course is a comprehensive understanding of the nature and development of the Christian Eucharist. It provides perspective on the origins and historical development of the eucharistic liturgy across traditions, examines the structure and content of eucharistic liturgies (esp. the Roman Mass, but also other liturgical rites), the historical relationship between the Eucharist and the arts (esp. music and architecture) and undertakes a systematic reflection on various theological issues (e.g. real presence, transubstantiation, the role of the priest, excommunication, etc.). Illumined by historical and theological reflection, students will also engage in critically examining contemporary pastoral issues as well as current debates in the liturgy wars."
MI 60500,"The goal of this course is to introduce upper-level undergraduates and master-level students to the methods and procedures, basic literary forms, and main authors of medieval academic (scholastic) theology, from its rise in the twelfth century to examples of Later Medieval and Early Modern periods. The overview will be provided against the backdrop of medieval intellectual history including the institutional development of medieval universities. We shall read and discuss selected chapters from works by Peter Abelard, Peter Lombard, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, William of Ockham, Francisco da Vitoria, and a few others, focusing on the texts that address questions of theological methodology, such as the notion of sacred doctrine (doctrina sacra), sacramental theology, and ecclesiology, particularly on the impact of scholastic discourse on the theological self-understanding of medieval Christianitas. Particular attention will be devoted to literary genres and forms (sententia, summa, distinctio, quaestio, etc.) as well as to the role that medieval canon law played in the development of scholasticism. We will also discuss the reception of Latin scholastic theology in the Greek East and the impact of Thomas Aquinas on Byzantine theological thought of the Later Medieval period. "
MI 60577,"An introduction to the close reading and textual analysis of representative texts from the Duecento through the Renaissance, including Lentini, Guinizzelli, Cavalcanti, Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Poliziano, Machiavelli, and Ariosto.

Taught in Italian. Required for majors and supplementary majors in the Literature and Culture concentration; either this course or ROIT 30721 is required for majors in the Italian Studies Concentration."
MI 60659,"This course studies the major themes of Islamic theology. It starts from the early debates concerned with Muslim views of God, the nature of the Qur?an, the prophethood of Muhammad and ends with current debates about the status of Islamic law (shari?a). It also discusses divine vs. human will, the role of politics in Muslim view of salvation and the limits of rationality. It traces how these topics moved from simple formulae to complex concepts due to socio-political controversies and conditions, whether they were sectarian or interreligious conflicts, crises of legitimacy, colonialism or modernity. The arguments of various schools are presented, and translated excerpts from prominent theologians are studied. As we read these texts we ask ourselves a number of questions. For example, what alternatives were possible for theologians other than what later became standard Muslim doctrines? What is the importance of imagination in the creation of these theological systems? Did modern Muslim theologians have better options to handle ancient traditions that most of them ended up adopting? Do some modern Muslim theologians have an alternative view to offer? The course is meant to help students see the problems of theology from an Islamic viewpoint that may deepen their understanding of wider religious questions."
MI 60703,"This course will introduce students to Christian visual art from its evident beginnings (ca. 200), attend to its transformation under imperial patronage, and consider the aftermath of controversies regarding the veneration of icons during the eighth and ninth centuries. Working with both objects and texts, core themes include the continuity between Christian and pagan art of Late Antiquity, the influence of imperial ceremonies and style, the emergence of holy icons, the development of Passion iconography, and the divergent styles, motifs, and theological perspectives on the validity and role of images from the Byzantine East to the early Medieval West."

MI 63041,"Medieval religious professionals--Rabbis, Priests, and Imams--often found themselves engaging with the beliefs and texts of religious others, whether they were opponents within their own faith traditions or outside it.  Moreover, a vast literature of religious polemic and apologetic survives from this period in many languages. This course will explore a number of such works, as well as influential recent scholarship on apologetic and polemic.  Students will write a twenty to thirty page research essay."
MI 63471,"In 1851 the French scholar Ernest Rénan wrote: one can say without exaggeration that the problem of the origins of Islam has definitely now been completely resolved. In 2012, however, scholars are more divided than ever over the question of Islamic origins. Rénan's confidence stemmed from the appearance in his day of medieval Muslim biographies of Muḥammad, which in their detailed descriptions of the Muslim prophet seemed to offer reliable historical data. Yet they are also late sources. The earliest Islamic biographies date from approximately 150 years after the traditional death date of Muhammad (632).The only earlier sources that scholars have to work with are the Qurʾān --a text marked by Biblical allusions and religious exhortation, not historical narratives --and the early Greek, Syriac and Armenian literature (primarily Christian) which alludes to the rise of a new religious movement in the Near East, but not in the manner of later Islamic works. All three sources -the Qurʾān, early non-Muslim literature, and classical Islamic sources -present particular interpretive challenges. In this seminar we will address the question of Islamic origins by appreciating the particular types and functions of these sources. At the same time we will examine the debate over these sources in recent scholarship, with particular attention to the theories of those (esp. Wansbrough, Crone, and Luxenberg) who argue that the origins of Islam are more closely related to the development of Christianity in the Late Antique Near East than is traditionally assumed. In this regard the present seminar is not a foray into Religious Studies as much as a studied examination of a movement (Islam) that is closely connected to Christianity, and of a text (the Qurʾān) that itself claims to present the proper exegesis of Biblical narratives. Accordingly students are not assumed to have any special background in Islamic Studies or in Arabic. They will be asked, on the other hand, to apply their knowledge of the History of Christianity (and Judaism) and Biblical Studies to the study of Islamic origins .In Fall 2012 students in the seminar will have the opportunity to participate in the activities of an international Mellon Foundation project on the study of the Qurʾan hosted at Notre Dame."
MI 63487,"Francis of Assisi (1181–1226) was canonized in July 16, 1228, prior to the composition of Thomas of Celano’s first Life of the saint, the Vita Prima commissioned by Pope Gregory IX and subsequently approved by him in 1229 for publication. In the decades following Francis’s canonization, the story of the saint was told and retold by different hagiographers in diverse ways, involving writers and readers in an intense, devotional, theological, liturgical, and polemical enterprise that culminated in Bonaventure of Bagnoregio’s Legenda Maior (1266). Reflective of anti-mendicant arguments at the universities, of Dominican / Franciscan disagreements about evangelical perfection, of internal divisions among Franciscans about the demands of discipleship, of apocalyptic theologies, of changes in the canonization process, and of Scholastic approaches to biblical reading, Bonaventure’s Legenda Maior invites a multi-dimensional analysis."
MI 63582,"Francis Petrarch (1304-1374), the son of a Florentine exile, “begotten and born in exile,” famously described himself a “peregrinus ubique” (a stranger everywhere [Epystole 3.19.16]). Seeking to transcend the alienations of the journey of life and his exiled existential status, the poet restlessly pursued in his writings an unstable equilibrium between arrival and departure,shuttling back and forth between residences and literary works: between Avignon and Vaucluse,between the De viris and the Africa, between Naples and Parma, between the De vita solitaria and the De otio, between Milan and Venice, between the Bucolicum carmen and the Epystole, between Padua and Arquà, between the Canzoniere and the Triumphi.  The seminar will be offered in English and will focus on Petrarch’s vernacular poetry, both the Canzoniere (Songs and Sonnets) and the Triumphi (The Triumphs), upon which his worldwide literary reputation is based.  But before taking up the Canzoniere and the Triumphi, we will consider the life of Petrarch, his intellectual activities and his other works, including selections from his epistolary collections (Familiarum Rerum Libri [Letters on Familiar Matters] and Seniles [Letters of Old Age]) and other Latin works, especially the Secretum. In recognition of the recently commemorated 700 th anniversary of Dante’s death in 2021, Petrarch’s complex response to the imposing legacy of his predecessor will constitute an important strand of inquiry throughout the course.  Advanced undergraduate students are welcome.  English translations of Italian and Latin primary sources will be made available and utilized. Requirements: seminar presentations, and a final paper.

MI 90203,"This course will explore the wealth of literature associated with Scotland from about 1300 to 1603 and the unification of the Scottish and English crowns. During this time, Scots writers (or makars) drew widely on models from the Continent (especially Latinate traditions), England, and Scotland itself. They addressed political issues like Scottish independence, literary issues like the fashioning of native Scots traditions, social issues like the legal infrastructure of Scotland, cultural issues like the impact of Humanism, and whimsical issues like the wisdom of animals. Often bypassed because of its language and because it does not fit neatly into paradigms of English literary history, Middle Scots literature produced some of the greatest and least read masterpieces of medieval Britain, including John Barbour's Bruce, Robert Henryson's Moral Fables and Testament of Cresseid, William Dunbar's lyrics, Gavin Douglas's Palis of Honour and Eneados, Richard Holland's The Buik of the Howlat, and David Lindsay's Dreme. We will read many of these works for their intrinsic and historical significance, and also consider relations between Middle Scots literature and textual production, including the importance of large individual manuscripts (like the Bannatyne, Asloan, and Maitland manuscripts), the repurposing of Scots poems in southern Middle English works, and the impact of Edinburgh's nascent printing trade.

Extraction of information from unstructured data is increasingly important for companies and other organizations but is still a nascent practice area within them. Analytic techniques are increasingly important for understanding what can be learned from unstructured data sets and demand is strong for unstructured data analytical skills. This course introduces the student to the basic concepts of unstructured data and the basic analytic techniques used to extract useful information from this data. The emphasis will be on determining what data to collect, how to collect it, how to process it and finally creating analytics from the data to solve basic business problems. Sources of text data will include emails, tweets and various documents. The analytics techniques will focus on solving problems using word counts, document term matrices, and classification techniques. The learning outcomes from this class will provide students with the basic skills sought in the marketplace."
MSSA 60450,"There is no shortage of data in the world. While data is constantly swirling around us, actually acquiring it can prove difficult. To make actionable insights, we need a way to collect that data and prepare it for analysis. In this course, you will learn how to acquire data through several methods: application programming interfaces (APIs), web scraping, web-based surveys, and streaming. We will take an in-depth look at each of these technologies, so that you can apply them in any real analytics scenario. You will be able to use these various technologies to collect data and conduct analyses commonly seen for each type of method (from standard modeling techniques to factor analysis and beyond). This course will focus on using R, Python, and Qualtrics to collect and analyze data, in addition to exploring modern data streaming technologies. While Qualtrics will be used for survey creation and administration, the survey methodology skills will translate to any survey program."
MSSA 60510,"Machine learning is the science of getting technology systems to act without following prescriptive software. Most AI is unknowingly used daily by humans in their cars, homes, companies and experience it in the infrastructure of our nation. Most think we are in the midst of a new industrial revolution that is driven by AI software accompanied by sensors and big data that feed the software what it needs to act. This course will teach machine learning techniques and the application of those techniques. The course will cover supervised learning, unsupervised learning, best practices and AI safety or the ethics of AI. "
MSSA 60520,"Many industries are being created and transformed by using the techniques of business analytics. With the goal of studying these techniques in some depth, this course focuses on one such industry: sports. This industry has clearly benefited from the application of a wide variety of analytics techniques, and has the advantage of being widely and closely followed, with large amounts of easily-accessible real-world data. Topics for study in this course include how to evaluate players, rate teams, schedule leagues, and enhance coaching strategies. Assignments involve the hands-on use of a variety of techniques and tools, which are useful in most industries. Techniques and tools include data manipulation, probability, statistics, simulation, and visualization. "

MUS 10140,"This course offers an introduction to ethnomusicology. We will explore its development and research methods, focusing on the big questions asked by ethnomusicologists:  How might we define and refine our understanding of musical sound(s)? What are the shared and unique building blocks of expression in different kinds of musics? How do these musics differ across time and space, and what can musical practice teach us about any given society? Approaching these questions thematically and geographically, students will not only encounter numerous musical systems and cultures worldwide, but also be encouraged to rethink their own relationships with music. Coursework will include completing an ethnographic project as well as attending concerts and workshops with practitioners of various musical traditions (such as Indonesian gamelan, Afro-Cuban drumming, Middle Eastern maqam-based performance, Indian dance, etc.)."

MUS 40041,"MUS 40041 is a composition-oriented  study of counterpoint , especially as practiced in the 16th ?century?.  The first half of the course will be an advanced study of counterpoint in the style of Palestrina? and his contemporaries?.  Through model composition exercises, we will advance from simple species counterpoint toward complex imitative polyphony.  As we do so, we will study examples of polyphonic repertoire from this period.  After an intensive study of 16th century counterpoint, we will then extrapolate the principles of this constitutional idiom to a variety of other styles, including 18th Century instrumental writing (invention, fugue, etc.), and modern compositions.   16th century Counterpoint is integral to the evolution of classical music through to the present day; understanding this crucial component of music theory and composition is essential to the modern practicing musician."

PCAY 00602,"At no time since the end of the Cold War has our world looked more uncertain than today. World politics faces a series of global problems, some of which seem to mutually affect and exacerbate each other. This course surveys four of these inter-related challenges: climate change, terrorism, migration and refugee flows, and the global recession of democracy. It will do so by looking at scholarly debates around their origins, as well as the contemporary efforts to tackle these challenges."
PCAY 00605,"The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Convention is an international organization that recognizes exceptional natural places in the world, characterized by their outstanding biodiversity, ecosystems, geology and natural phenomena. The Convention has provided international recognition to around 3,500,000 km 2 in over 250 marine and terrestrial sites across more than 95 countries protecting a valuable sample of our natural heritage. As such, a consideration of natural places as heritage incorporates a diverse repertoire of marine ecosystems, biodiversity, forest conservation and climate change. The convention includes many heritage sites such as the Serengeti National Park (Tanzania), Galapagos Islands (Ecuador), Yellowstone National Park (U.S.A.) and the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) and are often a last refuge for species threatened with extinction, such as the mountain gorilla, giant panda and orangutan. Moreover, almost half of the 46 natural World Heritage sites where glaciers are currently found are threatened by rising temperatures and could see their glaciers disappear by 2100. These include several iconic landscapes such as Los Glaciares National Park in Argentina (containing some of the largest glaciers on Earth), Te Wahipounamu, South West New Zealand (which contains three quarters of New Zealand's glaciers), and Tanzania's Kilimanjaro National Park (home to Africa's highest peak). We will critically engage with these sites, while considering what they offer to us with regard to sustainable heritage practice and how this practice impacts the environment.The course will have a strong focus on group discussions with a mixture of lectures, presentations, documentaries and small group projects. Through classroom discussion and written work, you will develop the ability to articulate clear, well-supported, and persuasive arguments on the nature of heritage in its environmental context. By the end of the course you will be familiar with the world of UNESCO World Natural Heritage and the very important work it does with regard to the conservation of the environment."
PCAY 00607,"The State of Israel, as a case study, can be characterized along two axes: The vertical one is time, from ancient history to current times. The horizontal one is a microcosm of regional and global major issues: religion and state relations, liberal democracy versus conservative values, majority- minority relations, immigrant and indigenous populations, economic disparity, inequality, and the collapse of traditional state institutions.  In each weekly session, the students and the instructor will visit a new topic regarding the Israeli reality. Each topic will be handled through the vertical and horizontal accesses mentioned above. The instructor will guide the students to look into the deep historic roots of the issues, and will then deconstruct the topics both in their significance within the heterogeneous Israeli society and as part of a larger global phenomenon. The instructor will cover major issues and will not shy away from the more controversial and current topics such as Israeli politics and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The course aims on an interactive model despite its online nature. The instructor will share an overview and materials with the students. Students will usually be invited to a proactively share their views and discuss these in the group. These might include presumable theories of using science to solve political challenges, current newspaper articles on as well as videos and music recordings."

How are these performances created, what messages are being sent as we watch them and how do they affect us as we move through our daily lives?   In this course, students will be invited to deconstruct the performances they see on a variety of screens from their mobile phones to their local multiplexes. We will consider the content and context of a wide range of screen performances through different analytical lenses in order to discover meanings that we that we may not recognise at first glance. Students will respond to these performances through group discussions and brief individual critical essays.   The screen performances to be analysed will be based largely on student suggestions, but will include many from social media as well as the following: Hamilton (2020), Wakanda Forever (2022), Stranger Things (2016-Present) and Wednesday (2022)."

PHIL 10107,"This course is a survey of the philosophy of art. We will explore questions such as: What is the meaning of a work of art and what does it mean to say that a work of art represents some subject out there in the world? What is the value of painterly representation? Can music be said to be representational in this way, or should we rather think of it as expressive? What is the value of music? What is the relationship between the medium of a work of art (e.g. the marked canvas of a painting) and the subject of that painting? How is beauty (and aesthetic value) related to our ethical judgment and sensibilities? Over the duration of the course, students will become familiar with central themes in the philosophy of painting, the philosophy of literature, and the philosophy of music. Our philosophical reflection will be motivated by the study of examples: for instance, in painting, we will focus on the Italian Quattrocento and Cinquecento; in literature, on the novels of Jane Austen; and in music, on a selection of pieces from Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. In the last part of the class, we will discuss two big picture topics: (i) the extent to which technology transforms our aesthetic sensibilities (as when one performs Bach on a piano instead of a harpsichord); and (ii) whether the kind of aesthetic cognition we discussed in the case of art has an analog in the case of science.

PHIL 20210,"Simone Weil (1909-1943) was one of the most radical and uncompromising philosophers and persons of the 20th century. Her life was, from the very beginning to the very end, dedicated to the suffering of others (or “affliction,” as she came to call it), always in such a way that that dedication cost her personally as much as possible. Through it all, she was a philosopher, trying to make sense of her ethical and political commitments, her readings of ancient Greeks, and so on. This life and these thoughts led her to a surprising place – to the Catholic Church, or at least right up to the edge of it, since she never formally joined. Many of her last and most powerful pieces of writing – essays, letters, notebooks – deal with the relationship of humans to God, of what it means to be obedient to God.   In this course, we will read a wide range of her writings, along with excerpts from the great texts of Greek and Christian thought that influenced her most profoundly. Among the topics to be discussed: what does it mean to be oppressed? What makes work dignified, or not? Why does God allow us to suffer, and what obligations does the suffering of others place on us? Is membership in a particular church community necessary for a full relationship with God? All the while, we’ll also ask: who was Simone Weil, and how does the way she lived speak to the challenges we face now in the 21st century?"
PHIL 20211,"Art and literature in the last two centuries have raised with special intensity old questions about beauty, both its enchantments and its temptations. This course will consider these questions anew, drawing from two giants of modern Catholic thought, the French philosopher Jacques Maritain, an explicit follower of St. Thomas Aquinas, and the English novelist J.R.R. Tolkien, an implicit follower of St. John Henry Newman. Among the artists likely to be considered are Plato, Dante, Shakespeare, Richard Wagner, Friedrich Nietzsche, Thomas Mann, and Flannery O'Connor."
PHIL 20235,"Have you ever wondered about the meaning of it all? Though many philosophers, especially for a better part of the twentieth century were suspicious of the question, and despite the fact that it is often the subject of parody in pop culture, the question of life's meaning remains of deep and abiding human concern. In this course, we will tackle the question head on. To do so, we will explore a number of interconnected themes including intelligibility, purpose, significance, futility, naturalism, God, death, pessimism, and hope to name several. We will begin by considering thorny interpretive issues about how best to understand the question. In the heart of the course, we will compare theories of meaning grouped under the following broad categories: (1) Naturalistic Pessimism, (2) Theistic Optimism, and (3) Naturalistic Optimism. We will conclude by discussing a cluster of topics surrounding death, futility, and hope, weaving these themes back into earlier material.  Along the way we will discuss questions like: Does the question of life's meaning make sense? Are we cosmically significant? Does life have a purpose(s)? Is God necessary for a meaningful life? Is leading a meaningful life about fulfilling your strongest desires? Can you be wrong about what constitutes a meaningful life? Can an immoral life still be a meaningful life? How can I avoid a midlife crisis? How do circumstances, like being locked in solitary confinement for long periods, threaten meaningful life? Is death good news or bad news for life's meaning? Is an afterlife necessary for a meaningful life?  We will not limit ourselves to philosophy. Given that this is humanity's question, others from both within and outside of the Academy have as much to say. We will expand our exploration of the topic beyond the written medium to include film as we carefully listen to the diversity of voices speaking on life's grandest question."
PHIL 20401,"This ethics course is aimed at students with no background in ethics. We will survey three main moral frameworks (utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics) and their approaches to answering the kinds of ethical questions that you are likely to face in your life, e.g., How should I use money? What and how should I eat? Is abortion morally permissible? Is it ever good to be angry? Is life meaningful? We will read some of the best, philosophical answers to these questions while also reading fiction that engages with their ideas and trying out experiments in ethical living that give students a taste of the ethical approaches we are studying. Students will be asked to reflect on these experiences alongside the texts. (Students will be given choices in what experiments to try and will not be required to do anything that violates their conscience.) Although we will study a variety of ethical approaches, the most time and emphasis will be given to Christian virtue ethics. Texts will include the Abolition of Man by C.S. Lewis, Glittering Vices by Rebecca DeYoung, and many short, primary sources. In place of exams, students will be asked to write regular reflection assignments. Feel free to ask me for a syllabus."

PHIL 20628,"This course explores the ethical challenges posed by the ongoing revolution in the technology of war. After learning about some general, philosophical approaches to ethical decision making, we will examine a wide range of new weapons technologies, from smart bombs, drones, and robots to em (electromagnetic) weapons, cyberwar, and bio-enhancement, asking the question whether the existing framework of Just War Theory and the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) are adequate for war as it will be fought in the 21st century."

PHIL 20803,"This course will investigate the thought of arguably the two greatest medieval philosophers and Catholic philosophers--St. Thomas Aquinas and Bl. John Duns Scotus. They will be our guides for investigating questions concerning such topics as the possibility of change, the metaphysical structure of the world, whether natures are common (e.g., do all humans share one human nature?), the existence of God and His attributes, and the value of their thought today.  We will pay attention to their points of agreement and disagreement, evaluating their arguments and positions."
PHIL 20804,"The primary goal of the course is to introduce students to some of the central thinkers and historical controversies animating the French intellectual scene between the Reformation and the height of the enlightenment in the eighteenth century.

PHIL 22602,Discussion for PHIL 20602.
PHIL 24503,"The course focuses on how we ought to behave, or how it is rational for us to behave when we are not sure of the consequences of our actions. This is the subject matter of decision theory. The course will also look at what we ought to believe, or what is rational for us to believe, when in some sense we are not certain what to believe. So the course is all about the combination of normativity and uncertainty. This is a huge topic because uncertainty is everywhere. Thus as well as being interesting in its own right, the theories considered in the course have applications in nearly every area of philosophy. We will survey some major applications in ethics, philosophy of social science, and epistemology."

PHIL 43103,"The aim of the course is to render the students familiar with the most complex theories of the soul that were developed in antiquity and help them to study the validity and the soundness of the arguments developed in favor of them. While ancient philosophy did not yet grasp the radical difference between first-person and third-person approaches to the life of the mind, its attempts to understand the nature of the soul are very rich and at variance with each other. We will gain an overview of the theories of the soul by probably the three greatest ancient philosophers, Plato's, Aristotle's and Augustine's (while we will ignore the materialist conceptions of the Epicureans and the Stoics, Aristotle will teach us much about pre-Socratic notions). We will first read Plato's Phaedo, a dialogue in which Socrates, shortly before his execution, discusses arguments for and against the immortality of the soul. In this context, his theory of the Forms plays a crucial role. We will also have to discuss the difficult hermeneutic question of how Plato’s own opinions can be traced based on those of his dialogue’s interlocutors. For he himself does not appear in the Phaedo or in any of his dialogues.          We will spend most of the semester with Aristotle's treatise On the Soul and his so-called Parva naturalia, a collection of short essays dealing with mental phenomena such as sensation, memory, dreaming etc. An important difference between Plato and Aristotle is that the latter develops his philosophical psychology in accordance with his philosophical biology and thus connects the various types and activities of the soul with different organic functions. He furthermore uses basic concepts from his new metaphysics to elucidate the nature of the soul.  Finally, we will see how two short treatises by the young Augustine try to combine Platonic ideas with the new Christian beliefs. "
PHIL 43171,"A comprehensive consideration of the major themes in Kierkegaard's thought, including: the relation of art, ethics, and religion to life, knowledge and morality, the nature of subjectivity, what constitutes effective philosophical communication, etc. Main texts vary, but include the following (in whole or in part): Either/Or, Philosophical Fragments, The Concept of Anxiety, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Fear and Trembling, and Sickness unto Death."

PHIL 43301,"The most significant work in philosophical ethics in recent decades has been carried out as a project of retrieval from the large scale normative theories scattered throughout the history of philosophy.  In this course we will examine four of these historically significant bodies of ethical theory.  We will do close readings of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, Kant's Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, Mill's essays on Coleridge and on Bentham, and Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals.  These texts will be read in light of some of the contemporary disputes within ethical theory for which they provide a background.  Our primary goal, however, will be to understand the texts themselves.  The class will be run as a seminar.  Students will be expected to come to class prepared to discuss the reading for the day.  Course requirements will include three short papers (5-7 pages) and a take-home final.  There are no specific prerequisites for the course, but students will be expected to have the skills and the motivation to engage critically with challenging philosophical work."
PHIL 43303,"Art and literature in the last two centuries have raised with special intensity old questions about beauty, both its enchantments and its temptations. This course will consider these questions anew, drawing from two giants of modern Catholic thought, the French philosopher Jacques Maritain, an explicit follower of St. Thomas Aquinas, and the English novelist J.R.R. Tolkien, an implicit follower of St. John Henry Newman. Among the artists likely to be considered are Plato, Dante, Shakespeare, Richard Wagner, Friedrich Nietzsche, Thomas Mann, and Flannery O'Connor."
PHIL 43318,"This course will survey a variety of philosophical issues pertaining to gender and feminism.  Topics we expect to cover include the metaphysics of gender (e.g., the sex-gender distinction, the nature of masculinity and femininity, gender essentialism vs. gender constructivism); implicit bias and hermeneutic injustice; sexual harassment, violence, and the nature of consent; gender, feminism, and religion; and intersectionality."
PHIL 43335,"This course will deal with a range of core issues in contemporary meta-ethics.  Topics covered will include the question of whether our moral judgements truly describe some feature of our decisions, actions and character; the objectivity of moral judgements; whether our ordinary moral judgements might be radically mistaken; and what methods are appropriate for moral inquiry."
PHIL 43401,"The influence of John Rawls’s work on academic political and moral theorizing, especially on the academic disciplines of political and moral philosophy, would be difficult to overstate. The theoretical ambitions and the clear normative implications of his book A Theory of Justice showed the academy how much could still be accomplished in political philosophy. The book’s systematicity and clarity showed that these accomplishments could be won without loss of rigor. Its obvious connections to Kant and the social contract tradition did much to revive philosophers’ interest in the history of liberal thought. This seminar will begin with a careful study of parts of Rawls’s A Theory of Justice and of some of his later works. Rawls's theory has attracted criticism from a number of quarters. Some of the most interesting criticisms have come from the late Gerald Gaus and his students, who have argued for a quite different and anti-Rawlsian way of reasoning about fundamental political questions, and who have questioned Rawls's focus on what he called a well-ordered society. The latter part of the seminar will be spent reading and assessing some of their criticisms."

PHIL 43721,"Through much of its history, academia has been gendered in a particular way -male dominated, focused on men's interests, and privileging those interests -and much of it still is.  In response, the area of enquiry known as women's studies or gender studies emerged in the 1970s as part of the feminist movement.  In this course we will explore gender, the concept that lies at the heart of this area of enquiry.  We will find that this concept is as complex and multi-faceted as the diverse disciplines from which it now draws and as political as its feminist origins suggest.  We will also find that it is fraught with controversy.  Though the disciplines that contribute to the idea of gender comprise nearly all of academia, we will concentrate on the sciences, from which the concept of gender first emerged.  We will start with the gendered origins of the concept - the gender of science - and then proceed to the science that developed as a result - the science of gender; and we will conclude with some questions concerning the connection between the two - the gender of science and the science of gender.      No particular scientific background will be presupposed, and visits from science faculty will be organized to help us understand the terrain we will be covering.  The rest of the time the course will be run as a seminar.  Students will lead class discussions, present the results of individual research projects to the group, and have the opportunity to further develop those projects using feedback from the group.  Throughout, our aim will be for each student to develop a fully informed and defensible response to the controversial terrain we will be exploring."

PHIL 43903,"This course examines a range of metaphysical, ethical, and social questions about artificial intelligence. Questions to be addressed include: Could a computer be conscious? Is there anything the human mind can do that a machine couldn't be programmed to do? What are the similarities and differences between human and artificial intelligence? What are the likely cultural and economic effects of AI? What moral principles should guide our use of AI? Is it likely that we'll create AGI (artificial general intelligence), and would this pose an existential threat to humanity?"
PHIL 43907,"This course is an introduction to the metatheory of first-order logic, the central system of logic for both philosophical and mathematical purposes.

Students will also present their work."
PHIL 83226,"Many of the deepest ideas about God, the mind, the soul, the nature of embodiment, and beauty spring from the highly influential but understudied school of philosophy often referred to as Neoplatonism. Neoplatonists took themselves to be the philosophical heirs of Plato, but also sought to reconcile Plato's doctrines with Aristotle's as well as bring systematicity to Plato's famously unsystematic dialogues. Neoplatonists were system-builders interested in the connections among connecting metaphysics, ethics, epistemology, philosophical anthropology, and natural theology. The course will explore how neoplatonists approach these philosophical sub-disciplines are shaped in light of their foundational principles such as the priority of unity over multiplicity, the priority of intelligibile (mental) being over material being, the inherent link between beauty and desire, and that all caused things act as images or expressions of that which causes them.    Much of the Neoplatonic tradition was explicitly and proudly monotheistic, and partly for this reason, was highly influential in the intellectual development of Judiaism, Christianity, and Islam. In fact, Neoplatonic representatives can be found in each of the major monotheistic religions (and course readings will reflect the diversity of religious traditions in which neoplatonic thought flourished)."
PHIL 83269,"A central tenet of Kant’s philosophy of mind that is often underappreciated is that our mental powers are constituted by three faculties: the faculty of cognition, which generates beliefs, the faculty of desire, which generates volitions, and the faculty of feeling, which manifests the agreement (or lack thereof) ‘of an object or of an action with the subjective conditions of life’ (CPrR 144 [5:9fn]). Each faculty gives rise to different kinds of mental states with distinct functions in the general economy of the mind. This course will explore these functions and critically discuss Kant’s account of them in light of contemporary debates in the philosophy of mind."
PHIL 83610,"The influence of John Rawls’s work on academic political and moral theorizing, especially on the academic disciplines of political and moral philosophy, would be difficult to overstate.

PHIL 83801,"Science occupies a prominent place in our society. Science, it is said, secures knowledge that other endeavors cannot possibly obtain, and it can transform the world in radical ways. But what is the nature of scientific knowledge? What makes science so special? This survey course is an introduction to the philosophical debates about the nature of modern science. We will cover the central issues in the philosophy of science from logical empiricism to contemporary debates.

PHIL 93503,"Debates in metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language (as well as other areas of philosophy) often turn on questions about the existence and nature of properties, relations, and propositions. This seminar will engage contemporary work on, among others, the following questions: Should we believe in the existence of properties, relations, and propositions? If so, why? What are properties and relations, and how do they connect to the entities that have them? What are propositions, and how are they related to properties and relations? Do propositions represent in a way that properties and relations don't? What are the conditions under which properties, propositions, and relations are identical or distinct? "
PHIL 93604,"Some people think virtues necessarily conduce to flourishing. Some (other) people - especially but not exclusively religious people - think that lowly traits like humility, submission, forgiveness, meekness, and gentleness are important virtues. But taking up lowly positions, or counting oneself and one's interests as nothing, or submitting to or writing off others' aggression - these are not activities that seem generally conducive to (earthly) flourishing. Indeed, these activities can seem inappropriate; if those in contexts of oppression practice these virtues, won't this prolong and exacerbate conditions of injustice?   In this class, we'll ask whether the lowly virtues really are virtues, whether they are 'inclusive' virtues for people in contexts of oppression as well as contexts of privilege, how we ought best to conceive of the lowly virtues, and what the lowly virtues have to teach us about virtue theory in general. We'll read contemporary philosophical literature on (i) the lowly virtues, but also on (ii) the context-dependence of virtue and the golden mean, as well as (iii) eudaimonism about the virtues. "

PHYS 10033,"The Earth Focus course develops a narrative that pieces together the history of planet Earth over the last 4.5 billion years. Its violent beginnings, the changing orbital motions and seasons, the development of an atmosphere and oceans, all combined to produce a unique evolutionary history that formed a planet habitable by millions of life forms, including humans. The course introduces the science of natural climate change, including some drastic events that might leave you wondering how life could have survived. Understanding Earth's natural climate change is essential to analyzing and interpreting anthropogenic, i.e., human induced, climate change primarily brought about by the burning of fossil fuels over the last 150 years. The greenhouse effect will be used to explain how Earth has maintained its generally pleasant conditions, and climate models will be used to understand how small changes in CO2 levels can affect those conditions. With the ongoing consumption of fossil fuels, and the resulting addition of greenhouse gases into Earth's atmosphere, mankind is now conducting a unique experiment, one with potentially devastating consequences. Over the last century, the world has become highly industrialized and interconnected. The combustion of fossil fuels has played a major role in this process, and the consequences have become apparent with increasing pollution and climate issues. Earth is already beginning to react badly, e.g., a rise in ocean levels, weather extremes, ocean acidification, and extinction of species. How much the rising CO2 concentration and temperature will affect life on Earth is the question that scientists, politicians, economists, sociologists, as well as the rest of us, must consider in assessing what lies ahead. Decisions need to be made in the foreseeable future that will affect energy use, lifestyles, national economies, and international politics. Renewable and alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear are essential components of the energy discussion. A clear understanding of the science involved in the climate warming debate and potential solutions are necessary. It is up to each of us to examine the basic evidence and answer fundamental questions regarding what to do next. The goal of the course is to provide the history, science, and an understanding of the basic energy issues that face us in the 21st century with the goal of finding effective solutions. The focus will be on the facts and the underlying science, but it is also about the options and decisions that we, individually and as a society, must make regarding the very real implications of climate change."

PHYS 60061,"Communication skills are essential for sharing your research with others and ultimately securing a job.  Success as a scientist is inextricably tied to the ability to clearly describe complex ideas in writing, whether to communicate them to your colleagues through journal articles (or your thesis!), to your collaborators through internal working documents, or to funding evaluators in your fellowship and grant proposals.  In this course, we will discuss the key ingredients involved in writing clearly, concisely, efficiently, and effectively.  We will also address the effective visual presentation of information.  As a significant component of this class, you will plan, draft, and revise a substantial written work (such as a short paper) on your research. In doing so, you will make use of the writing principles we learn, and you will incorporate extensive feedback from the instructor and from your colleagues in the course. Thus, this course is intended primarily for graduate students in their second year and beyond, who are already engaged with research."

What fundamental assumptions about the natural world are adopted in much of modern science? What methods have scientists advocated for creating reliable knowledge? Students will grapple with these questions through laboratories and the discussion of central texts in the development of modern science, including works by Copernicus, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, and Einstein."
PLS 30501,"This course examines music as a case study for the non-verbal communication of meaning. We will ask what music means? How does it mean? Does it mean anything? We will engage these questions not simply on a philosophical level—reading core texts in the history of aesthetics—but also on a historical one: studying a diverse selection of musical works from across (and beyond) the Western canon. Rather than simply asking what music means, then, we will ask what it has meant, charting the changing conceptions of the medium's form, function, and significance. In the course of this music-historical journey, students will interrogate the relationship between artistic theory and practice; and they will draw comparisons with other art forms (painting, sculpture, literature, and so on). Last but not least, students will confront the central challenge of translating their own ephemeral, seemingly ineffable, musical experiences into clear, verifiable, and eloquent written prose.  Typical core aesthetic texts encountered in the class include: Kant's Critique of Judgment (1790), Schiller's On the Aesthetic Education of Man (1794), Schopenhauer's World as Will and Representation (c. 1844), Moreas's Symbolist Manifesto (1886), W. E. B. Dubois Criteria of Negro Art (1926), Adorno's On the Fetish Character in Music (1938), and Cage's Future of Music: Credo (1937).

POLS 10200,"This course provides an introduction to the study of international relations and will cover several theoretical approaches to and empirical issues in the field of IR.  Readings have been selected to highlight both traditional approaches to and more recent developments in world politics. The first half of the course focuses on contending theories of IR, while the second half of the course deals with more substantive issues.  Empirical topics and subjects covered include: international security (nuclear weapons, ethnic conflict, and terrorism); international political economy (trade, international finance, and globalization); and 20th Century History (WWI, WWII, and the Cold War).  In addition, we will examine several contemporary topics in international organization and law, including the environment, non-governmental organizations, and human rights.  We conclude by discussing the future of international relations in the 21st Century."
POLS 10400,"For anyone concerned about world politics today, this is an excellent, if painful, time to ask difficult questions about how we relate to each other and to the billions of other human beings beyond our respective national borders. In this course, I will encourage you to “think big” about politics, society, and international affairs. To this end, I will introduce you to a single theme that illuminates much of humanity's current plight:  the ongoing and necessarily conflictual evolution of a novel form of political belongingness known as the Modern Nation-State.  We will consider a variety of forms of political organization, such as feudalism, liberalism, Leninism, fascism, and anti-colonialism. This course is not focused on any particular country, although we will likely make forays into developments in places like Russia, Ukraine, China, Germany, Afghanistan, North Korea, and the US.  We will also consider a variety of topics, such as Protestantism, evolutionary theory, and endemic poverty.  Like politics, our course will evolve along with the shocks and surprises of a world in turmoil.

POLS 20200,"The study of International Relations (IR) is the study of human organization at its highest and most complex level.  The goal of IR scholarship is thus to try to manage this complexity intellectually by devising theories which help us to understand and predict state behavior.  The main purpose of this course, therefore, will be to introduce students to the most important IR theories.  These theories willl then, in turn, be applied to real-world IR events in order to test their utility in helping us to understand the world as it actually is.  By the end of the course, therefore, the student will have a grounding in both theoretical and factual aspects of IR analysis."
POLS 20400,"Comparative politics is the study of world politics. More technically, it is the subfield of political science that uses the comparative method to study the politics within nations. The focus on politics within nations distinguishes comparative politics from international relations, another subfield of political science concerned with studying politics across nations – e.g. diplomacy, war, trade, international organizations. This course introduces students to big questions in comparative politics that are also of fundamental relevance for the world today. We will examine theories and evidence concerning three themes: States and Political Regimes, Democracy (its emergence, quality and erosion), and Development. The course focuses on substance, but we will also evaluate the quality of the evidence and theoretical logic underpinning influential ideas in comparative politics. Though the course is organized around questions, the readings and lectures will often draw on the experience of individual countries.

POLS 30005,"This course is a comprehensive introduction to the workings of the contemporary U.S. Congress. We will examine who runs for and who wins seats in Congress, the lawmaking processes in the House and Senate, and the roles of parties and leaders in the two chambers. The purpose of this course is to examine two fundamental questions: (1) what do members of Congress do and why and (2) how do the individual and collective actions of members of Congress explain national policy? We will examine the process of legislating as well as the role of political parties, leaders, and interest groups. Throughout the semester, we will debate the common criticism that “Congress is broken” and consider its effectiveness as an institution. Is policymaking too partisan? Is the public’s disapproval of Congress justified?"
POLS 30010,"Political parties play many vital roles in American politics: They educate potential voters about political processes, policy issues, and civic duties. They mobilize citizens into political activity and involvement. They provide vital information about public debates. They control the choices--candidates and platforms that voters face at the ballot box. They influence and organize the activities of government officials. Most importantly, by providing a link between government and the governed, they are a central mechanism of representation. These roles--how well they are performed, what bias exists, how they shape outcomes, how they have changed over time--have consequences for the working of the American political system."
POLS 30040,"Public policy could be fairly described as applied social science. This course will introduce you to the fundamentals of public policy by (1) understanding how policy is crafted, (2) detailing the linkages between public opinion and public policy, (3) appreciating how political institutions may bound policy outcomes, (4) and exploring the ability of special interests, and other parties, to shape policy outcomes all while introducing you to various tools and frameworks for approaching the study of public policy. These tools will draw from an understanding of human behavior (psychology), markets (economics), governments (political science), and organizations (sociology) and introduce you to policy analysis. We will use a case study approach to delve into current public policy controversies including healthcare, higher education finance, and infrastructure. This course acts as the primary introductory course for the Hesburgh Minor in Public Service, but is designed for students of all majors and interests."
POLS 30048,"In the United States, public policy has the potential to be a consequential mechanism to address the most vexing and important social and economic problems: inequality, poverty, mass incarceration, climate change and much more. But policies do not appear out of thin air. They are the product of complex political processes. Even after policies are made, political decisions determine how they are implemented and to what end. In order to evaluate or change policy, we must understand politics. That is the focus of this course. We begin with a review of theoretical approaches to conceptualizing and studying public policy. We then explore key policy actors (the President, interest groups, denizens etc.), as well as core aspects of policy design and implementation. Finally, we closely study contemporary policy arenas. Along the way, students will be challenged to grapple with the paradoxes of policy making and to envision pathways to substantive change. Father Hesburgh famously credited President Lyndon Johnson's commitment to civil rights with changing the face of America. This class recognizes that dramatic policy change must consider the politics behind that change and politics seeking to maintain the status quo. This course fulfils the capstone requirement for the Hesburgh Program in Public Service."
POLS 30051,"This course introduces students to major actors, institutions, processes, and policies of substate governments in the United States.  Through an intensive comparative examination of historical and contemporary politics in city governments, we will gain an understanding of municipal government and its role within the larger contexts of state and national government. Among the issues we will examine are representation, race and ethnicity, neighborhood development, and governing the multicultural metropolis."
POLS 30068,"This course explores topics in American constitutional law related to civil liberties and civil rights. The course employs a variety of instructional methods including Socratic method lectures, class debates, and moot court exercises in which students play the role of lawyers and justices arguing a Supreme Court case. Students will explore the social and political struggles that have shaped freedom and equality in the United States, including debates over protest, hate speech, pornography, religious freedom, gun control, abortion, race, gender, and homosexuality."
POLS 30115,"This course explores how economic, social, and political inequality is reflected in various components of the U.S. governing system and how U.S. political institutions shape the distribution of power and economic well-being. We will examine the role of Congress, the presidency, courts, separation of powers, veto points, and federalism in reproducing economic and social inequality. We will also examine how economic and racial inequality is embedded in the design of U.S. political institutions. A core ongoing theme of the course is whether and how U.S. democracy can survive and thrive in the face of a variety of enduring inequalities. The course will include a combination of lectures and discussions. Assessment will be based on a series of short written assignments and/or quizzes as well as a substantial final paper with a collaborative and individual option."
POLS 30118,"This course will examine the causes, current state, and consequences of polarization in American politics. The course will consider various conceptualizations of polarization, including ideological polarization, affective polarization, and asymmetric polarization. Students will also compare polarization at various levels of politics, from the mass public to activists and party elites. Beyond partisan polarization, the course will also address partisan sorting and the ways in which Americans now appear politically polarized across various boundaries including religiosity, education status, and geography. Students will develop a broad understanding of polarization in American politics and grapple with what the future looks like for a polarized America."
POLS 30134,"Immigration is an issue of increasing importance in the United States. Few issues have generated as much debate and emotion as the immigration policy. The goal of this course is to provide students with an overview of the critical normative and academic questions in political science regarding immigration in the U.S. What factors have affected contemporary and historical immigration policy in the United States? In particular how have economics, demographics, politics, religion, culture, environmental concerns, and ethnic and nationalist interests impacted the nature of immigration politics and policy? How have groups leveraged political influence for desired immigration policy outcomes? We will study the impact of worldwide immigration and population trends on the formulation of American policy. The emphasis will be on an academic understanding of how immigration policy has been affected by domestic and international demographic and political factors."
POLS 30142,"This course will explore the roots of philanthropy in American society, the role philanthropy plays within the modern economy, and how philanthropic activity helps us create a better world and strive for the common good. The key component of the course requires students to act as a Board of Directors and use thoughtful analysis to award real grants to deserving nonprofits (a sum up to $50,000). Students are expected to come to each class prepared to discuss course readings, and to offer ideas and suggestions regarding the grant making process. Each student is also expected to complete two site visits to nonprofit organizations outside of normal class hours. Students will nominate nonprofits for awards and the class will systematically discuss, analyze, and ultimately vote to award the grants. "
POLS 30154,"This course focuses on selected legal and policy issues related to K-12 education in the United States. A central theme is the intersection of K-12 schooling and the state, with a particular focus on Constitutional issues of religious freedom and establishment, student speech and privacy, parental choice, educational opportunity, and education reform trends such as charter schools and accountability measures.  Questions examined over the course of the semester include:  What are the most basic obligations of the state with regard to its regulation of K-12 education?  What are the most basic rights of parents in this regard?  In what ways does the 1st Amendment protect - and limit - the speech and privacy rights of K-12 schoolchildren?  In what ways may the state accommodate K-12 schools with an explicitly religious character? What are the Constitutional requirements with regard to religious speech or expression within K-12 public schools?  To what degree is the principle of equality manifest in the form of educational opportunity?  How has this changed over time?  In what ways have education reform trends such as charter schooling and increased accountability changed the policy landscape of K-12 education?"
POLS 30173,"Almost all crimes, or even human interactions, contain a digital component. The fact that old laws don't always fit new problems is no more apparent than in the area of cybercrimes. This course will include discussion of topics including: the methodology of typical cyber investigations, the application of the Fourth Amendment to digital evidence, and different types of cyber-specific laws enforced today. The course will also focus on the responses of both courts and legislators to the ever-evolving issues presented by computer crimes."
POLS 30201,"The United States is the most powerful state in the world today. Its actions are important not just for US citizens, but they also affect whether others go to war, whether they will win their wars, whether they receive economic aid, whether they will go broke, or whether they will starve. What determines US foreign policy? What is the national interest? When do we go to war? Would you send US soldiers into war? If so, into which wars and for what reasons? How do our economic policies affect others? Does trade help or hurt the US economy and its citizens? We first study several theories about foreign policy. We then examine the US foreign policy process, including the President, Congress, the bureaucracy, the media, and public opinion. To see how this all works, we turn to the history of US foreign policy, from Washington's farewell address through the World Wars and the Cold War to the Gulf War. We then study several major issue areas, including weapons of mass destruction, trade and economics, and the environment. Finally, we develop and debate forecasts and strategies for the future."
POLS 30210,"This course serves as a gateway for subsequent coursework in international security. It is a required course in the Notre Dame International Security Center's undergraduate certificate program requirements, but it is also appropriate for, and open to, any Notre Dame students interested in U.S. national security policymaking.  It will begin with an account of the history and development of U.S. national security policy from the Founding through the present.  Next, it examines the current state of the primary institutions involved in U.S. national security policymaking.  Finally, it explores the tools and instruments of military statecraft as applied by the United States.  The course culminates with a simulation exercise in which students will role-play key participants in the U.S. national security policymaking process. At a minimum, that students will gain from it the analytical tools, historical knowledge, and current-events background to become more informed citizens, particularly with respect to important national debates about when and how our country should use military force.  At a maximum, the course may lead some students to become interested enough in the topic to pursue a career in either the practice or the study of U.S. national security policy.

POLS 30242,"This course examines how oil and natural gas have shaped international relations from the early twentieth century to the present, with a particular focus on conflict.  It begins by introducing students to the fundamentals of global energy production, consumption and trade, and then briefly surveys the political history of oil as it relates to the great powers.  The course then moves on to contemporary issues, including the political significance of fracking technology, the role of the United States in protecting Persian Gulf oil, and the extent to which Russia's dominant natural gas position might translate into political influence in Europe.  These and other topics are examined through numerous theoretical lenses, including theories of resource conflict, economic interdependence, political coercion, and petro-aggression."

POLS 30363,"An introduction to the field of international development, with particular focus on the various disciplines that have contributed to and shaped the development discourse. Readings, lectures, and discussions will draw from various disciplines, including economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, environmental and technological sciences, public health, law, and gender studies, among others. We will examine debates on the meaning and measurement of development; alternative approaches to, and methods in, the study of development; and attempts to address some of the main development challenges facing the world today. There will be a central focus on understanding what works in development. Working together in teams, students will conceptualize and design an international development project using real world constraints."
POLS 30364,"Market-oriented reforms known as ‘neoliberalism’ have dominated the reform agenda across the world. These reforms were passed amidst tremendous political contestations and have delivered varying degrees of success. For the developing countries that faced the additional/simultaneous challenges of building ‘good’ institutions and governance systems, these reforms have resulted in questionable outcomes. Given this, today’s emerging economies have been forced to re-assess the benefits of market-oriented reforms, and those with policy space and political will/capacity have embarked on new reform experiments. The module introduces the students to the complexities and challenges of economic reforms in the fast-growing economies by placing politics at the heart of the analysis. The course is comprised of two parts. The first part provides the theoretical and conceptual foundations for examining the processes and outcomes of economic reforms. It discusses the limitations and dangers of designing and implementing reforms without consideration of the broader concept of states and markets or sufficient engagement with politics. This is because policy always produces new winners and losers, and as a result provokes resistance from those who believe they will lose wealth, status, or power. The second part investigates reforms in key areas of the political economy where there have been significant reforms and where distributive tension and conflicts are rampant. These include privatization, trade liberalization, industrial policies, debt and macroeconomic stabilization, tax and fiscal, and social policy reforms, food and nutrition, among others. Given the importance of national and regional contexts when discussing politics, the course draws cases from a wide range of geographical areas including East Asia, Latin American and Sub-Saharan Africa. The module concludes by examining the implications of factoring politics and local contexts into economic reforms for development policy and management and discusses whether new development paradigms and models exist for emerging economies."
POLS 30421,"In this course on European politics we will examine the literature on three major issues:  regional integration, origins of modern political authority, and industrial political economy.  We will seek to understand the origin, current functioning, and possible futures for key European institutions, including the EU, nation-states, social provision, unions, and political parties.  Readings on the European Union, monetary politics, Germany, France, and Spain will be drawn from both scholarly sources and contemporary analyses of political events."
POLS 30460,"This course will explore contemporary globalization trends across Africa and in the United States. It will focus on the ways that international forces and new technologies are affecting citizens and countries on the African continent as well as in the US. Over the course of the semester, we will share lectures, discussions, and group work with a sister class at the University of Pretoria in South Africa.  Through case studies and reviews of current events, the course will explore a diverse set of topics including technological change and development, the environment, migration, art and culture, trade, investment and aid, and contentious politics. The course will attempt to highlight the new opportunities for citizens as well as the challenges that remain for countries in the globalized world."
POLS 30470,"Scholars have long speculated about the rise of Asia, but Asia has already risen. Asian economies are driving global growth; Asian governments are some of the largest purveyors of foreign aid and investment; and Asian superpowers like China are shaping and shifting geopolitics. This course, taught by a political scientist and a historian, offers students the opportunity to unpack the complexity and diversity of Asia across time and space. We will explore Asia through political and historical concepts against the background of China's evolving role within the region. At the same time, we will focus on elevating diverse Asian voices to understand how historical concepts and political and economic trajectories have shifted over time and what it means for domestic and global audiences in the 21st century.  As an integration course, our focus is analytical and interdisciplinary: we examine the political, economic, and social trajectory of Asia to shed light on the most dynamic region of the world. We also devote considerable time to understanding how historical legacies and patterns such as colonialism or economic imperialism impact Asia today. Lectures, assigned readings covering a wide range of primary and secondary sources in political science and history, and a discussion-oriented format introduces students to issues ranging from populism, party-state capitalism, and poverty alleviation to soft and sharp power, demographic crises, surveillance, and social unrest. All majors and backgrounds are welcome. No prior knowledge of Asian languages or topics is required."
POLS 30510,"What is the role of the police in a democracy? What are their powers? Who makes their rules and provides oversight? Do we even need them? How do citizens respond to the realities of being policed through political activism, day-to-day interactions, and music and literature? While the police are charged with maintaining one of the most fundamental functions of the state, the “monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force”, the answers to these questions vary dramatically around the world and throughout history. Partially driven by recent scandals involving police violence, activists, politicians, public security professionals, and social scientists have been carefully reconsidering their views on policing, recognizing the police as powerful political actors and policing policies as dynamic policy arenas. In this course, we will explore the history of crime fighting and police forces in the modern era, then dive into current debates and research about the organization, mission, and oversight of police forces in contemporary democracies, including social movements advocating for police reform. This course has a global perspective, gaining understanding of local experiences in the United States through comparative study of primarily Latin American, British, and Western European systems."
POLS 30540,"The claim that Russians and Ukrainians are one people, “a single whole,” has been resounding in Russian mass media, film, and other discourses for the last two decades. Putin took a pronounced colonial turn with his return to the Presidency in 2012, describing Russia as a state-civilization, in which Russians and Ukrainians are joined in “spiritual unity.” History thus serves as a justification for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This course will look at historical facts and cultural artifacts of Russia and Ukraine to determine the roots of Russia’s current aggression in Ukraine. Among others, the course will discuss the following questions. Is Kyivan Rus part of Russian or Ukrainian history, or neither? Does Ukraine have its own history and culture that is distinct from Russian? Are Ukrainians divided into Russian-speakers (aspiring to join Russia) and Ukrainian-speaking nationalists (aspiring to EU)? The course will examine the origins, points of intersection and divergence of Ukrainian and Russian cultures through the lens of history, art, and literature from the Christianization of Rus (10th century) to the present time. We will look at the history of Russian imperialism, centuries of appropriation of Ukrainian cultural achievements, annihilation of Ukrainian traditions, extermination of Ukrainian intellectuals, and the politics of Russification with the purpose to see how the current events reflect a tendency that has already existed for centuries."
POLS 30553,"This course examines the late 20th and early 21st century 'economic miracles' of several East Asian countries and the political, social, and spatial factors underpinning them. We will explore similarities, differences, and interdependencies in the development trajectories of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and mainland China, and will debate how accurate and useful concepts like the developmental state and state capitalism are in describing the political economy of the region. To what extent has China's economic rise followed the existing playbooks of its East Asian neighbors? What human costs and developmental distortions have accompanied booming industrial and urban growth? And what lessons does East Asia's experience offer for the contemporary developing world?"
POLS 30562,"From the right to vote to the right to decide, the fight for women's rights has transformed public and private life across the world. This fight, however, has not necessarily been unified, nor has it been without obstacles. In this course, we will explore how movements for women's rights have changed through recent history, and how has it impacted politics around the world. This course will introduce general theories for social movements and collective action while analyzing the most relevant moments of social movements for women's rights in history. Students will be invited to reflect on how traditional theories of social movements lack a gender-perspective, how some of the most important social movements have ignored women as rights subjects. This course looks at the experiences of women's social movements from a comparative perspective. We will delve into analysis of cases from North and Latin America, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East."
POLS 30595,"This class aspires to develop relevant knowledge and practical skills for students interested in engaging in positive change in a complex world. In this course on international development, students will: 1) examine the processes that bring about individual and societal change in an international context;2) explore the roles, complexities, opportunities and constraints of development projects in areas such as poverty reduction, social development, health and education; and, 3) develop practical skills related to project design, planning, management, negotiations, communications, and the evaluation of international development projects.  A central theme of the course is to understand what have we learned over the past decades from systematic research and from experience in the field about what works. The course makes use of cases studies and draws lessons from instructive stories of failure as well as inspirational stories of change. The course focuses significant attention on bright spots in development- specific interventions that have made meaningful contributions. The course aspires to help train students to think like creative, effective, and thoughtful development professionals.  A central feature of the course will be the opportunity to work throughout the semester as a member of a Development Advisory Team directly with an international development organization client who has identified a specific problem or opportunity. Development clients for the class are organizations in Bangladesh, Chile, Haiti, and India, among others."
POLS 30654,"Catholicism and Politics poses the question, both simple and complex: How ought Catholics to think about the political order and political issues within it?  The first part of the course will survey major responses to this question drawn from Church history: the early church, the medieval church, and the modern church.  The second part applies these models to contemporary issues ranging among war, intervention, globalization, abortion, the death penalty, religious freedom, gender issues, and economic development.  The course culminates in Vatican III, where teams of students, representing church factions, gather to discover church teachings on selected controversial political issues."
POLS 30662,"Class examines philosophical, constitutional, and political questions pertaining to religion and politics, including: Do individuals have a right to religious liberty? If so, how might that right be protected? How does the American Constitution protect the right to religious freedom? What is the proper relationship between church and state? Is religion necessary, good, or bad for liberal democracy? Readings include selections from classical, medieval, and modern political philosophy, leading cases of American constitutional law, and contemporary legal theorist and political scientists."

The sequence is designed for students looking for and willing to engage in deep, deliberate, and careful study of core texts of Western constitutionalism. No application required."
POLS 30775,"The Arab Spring represented a moment of challenge to intransigent repressive structures and aspiration to new democratic constitutional orders. To understand this moment we need to appreciate the complex history of the region. This is a survey course that approaches the intellectual history of Islam from a very specific angle: its encounter with Western political and intellectual thought. We will be looking at the first encounter with Greek political philosophy during the formative period of Arab-Islamic thought, in addition to Early and Late Modern responses to the European military and cultural challenge. The historical/comparative structure of the course makes salient the continuities and discontinuities in the thematic treatment of subjects like reform, representation, forms of government, the role of the community, and the rule of law. Some of the case studies that we will consider include Ottoman administrative and constitutional reforms, Arab nationalism, Lebanese consociationalism, and the Iranian Revolution and its constitutional project."

POLS 40064,"Was the American Constitution originally a pro-slavery constitution that changed over time to a constitution that outlawed slavery and state-supported racial discrimination? Did the Civil War and subsequent developments through the civil rights acts of the 1960's represent a commitment implicit in constitutional principles from the nation's beginning? Do these constitutional principles embrace active governmental efforts to achieve an equal-opportunity society, including equal educational opportunity and an end to racism, a private attitude? Do constitutional principles promise a color-blind society? Or do they promise no more than color-blind governments? This course addresses these questions. Readings will include state documents like the Declaration of Independence and The Federalist Papers, the speeches of American politicians and other public figures, and decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court regarding slavery, public accommodations, education, voting, housing, and employment. Grades will be based on mid-term and final exams. Texts TBA."
POLS 40491,"Studying environmental politics can be a gloomy pursuit.  There are a myriad of devastating problems and a seeming scarcity of scientific and technological fixes.  Technical fixes aside, there is the even more problematic scarcity of political fixes.  Political institutions often seem to obstruct rather than facilitate environmentally sound policies, and the mass public and political leaders often prioritize competing goals and policies.  This course is designed to understand whether the pessimism is warranted and to search for the optimism: What are the best opportunities, scientific and political, for saving the planet?  What can realistically be accomplished?"
POLS 40801,This fall course is for seniors who are currently writing a senior thesis. The course will guide students through the first semester of the thesis-writing process from fine-tuning the research question and methodology to compiling a literature review and organizing the thesis.

Although the course introduces students to a variety of methodologies and the logic of research it is not intended to teach particular statistical techniques.
POLS 40811,"This course is designed to achieve three objectives: (1) introduce you to research and quantitative analysis in political science, (2) help you become critical consumers of political information and policy-oriented reporting, and (3) give you the ability to answer questions of social scientific importance using data. Throughout the course, we'll discuss the complexities of generating good research designs, starting with how to ask interesting questions and how to measure concepts of interest to social scientists. Students in this course will learn to understand the most common statistical techniques used in political science and acquire the skills necessary to use these techniques and interpret their results.  A mastery of these techniques is essential for understanding research on public opinion and voting behavior, electoral studies, and comparative research on the causes of democracy. The target audience for this course is undergraduate students with interest in the social sciences (not only Political Science), who want to use quantitative approaches to solve important problems, as well as develop marketable analytical skills."
POLS 40812,"Qualitative Political Analysis introduces the core qualitative methods used in political science. Students will learn about applying the scientific method in qualitative research; the links between theory and evidence; research design appropriate to research questions, including comparing the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative and quantitative research methods; the difference between systematic, evidence-based research and anecdotal work; and important techniques for analysis, inference, and interpretation, including case studies research.  This course can help prepare students to write a thesis in political science, but students do not need to plan to write a thesis for the course to be useful in their other studies and in their post-graduate careers.  This course also serves as one of the core classes in the political science department's methods specialization, but students who are not pursuing the specialization are also most welcome and will find the course useful.  The main goal of the course is to help students build their analytical skills -- to learn how political scientists think but also simply to learn to think better."

POLS 60043,"This is the core course on American political behavior-a central focus of empirical political science for nearly 70 years.  We will begin by considering normative questions about the role that ordinary citizens should play and realistically can be expected to play in a democratic polity. We then will turn to American public opinion, examining the sophistication of citizen opinion, the factors structuring opinion change, the social-group bases of U.S. public opinion, and the influence of public opinion on public policy.  We will devote the second half of the course to American voting behavior.  We will discuss the major theoretical models of vote choice; the factors shaping voter turnout; the role of parties, groups, and candidates in shaping voting behavior; long-term change in the parties' electoral coalitions, and the impact of political campaigns on electoral choice.  We will conclude the course by discussing the growth of party polarization in the American electorate and the causes and consequences of that growth.   The goal for the course is not only to immerse students in the vast literature on American political behavior, but also to provide the foundation for original research. To that end, we will spend a fair amount of time discussing research methods and approaches.  Students also will be expected to offer critiques of the ideas and methodologies presented in the literature, with an eye toward improving and finding new directions in research on political behavior. Finally, each student will do original research using data from one or more surveys of the American electorate."
POLS 60108,"This seminar offers an introduction to Islamic law, Islamic international law, and Islamic constitutionalism. Lectures and readings focus on sources and functioning of classical Islamic law as well as on the characteristics of modern Islamic constitutional and subconstitutional legal systems across Muslim-majority states. Students will consider the meaning of Islamic justice, its embodiment in the legal system, its execution, the way it has evolved, and the principles that underpin it. We will examine the role of Islamic jurisprudence in the shaping of law, and how a faith-based concept of law relates to modern domestic governance and modern international law."

POLS 60448,"Whether one is interested in comparative politics, international relations, American politics or political theory, the state is at the center of political analysis. The state sits at the intersection of domestic and international politics. State autonomy and state capacity fundamentally shape both society-society relations and inter-state competition. Are theories of the state Eurocentric and therefore inapplicable to non-European contexts, especially in the developing world? How are states built, why do states fail, and how can failed states be rebuilt? How does state capacity affect democratization? How do states promote economic development? In this seminar, we first read broad theoretical works and then examine country and regional cases: Europe, the U.S., Latin America, Russia, Eastern Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa."
POLS 60677,"This graduate seminar focuses on the work of the Frankfurt School, a highly influential group of twentieth century intellectuals who sought to investigate the unique challenges posed by capitalism, totalitarianism, modern bureaucracy, and mass politics. Influenced by Hegel, Marx, Weber, Nietzsche and Freud, they drew from a wide array of disciplines and theoretical approaches in an effort to diagnose the pathologies of modernity. Their studies, known as Critical Theory, were among the first that can be properly labeled interdisciplinary, encompassing insights from philosophy, aesthetics, political science, psychology, sociology and economics, among other fields. We will read the works of Georg Luka´cs, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse and Ju¨rgen Habermas, as well as more recent critical theorists. The seminar will consider the strengths and limitations of Critical Theory through close readings of the school's key texts. Some familiarity with ‘modern' social theory, particularly Kant, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche and Weber, is useful but not necessary."
POLS 60691,"In this graduate course in political theory and literature, we will discuss the classics of Enlightenment-era political thought from Hobbes to Wollstonecraft that evolved in relation to English and French fantasy, gothic-romantic, science fictional, and adventure-exploration verse epic and novels from the 1648 Peace of Westphalia to the immediate aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars and the 1815 Congress of Vienna. To trace the transmogrification of the concept and trope of the monster in modern European political thought on sovereignty, freedom, rights, revolution, legitimate constitutional government, gender, sexuality, family, race, rank, education, war, peace, conquest, slavery, colonialism, empire, and international relations, we will read Hobbes's Leviathan (1651); selections from Milton's verse epic Paradise Lost (1667); Locke's Second Treatise of Government (1689-90); Defoe's novel Robinson Crusoe (1719); Rousseau's First Discourse (1750), Second Discourse (1755), and his novel Emile, or On Education (1762); Kant's What is Enlightenment? (1784) and Speculative Beginning of Human History (1786); Madison's Federalist No. 51 (1788); Kant's Theory and Practice (1793)  and Perpetual Peace (1795); selections from Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790); Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790), selections from her A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), and her novel Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman (1798); and Shelley's novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus (1818). We will also cover the related scholarly debates in political theory, intellectual history, feminist theory, and literature on these topics. "
POLS 60700,"This course examines the two major texts of Aristotle’s political philosophy, his Nicomachean Ethics and Politics. Our aim will be to examine key parts of these works to understand their relation to one another and to grasp as fully as possible the character and substance of Aristotle’s political philosophy. If, to paraphrase Whitehead’s famous remark, Western philosophy is but a series of footnotes on Plato, Aristotle is clearly a major architect of the classical tradition and a central object of attack by modern thinkers who sought to dismantle it. By studying Aristotle’s Ethics and Politics, then, we will have a rich context not only for understanding the classical tradition but also for considering the modern effort to replace it and current efforts to recover it."
POLS 60830,"Qualitative Political Analysis introduces the core qualitative methods used in political science. Students will learn about applying the scientific method in qualitative research; the links between theory and evidence; research design appropriate to research questions, including comparing the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative and quantitative research methods; the difference between systematic, evidence-based research and anecdotal work; and important techniques for analysis, inference, and interpretation, including case study research. The course requires a set of homework assignments to practice the techniques of qualitative analysis and also a final paper that develops a research design suitable to answer an important political science question — a paper that likely can contribute substantially to the development of a dissertation prospectus."
POLS 60833,"This the first course in the quantitative methods sequence for Ph.D. students in Political Science. The course has three components. We start with a hands-on introduction to quantitative data analysis using the R computing and programming environment. We will cover measurement, causality and regression, and learn how to describe and plot politically relevant statistics. The second part of the course takes a step back to build up some mathematical foundation. We will cover calculus, optimization, and linear algebra. The third and last part of the course focuses on probability theory and statistical inference. We will cover distributions, large sample theorems, hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals."
POLS 60885,"This course is an introduction to causal inference methods used in quantitative social science research. It begins with theoretical and conceptual discussions of causality, then moves to the statistical theory underlying the potential outcomes model. It then covers a variety of methods designed to assist with identification of causal effects in both experimental and observational data. The course focuses on the two complementary goals of learning the theory behind causal inference as well as practical implementation in statistical software. Students will walk away from the course with an understanding of how to apply causal inference methods and what is going on under the hood with their results. Class time is spent in lecture and working hands-on with example data."

POLS 63800,"This is a required course for all first-year graduate students in the Department of Political Science. It is what is commonly called a scope and methods course; that is, a course designed to survey the great variety of themes and approaches in political science and to guide you through the fundamental debates about what political science is or should be. This course is also about democracy because the best way to teach about methods is to apply them to an interesting topic, and democracy is a topic of central interest to almost all of us these days. There is abundant literature that demonstrates the relevance of our course themes to democracy. Therefore, in the process of learning about the scope and methods of political science, this course will also familiarize you with some key ideas about what democracy is, what it could be, how it is changing, what causes it, and how we measure it."

These issues are examined in each of the four main parts of the course. In the first part, we examine attentiveness as a distinctive intellectual and spiritual problem for our time. In the second part, the focus will be on social scientific theories of work and how these relate to recent studies about subjectivity and the valuation of work in digital spaces (especially workplaces). In the third part of the course, the focus will shift to the construction/disciplining of subjectivity in Christian liturgical and monastic practices, focusing especially on the interplay of communal prayer and manual labor that has traditionally been part of Christian monastic discipline. In the fourth part, we conclude with a consideration of the work of creating and reading art (especially poetry and painting) in light of the social changes to work and the theological interpretations of work studied in the preceding parts of the course.

This course will introduce you to the fundamentals of public policy by (1) understanding how policy is crafted, (2) detailing the linkages between public opinion and public policy, (3) appreciating how political institutions may bound policy outcomes, (4) and exploring the ability of special interests, and other parties, to shape policy outcomes all while introducing you to various tools and frameworks for approaching the study of public policy. These tools will draw from an understanding of human behavior (psychology), markets (economics), governments (political science), and organizations (sociology) and introduce you to policy analysis. We will use a case study approach to delve into current public policy controversies including healthcare, higher education finance, and infrastructure. This course acts as the primary introductory course for the Hesburgh Minor in Public Service, but is designed for students of all majors and interests.  "
PS 23000,"In this gateway course, we ask: Why are people poor? We take an interdisciplinary look at poverty to better understand the forces that maintain poverty and the forces that resist it. From sustainability to social entrepreneurship, from economics to creative writing, we explore a variety of mindsets and methods for understanding, representing, and assessing poverty. Through academic and experiential learning, we gain a deeper understanding of the public and private programs and institutions that address poverty on the local, national, and global level. We also gain a deeper understanding of what has worked and what hasn't in domestic and international efforts to reduce poverty. Finally, students consider how they are called to address poverty in their personal and professional lives, exploring individual actions and careers that align with their skills and interests related to poverty."

PS 30555,"Do you want to learn how to solve problems that matter? Human Centered Design (HCD) is an empathetic tool that utilizes guided questioning related to product, service, or systems innovations to identify opportunities for sustainable, human-centered impact. For example, how might we design a cookstove that reduces the amount of smoke inhaled by a community member? How might we design a new service engaging low-income borrowers in rural communities? How might we design a system linking social innovators and their innovations to users across the globe in a manner that encourages collaboration and sharing of resources? Whether a social innovator is designing in the private, public or nonprofit sector, HCD provides a valuable framework, deeply rooted in empathy, and is an excellent methodology for social innovators who want to problem solve and design alongside communities. In this course students will be introduced to the HCD toolkit and will apply it in practice, either in a domestic or international context. This fast-paced course will take students through the HCD cycles of inspiration, ideation and implementation, and provide opportunities for student and community collaboration."

PS 40420,"n a world ever more connected, and inhabited by an increasing human population, the number of infectious disease outbreaks is rising. Understanding the epidemiology of viruses, bacteria, and parasites is crucial for the design of strategies to interrupt transmission. In the last two decades, molecular methods to study DNA, RNA, proteins, and antibodies have increasingly been used for such studies. Diagnosis by molecular tools increases the sensitivity over traditional methods such as microscopy. The genetic diversity of the pathogen and the host can be exploited to identify genes responsible for drug resistance, or to establish transmission networks. Antibody measurements allow the study of the human response to infection. This course will provide an overview of current laboratory methods to study infectious disease dynamics and discuss examples from the literature."

PSY 30635,"Long Title: Drunk on Film: The Psychology of Storytelling with Alcohol and Its Effects on Alcohol Consumption.     Alcohol Use Disorder is a chronic relapsing brain disease. But when presented on screen, it's entertainment. Why do we laugh, why do we cry, why do we emulate fictional characters whose drinking habits result in a life of debilitating addiction? From James Bond to Jonah Hill, the psychology and seduction of alcohol on film, television, and online will be analyzed.  Furthermore, what is the relationship between the manner in which alcohol use/abuse is presented on screen and the manner in which alcohol is used and abused on, for example, college campuses? Surveying recent film history, we will examine how alcohol is used in story structure, as a character flaw or strength, and as a narrative device in the story arc of films across multiple film genres, (action/adventure, comedy, romance, etc). Why do characters drink, where do they drink, and how does the result of their getting drunk advance the narrative? We'll also look at non-fiction films that tackle issues of addiction, as a way of comparing character development in Hollywood films to the results of this same behavior in everyday life. Film materials will include weekly screenings outside of class, and academic articles relating to portrayal and analysis of alcohol use in film and television, including the business of marketing alcohol in print and television advertising. From the psychological perspective we will discuss the topic and process of social influence and how the presence of others influences our behavior. Questions of interest will include the following: what are the mechanisms by which group influence unfolds? How and why might we be persuaded? Does the manner, and if so how, in which alcohol use is portrayed in movies and the media reflect the processes and principles of social influence? Readings will include chapters on social influence, persuasion and academic articles evaluating the manner in which alcohol is portrayed and advertised and the effect this has on alcohol consumption. In addition, issues of addiction will be discussed - from understanding the basis of addiction to examining the efficacy of addiction treatment."
PSY 30667,"The Global Childhoods Practicum seeks to provide students with an evidence-based framework and skillset to implement an improvement science approach to research and program learning.

PSY 30691,"This course will draw from multiple perspectives to foster a deep appreciation of human development and ourishing. Human development is complex and fragile, yet many splendored. Assumptions about human nature and capacities have critical and moral implications for how we create institutions (family life, education) and systems (policy, government). e challenge is to develop an integrated and ecological understanding of development in the context of human ourishing. We will begin with research in positive psychology on human development, considering the growth of reasoning, identity, moral imagination, and behavior. We will broaden the frame to include understanding of human capabilities from the perspectives of faith (including the principles of Catholic social teaching), culture, and work. Students interested in social change will benet from a deeper understanding of human development and related research, discussed in a seminar format.

In this contested moment, how might we examine the ideas with which we think as we envision social transformation and work toward solidarity and the common good? We will draw from psychology and neuroscience to understand how to overcome attribution errors, implicit bias, and motivated reasoning in work to promote justice. We will examine how assumptions about knowledge and our theories of mind impact our communication and work, and explore epistemic justice (who is invited to the table of knowledge). We will explore, in seminar format, means to promote intellectual humility, ethical imagination, practical wisdom, and commitment to action. Students will be encouraged to learn through experience and community engagement, and apply the lessons of the course in their own journeys."
PSY 33694,"Almost all crimes, or even human interactions, contain a digital component.  The fact that old laws don't always fit new problems is no more apparent than in the area of cybercrimes.  This course will include discussion of topics including: the methodology of typical cyber investigations, the application of the Fourth Amendment to digital evidence, and different types of cyber-specific laws enforced today.  The course will also focus on the responses of both courts and legislators to the ever-evolving issues presented by computer crimes."

PSY 60354,"In this 3-credit graduate course, we will consider social, emotional, and cognitive influences on behavior. Although taught in separate courses historically, social, emotional, and cognitive aspects of behavior are inextricably intertwined through their systemic, dynamic, and interactive effects on psychological adjustment. Social cognition, for example, defined broadly by the ways we process social interactions and the attributions we make about others' intentions based on their behaviors, determines our emotional reactions to them, shapes our choice of whether to affiliate or disaffiliate with them, and exerts potent effects on our long-term social and emotional wellbeing. Attributions, their causes, and their effects therefore cannot be understood by focusing on social, emotional, or cognitive factors alone. Similarly, volitional emotion regulation requires effortful deployment of cognitive resources, oftentimes to maintain long-term social relationships despite disagreements and disappointments. In both examples, social, emotional, and cognitive processes must be considered as interacting systems. Systems-level thinking is difficult for humans but engages the material at the level of complexity it deserves. We will consider social, emotional, and cognitive influences on behavior in both typical and atypical development. Although individual differences in social behavior, emotion, and cognition are partly heritable, environmental influences are just as important. Traumatic and protracted aversive experiences in childhood, for example, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, discrimination, and racism exert persistent effects on social cognition and behavior, changing the ways we feel and engage with the world around us. We will consider (1) how socioemotional development is shaped within families (normative to high-risk); (2) how adverse childhood experiences and other early life events can shape self-defeating attributional biases and social cognitive rule structures; (3) how attributional biases and social cognitive rule structures influence self-selection of environments (e.g., peer groups, partners, intuitional affiliations); (4) neurobiological systems that subserve social behavior, emotional responding, and mood; and (5) competing theoretical/philosophical perspectives on human cognition and emotion (e,g., evolutionary functionalism, situational functionalism, constructionism)."
PSY 60520,"An Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience is a survey course that introduces students to the biological substrates underlying various forms of cognition in humans, with a specific focus on mental processes.

ROFR 20610,"“Let them eat cake” and “bon appétit” are common expressions used in English to either refer to Marie-Antoinette’s faux pas before the hungry revolutionary crowd asking for bread in front of the Versailles palace, or to traditionally tell somebody to enjoy their meal. More than mere food, French cuisine and dishes have become an art and an inspiration throughout the world. But how are food and cuisine at the core of French culture? How is food such a savoir-vivre for the French people? Brillat-Savarin said in the 18th century: “Tell me what you eat: I’ll tell you who you are.” How did/do French people eat? How did/does that define them? This course aims at better understanding the representations and the symbolic aspects of food and cuisine in French culture. Providing starters from the Middle-Ages, we will take our culinary discovery through the tasty 17th century to the spicy 18th century, adding a dash of table manners and theory in the 19th century, to modern diets and regimens, mixing a variety of formats and recipes.

We also examine films that come from the larger francophone world, from locations such as Algeria and Senegal. Assignments include brief written responses to each of the films under study, an oral presentation, two short papers, and a final paper. We will read two novels that are related to very recent films as well and explore the relationship between the written work and the cinematic creation.

Seeking to transcend the alienation of the journey and his exiled existential state, the poet restlessly pursued in his writings an unstable equilibrium between arrival and departure, shuttling back and forth between residences and literary works: between Avignon and Vaucluse, between the De viris and the Africa, between Naples and Parma, between the De vita solitaria and the De otio, between Milan and Venice, between the Bucolicum carmen and the Epystole, between Padua and Arquà, between the Canzoniere and the Triumphi.  The seminar will be offered in English and will focus primarily on Petrarch's vernacular poetry, both the Canzoniere (Songs and Sonnets) and the Triumphi (The Triumphs), upon which his worldwide literary reputation is based.  But before taking up the Canzoniere and the Triumphi, we will consider the life of Petrarch, his intellectual activities and his other works, including selections from his epistolary collections (Letters on Familiar Matters and Letters of Old Age) and other Latin works, especially the Secretum."

Coerenza / Consistency) will be the springboards for testing a new “quantum theory of literary interpretation” involving six new principles: 1. Indeterminazione / Indeterminacy; 2. Simultaneità / Simultaneity; 3. Sovrapposizione / Superimposition; 4.  Relazionalità / Relationality; 5. Entanglement; 6. Silenzio / Silence).  These new “functions” will be used to interpret a variety of texts originally composed in Italian (though all translated into English) by authors such as Dante Alighieri, James Joyce, Amelia Rosselli, Jhumpa Lahiri, Natalia Ginzburg, Tommaso Landolfi, Italo Calvino, Giorgio Manganelli, Carlo Emilio Gadda, Italo Svevo, Pier Paolo Pasolini.   During the course we will assume that the act of reading, which occurs in a fleeting present, pertains to the futures of texts just as to their pasts. Hence, reading is always a partial projection into the unknown. The aim of our classes will be to reflect on a new modality of reading with a specific focus on interaction, in the awareness that “heretic” readings guided by hermeneutic imponderability, are worthy of investigation just as established and canonical interpretations.

ROSP 30715,"Since its first uses in the Sixteenth Century, the term utopia meant both good place and no place. Thus, the concept carried two different ideas in its own meaning, an ideal society and an unreachable one. In the past years, the concept—as well as its opposite, dystopia—has been applied to explain literary representations of imagined worlds that hold a mirror up to our own real world. Analyzing and discussing cultural products that create, depict, and represent invented societies is, without a doubt, a good path to understand and to critique key aspects of this complex world we live in today. In this class, we will study Early Modern Hispanic texts (written by Late Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque authors) as well as contemporary fictions (films, short stories, plays) that have in common their way to create and describe imagined/utopian/dystopian universes.  We will pay specific attention to descriptions of imagined places in order to see how they explore real tensions around class, gender, society, religion, racial identities, imperial subjects, and power. During the semester, we will read texts written by Cervantes, Colón, Lope de Vega, Tirso de Molina, Cortés, Gracián, Vespucio, Nieremberg, and Fuentelapeña and will watch and analyze films such as Children of Men, Blade Runner, Pan's Labyrinth, Avatar, Elysium, among other contemporary works."

ROSP 40435,"This course offers an introduction to some of the recent thinking and cultural phenomena on the Anthropocene. In order to do that, we will pay particular attention to contemporary Iberian Cinema, Cultural Critique, and Critical Theory. Although we will focus on contemporary Spain in particular, we will ultimately attempt to come to terms with our current geological and civilizational epoch as mainly humanly driven. For that purpose, under examination and question will be primitive accumulation and Capitalism, humanism and posthumanism, rural depopulation, consumerism, energy use, industrial relocation, technicity (social networks, smartphones, big data, Google, etc.); droughts, wildfires, human and planetary finitude, etc. We will ultimately seek to bear witness to the Anthropocene and its consequences through cinema, culture and thought, if such a thing is possible.

ROSP 40771,"While she was living in exile in Cuba in the 1890s, Puerto Rican Poet Lola Rodríguez de Tió wrote the following lines, which are among the most iconic in Hispanic Caribbean verse: Cuba y Puerto Rico son de de un pájaro las dos alas, / reciben flores y balas en un mismo corazón.... At the time these lines were seen as a testament to the the similar histories that these two Caribbean islands had developed after some four centuries of Spanish rule, but, as one critic has put it, they can also be seen as a chilling presage of what was to come after the U.S. won the Spanish American War in 1898 and became a consistent presence in the future of both countries.  In this class we will explore, through the study of Cuban and Puerto Rican History and Literature, the islands' many shared legacies such as colonialism, slavery, political unrest, and US intervention.  Moreover, through readings of works by a variety of authors and literary genres, we will examine the many political, economic, social and cultural factors that have served to shape each island's identity over the past five centuries.  Students will be required to write journal entries for each class, several short papers, and a final essay. There will also be a mid-term exam."
ROSP 40845,"We have recently witnessed a wave of debates about monuments (statues of military figures, explorers, conquerors, rulers, etc.). Moreover, many of those monuments have been intervened, vandalized moved, covered, and even topped down, fueling a series of controversies that invite us to reflect about the constantly shifting politics of memory and about the political effectiveness of pursuing symbolic justice in the public space. This is a Cultural Studies undergraduate research seminar devoted to a selection of important public monuments in Latin America; this is, statues, monoliths, and architectural visual signs that attempt to memorialize historical events and people as well as cultural and political values. We will examine their history as well as their paradoxical semiotic fate: no monument is able to install the memory it pretends to make eternal. Monuments are floating signifiers destine to be appropriated, re-signified, toppled down, and, eventually, forgotten."

ROSP 63730,"The goal of this graduate seminar is to analyze Latin American literature in the cultural-historical period of the so-called modernizing impact, which covers the last two decades of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, and is commonly known as Modernismo. The journey will focus on the birth of the genre of the modern chronicle, a hybrid zone between literature and journalism, between information and imagination, between politics and the market. In Latin America, this complex object has brought together numerous critical perspectives that read local modernization against the backdrop of global modernity, whether as a dyschronic modernity (Ángel Rama), a disconnected modernity (Julio Ramos), a peripheral modernity (Beatriz Sarlo), a dissonant modernity (Gwen Kirkpatrick), a translinguistic modernity (Julio Ortega), or a modernity in translation (Mariano Siskind). From the discussion of these fundamental perspectives for the study of the field, specific prose texts by Rubén Darío, José Martí, Julián del Casal, Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera, Juana Borrero, Enrique Gómez Carrillo, Zoila Aurora Cáceres, María Eugenia Vaz Ferreira, Delmira Agustini and Julio Herrera y Reissig will be addressed. The chronicles of modernity will serve as a platform to reflect on current and relevant problems in literary studies, such as the representation of American cities, the crisis of modern subjectivity, the tension between the Eurocentrism of global modernity and American nationalisms, migratory processes, the phenomenon of secularization, the emergence of mass culture, the transition from the model of the nineteenth-century literary man to that of the professional writer, the role of translation, and the assimilation of cultural traditions foreign to the Latin American sphere."

ROSP 63915,"The emergence of Covid-19 and the ways in which the pandemic was managed brought to the fore the importance of biopolitics. Although debates on biopolitics and animality have focused mainly on capitalist societies, the ontological division between human and not human exposed in those debates also shapes dynamics of power in socialist regimes. This creates a paradox for official discourses based on emancipation from capitalism and neoliberalism.  Taking as a point of departure Cuba's intervention in Angola and Venezuela, two oil-producing nations, we will examine common imaginaries in relation to the body and the flesh expressed in cinema, performance, and literature from the three countries. These works reveal, on the one hand, the state's sacrificial power over people's bodies and, on the other, examples of self-determination that defy state power without necessarily having an ideological or programmatic agenda. Understanding that discussions about biopolitics exceed disciplinary academic limits, we will use readings on history, and literary and cultural criticism to analyze the corpus."

RU 30350,"The claim that Russians and Ukrainians are one people, “a single whole,” has been resounding in Russian mass media, film, and other discourses for the last two decades. Putin took a pronounced colonial turn with his return to the Presidency in 2012, describing Russia as a state-civilization, in which Russians and Ukrainians are joined in “spiritual unity.” History thus serves as a justification for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This course will look at historical facts and cultural artifacts of Russia and Ukraine to determine the roots of Russia’s current aggression in Ukraine. Among others, the course will discuss the following questions. Is Kyivan Rus part of Russian or Ukrainian history, or neither? Does Ukraine have its own history and culture that is distinct from Russian? Are Ukrainians divided into Russian-speakers (aspiring to join Russia) and Ukrainian-speaking nationalists (aspiring to EU)? The course will examine the origins, points of intersection and divergence of Ukrainian and Russian cultures through the lens of history, art, and literature from the Christianization of Rus (10th century) to the present time. We will look at the history of Russian imperialism, centuries of appropriation of Ukrainian cultural achievements, annihilation of Ukrainian traditions, extermination of Ukrainian intellectuals, and the politics of Russification with the purpose to see how the current events reflect a tendency that has already existed for centuries.

Nearly three decades after this country transformed into what we now call post-Soviet space, the legacy of the USSR looms large in international politics and culture. This course will offer students an introduction to Soviet history through film, which Lenin famously called the most important of the arts, and literature, which Soviet writers used to engineer human souls. Since the 1917 Revolution, art has had a close relationship to the Soviet state. At the same time, writers and filmmakers with individualistic and even rebellious tendencies have created some of the twentieth century's greatest masterpieces, including Dziga Vertov's Man With a Movie Camera and Mikhail Bulgakov's Master and Margarita. In this class we will explore how this tense relationship between art and the state developed in the first half of the twentieth century. Since cultural context is an important lens for our analysis, each artistic work will be accompanied by historical readings about the period in which it was produced, as well as artistic manifestos and contemporary reviews, when relevant.

In this course, we will be reading Russophone short stories from the 19 th through the 21 st centuries that grapple with these two philosophically beguiling ideas. Authors like Gogol, Dostoevsky, Korolenko, Babel, Teffi, and others ask: Does love exist and can it be knowable or comprehensible?

The multi-faceted nature of poverty and its implications when it comes to business and entrepreneurship are explored. Attention is devoted to venture creation as a pathway out of poverty, and to how the larger business community can be leveraged in poverty alleviation efforts. Students will examine case studies and meet low income entrepreneurs."
SEI 40090,"Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation Practicum is a culminating capstone course for students in the Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation (SEI) Minor. Students will engage in a supervised experiential or research-related project that will advance their  learning and involve the application of SEI principles. It is expected that the student's project will directly address a local, national or international social issue or cause and/or advance the field of social entrepreneurship."
SEI 40110,"Could business be an instrument of peace or is it more likely to be an agent of division that foments conflict? While the course will touch on questions of whether trade and economic development as well as different economic systems impact causes of violence, the class focuses specifically on the role of for-profit and non-profit institutions within the context of current economic systems. This course draws upon three perspectives to undertake a 360-degree assessment of this question about business's role. First, it will examine the ways in which the actions of business exploit populations, profit from war-making, and sometimes actively engage in the promotion of violence. Second, it looks at an area of academic inquiry sometimes called Business For Peace, in which the ways in which businesses can be instruments of peace have been explored. The ways businesses might do this include being more actively involved in peacemaking and peacekeeping in zones of conflict as well as more general, incremental forms of peace building that could occur both in and outside of zones of conflict. Third, the course looks at newer, nuanced theories from political theorists that assess the positives and negatives of the role of business in engagement in peace."
SEI 40999,"Students, in a structured format, are involved in assessing, prioritizing and creatively solving problems encountered by low-income and other disadvantaged South Bend entrepreneurs. A process consulting approach is employed and a number of useful tools and frameworks are introduced. Students work with both for-profit and non-profit enterprises, producing tangible deliverables that help clients launch, grow and sustain their ventures. In addition to class time, students will meet with clients on a weekly basis at a Notre Dame facility located downtown. Assistance with transportation will be available for students needing it. Class will meet on Tuesdays. On Thursdays, students will consult with local entrepreneurs in one hour blocks during the hours of 5p to 9p at the Center for Civic Innovation. This consulting time is flexible with students' schedules and based on appointments made by local entrepreneurs."
SMAC 20401,"On July 1, 2021, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) granted to Division I student-athletes the right to commercialize (i.e. make money from) their Name, Image and Likeness (NIL). The goal was to provide student-athletes with the same rights their non-athlete student peers have long enjoyed: the ability to earn compensation in exchange for their NIL by, for example, endorsing a product, selling their autograph, or giving sport lessons.   One year after NIL legislation went into effect, the NIL landscape continues to evolve and change, leaving many confused about how to navigate these new opportunities. In this course, students will develop an understanding of: 1) what Name, Image and Likeness opportunities look like in real life, 2) the relevant NCAA, legal and policy guidelines, 3) the personal and environmental factors that can influence how people choose to engage in NIL activities, 4) their personal motivations, interests and goals related to NIL opportunities and, 5) the resources available to help them maximize their NIL opportunities while at ND.   Students will be evaluated based on their engagement with guest speakers, collaboration with one another, and their performance in presentations, quizzes and a reflective essay."
SMAC 30101,"Sports play a big role in American culture. From pick up soccer and the Baraka Bouts to fantasy football and the Olympics, sports articulate American identities, priorities, aspirations, and concerns. They reflect our dominant values but also highlight our divisions and serve as a means to question those values. Athletes, organizers, spectators, fans, and the media all have a stake. This course will examine sport's role in American society and culture thematically, covering the late 19th century to present and paying special attention to sport as a physical performance (including issues of danger, drugs, disability, spectatorship, and fandom), sport as an expression of identity (the construction of race, gender, class, community, and nation), sport as a form of labor (with issues of power and control, safety, and amateurism), and sport as a cultural narrative (how do writers, historians, and the media attach meaning to it?). We will examine history, journalism, documentary film, and television coverage; topics will range from Victorian bicyclists and early college football to Muhammad Ali. Requirements include reading and regular discussion, a variety of short analytical papers, and a culminating project in which students will choose one course theme to analyze through a topic of their own choice."
SMAC 30107,"This course is about telling great, factual stories within the realm of human endeavor we call sport. That is, you will read and write substantial nonfiction narratives, and your main subject of inquiry will be near-at-hand happenings in sport, play, and performance. You can call it longform sportswriting, literary journalism, creative nonfiction, or anything in between—and, indeed, this course will ask you to interrogate the boundaries between subgenres in the literature of fact. Through your ethical efforts in research, exploration, and storytelling, you will seek to define and describe real-world truth through the art of the longform essay. With guidance, you will look for potential stories locally—on campus, or nearby—request access and permission to tell those stories, and gather material en route to crafting meaningful narratives. Together, we will ask fundamental questions about the time-honored act of storytelling and explore the history of the “longform” narrative form. What impact—culturally, socially, politically—can a well-told story have? We will build personal toolkits for writing nonfiction while reading and discussing exemplary essays. We will ask big questions about the role of sport and play in culture, mindful of local significance: What is the relationship between play and identity, for instance? How do conceptions of race, class, or gender find expression (or deconstruction) in sport? How does socioeconomic division affect access to sport and play in America? Most fundamentally, in this course, we will write and share our work with others. This course requires the completion of a substantial writing project, among other assignments, and you should be prepared to spend time with real people and your writing subjects outside of class time, and often according to their schedules."
SMAC 30108,"This class will survey the various historical and contemporary dimensions of Asian American experiences including immigration and integration, family and community dynamics, ethnic/gender/class identity, as well as transnational and diasporic experiences. We will explore contemporary and historical issues of racism, the model minority myth, inter-generational relationships, and the educational experiences of Asian Americans. To accomplish this, our class will pose such questions as: Who is Asian American? How did racism create Chinatown? Is there an Asian advantage? Coursework includes essays based on topics of your choice, presentations, and a creative narrative."
SMAC 30109,"Football is one of the most enduringly popular and significant cultural activities in the United States. Since the late 19th century, football has occupied an important place for those wishing to define and understand America. And Notre Dame football plays a central role in that story, with larger-than-life figures and stories, from Knute Rockne's Win one for the Gipper line to the 'Four Horsemen' backfield that led the program to a second national championship in 1924. The mythic proportions of the University's football program cast a long shadow on the institution's history, cultural significance, and traditions. This course focuses on Notre Dame football history as an entry point into larger questions about the cultural, historical, and social significance of football in the U.S. Who has been allowed to play on what terms? How have events from Notre Dame football's past been remembered and re-imagined? How has success in Notre Dame football been defined and redefined? In particular, the course will focus on how Notre Dame football became a touchstone for Catholic communities and institutions across the country navigating the fraught terrain of immigration, whiteness, and religious practice. This course will take up those questions through significant engagement with University Archive collections related to Notre Dame football, working toward increased levels of description and access for these materials. This course will include hands-on work with metadata, encoding and markup, digitization, and digital preservation/access through a collaboration with the University Archives and the Navari Family Center for Digital Scholarship. Readings for this course will include chapters from texts such as Murray Sperber's Shake Down the Thunder: The Creation of Notre Dame Football (1993), TriStar Pictures' Rudy (1993), Steve Delsohn's Talking Irish: The Oral History of Notre Dame Football (2001), Jerry Barca's Unbeatable: Notre Dame's 1988 Championship and the Last Great College Football Season (2014), David Roediger's Working Toward Whiteness: How America's Immigrants Became White (2005), David Roediger's The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class (1991), and Noel Ignatiev's How the Irish Became White (1995). Class meetings will be split between discussions of conceptual readings and applied work with library and information science technologies and systems. Coursework may include response papers, hands-on work with data, and a final project. Familiarity with archival methods, library/information science, data science, or computer science tools and methods is NOT a prerequisite for this course."
SMAC 30201,"The course is designed to raise students' ability to recognize and resolve ethical issues in sports, but also more broadly in business, accounting and life.  Accordingly, this course will ask students to examine a variety of issues through various ethical lenses. Topics will vary from semester to semester, but are likely to include the ethical dimensions of: college athletics, including amateurism, compensation, and unionization; wellness, focusing on everything from finances to doping; corruption, including gambling, college academic and admissions scandals, and FIFA; and sports and the common good, i.e., can sports advance issues as diverse as gender and racial equity and sustainable economic development in the form of stadium construction and hosting the Olympic Games.  In addition to critical thinking, students will be well served by curiosity, skepticism and keeping an open mind.  Requirements typically include in-class participation, a presentation on a current ethical issue in sports, and two exams."
SMAC 30603,"This course is on the economics of sports, and aims to use economic principles, theories, and tools to analyze the organization of the sports industry and sports markets, the activities of professional and amateur athletes, the effects of sports on the broader economy, and strategic behavior in sports settings. Topics include the industrial organization of professional sports leagues, the labor economics and labor markets in both professional and amateur sports, the public economics and politics of the funding of sports, the economic impact of the sports industry, as well as the application of microeconomic theory to strategic decision-making in sports."
SMAC 30604,"Almost 40% of the world's population is overweight or has obesity. Obesity has become a central focus in biological research as well as policy. Billions of dollars have been spent on public health interventions, biological interventions, diets, and exercise regimens. However, the obesity rate among adults and children has been steadily increasing globally. Why is this happening? How do we even define obesity? Does that definition truly reflect health? Why do we even have fat to begin with...actually what even is fat?!? Why are humans prone to obesity? These are just some of the questions we will address in this class. Using non-traditional methods and assignments, we will discuss adipose tissue and digestive physiology, the role evolution has played in the human propensity to hold onto fat, diet and exercise, food insecurity, therapeutic interventions, as well as the physical and mental health consequences of having obesity. We will use this as a basis to investigate the biological and cultural factors including stigma, race, and gender that shape our perceptions of body image and health in the midst of the obesity epidemic. Finally, this course will include occasional laboratory exercises to familiarize you with the methods used to assess body mass, body composition, metabolic rate, and point of care measures of biomarkers like glucose and cholesterol."
SMAC 40101,"Sports and recreation are a huge part of American life. What we do for fun reflects who we are and what we aspire to be as individuals, as members of a group or subculture, and as a nation. Amusement parks, city parks, national parks, stadiums, and sports fields shape the built and natural world around us; sports media, outdoor recreation, and tourism represent billion-dollar industries and influence American politics and culture. Because sports and recreation foster community and identity, they also become sites of conflict. As a result, they provide a useful lens for examining major themes and questions integral to the field of American Studies. Just as Introduction to American Studies served as your gateway to the major, this seminar will be the culminating experience. Readings and assignments will explore research and scholarship examining sports and recreation in the context of American Studies as a field, and students will develop research projects on a topic of their own choice. Requirements will include seminar-style discussions of assigned readings, a final research project of 20-25 pages, and an oral presentation of that project in class, as well as some smaller writing assignments."

SMAC 47909,"Capstone projects synthesize and reflect upon the student's work within the minor in some public-facing way. They ask students to contribute to public discourses on sports, media, and culture. Each student will plan and develop a project with the help of the director and a faculty or staff mentor. Capstone projects may build from a course, senior thesis, internship, research project, or service program, or they may be a separate project. Capstone projects should reflect the student's academic and professional interests, and may take a variety of forms such as a public poster presentation or talk, online digital humanities project, curated museum or library exhibit, print journalism, podcast, video, or the organization and introduction of public programming such as a panel discussion, film screening, or visiting speaker."

The answers to these questions are central to our well-being as individuals and as a society. In this course, you will learn how sociologists approach and answer these questions. During the semester, you will explore our society through a variety of lines of inquiry. What is the link between individuals and their culture? How is social interaction structured and how does this affect our behavior? What is inequality? How do institutions influence our lives?  The over-arching purpose of the course is to cultivate your sociological imagination, which can then be used to better understand yourself and your place in the larger world."
SOC 10342,"The family is often agreed to be the primary and most fundamental of social institutions. It is within this institution that early socialization and care-giving usually take place, and therefore, many of our ideas about the world are closely tied to our families. This course will give students the opportunity to learn about the diverse forms the family has taken over time and across different groups. This knowledge will be useful in examining the ongoing debate about the place of the family in social life. By taking a sociological approach to learning about the family and by gaining knowledge about national family trends and patterns in the U.S., this course will give students the theoretical and empirical tools for understanding how family life is linked to the social structure; to economic, cultural, and historical events and transitions; and to societal factors like race, class, and gender."
SOC 10672,"How does social life influence religion?  How does religion influence society?  What is religion's social significance in a complex society like ours?

The course examines the social bases of churches, sects, and cults, and it focuses on contemporary religion in the United States"
SOC 10722,"The overarching goal of this course is to provide students with a working knowledge of social psychology and, with that knowledge, to increase awareness of ourselves, the social world around us, and the connections between the two.  This is a course about social interaction - how the self shapes and is shaped by others, how we interact in and with groups and social structures, and how we perceive the world around us. Because the subject of the course is the very social interactions in which we are immersed, it is expected that students will develop the habit of applying social psychological concepts to everyday life."
SOC 10732,"Introduction to Criminology provides students with an overview of the sociological study of law making, law breaking and the resulting social responses. In this class we not only look at a variety of crimes, but we also discuss the varying methods sociologists use to collect, interpret and evaluate data, as well as how we theorize about crime and punishment. We address questions such as Why are some people or groups labeled as criminal, while others are not? Do laws in both their construction and enforcement serve everyone's interests equally? How can the communities in which people are embedded be considered as criminogenic? How are poverty, race, gender and other social factors related to crime? "
SOC 10870,"Most Americans think of the “inner city” as a place of misery, danger, and despair. Why do most American cities have racially segregated areas dominated by concentrated poverty? What are the lives of inner city residents like? Why do the legal, political, economic, and educational institutions that serve these communities struggle so mightily to improve the lives of inner city residents? In this course, we will address all of these questions by viewing all five seasons of The Wire, David Simon’s epic tale of life in inner city Baltimore. Sociological theory and research will serve as powerful tools to help students “decode” The Wire, and better understand of the social forces that create and sustain inner city poverty, violence, and disorder."

SOC 20010,"Psychiatry and mental healthcare have been the target of criticism and controversy for decades. Common critiques are that the field is not grounded in medical science, that it pathologizes normal problems in living, or that it is a method of social control. This course will focus on the social movements that have been critical of mental healthcare from the second half of the twentieth century to today. We will begin by considering questions such as: What is the proper role of mental healthcare? What is a social movement? What is the relationship between mental healthcare and politics? Then we will shift to discussing particular social movements including antipsychiatry, Mad Pride, the emergence of the concepts of disability and neurodiversity as alternatives to pathology, and other examples of service-user led activism. The goal of the course will be to better understand the ways that psychiatry has abused it power and imagine changes that could be made to the system to improve the lives of those who suffer from mental health conditions."
SOC 20033,"The United States is beset by many serious social problems such as educational inequality, extreme poverty alongside unparalleled abundance, crime and deviance, health disparities, mass incarceration, and the persistence of discrimination along lines of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, class, gender, and sexuality. Course materials are designed to engage student learning, illustrate the distinctive features of the sociological perspective, and to start you thinking sociologically about yourself and the broader world. To think sociologically requires you to recognize that our contemporary world, with its enduring cultural, political, and economic institutions, is as much a social product as we are. In this course, students will learn to take a sociological perspective not only in examining the causes, consequences, and solutions to some of society’s most troubling social problems, but also in taking a critical look at their own perceptions of problems."
SOC 20228,"Many have claimed that the American educational system is the great equalizer.  In other words, the educational system gives everyone a chance to prosper in American society regardless of their social origins.  In this course, we will explore the validity of this claim.  We will consider questions such as: 1) Does our educational system promote social mobility or social reproduction? 2) How has the relationship between race/ethnicity and educational performance changed in the last few decades? 3) How do social class and gender shape the kinds of educational experiences students have? 4) How does educational policy influence the kinds of experiences kids have in school? Can policy reduce inequality?"

SOC 20558,"The objective of this course is to explore how and why individuals and social groups rebel against authority, particularly in risky situations when rebellion is likely to incur significant personal and collective costs. This course will investigate the conditions that stoke rebellion against immoral and oppressive power structures, shared conditions, and social norms; how we know when authorities are acting immorally or unjustly; why injustice and illegitimacy only fuel rebellion in some cases and induce conformity in others; the various forms that resistance and rebellion can take; and the factors that shape rebellion's varied forms, such as exit, sabotage, protest, withholding, reclamation, violent struggle, and revolution. The empirical topics covered will address a range of rebellion under tyranny, including but not limited to rebellion during slavery in the United States, rebellion against Nazi power and the Holocaust during World War II, and resistance to colonialism and imperialism."

Yet, the threat that racism holds on our nation's most cherished ideals of democracy and justice is hardly new. Generations of activists, scholars, and everyday people have fought and persevered to bring about social, cultural, and policy change. This course engages deeply with topics relevant to the national discourse on racial and ethnic relations in the U.S. The first part of the course examines key concepts, focusing on the social construction of race and ethnicity, prejudice, and discrimination. The second part reviews the historical experiences of Native Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans. The third and final part of the course centers on four critical issues that are especially relevant in 2020: (1) immigration; (2) political disenfranchisement; (3) racial and ethnic disparities in health; and (4) racism in the criminal justice system."

SOC 30900,"Sociology 30900 is a course that is meant to introduce the undergraduate students who enroll, most of whom are majors in sociology, to the origins, development, and uses of sociological theory. In that pursuit, the course seeks to explain how theoretical ideas emerge, how perspectives are framed, and how vantage points for viewing society and its operations shift over time. To achieve these ends, special attention is devoted to prominent thinkers, both classical and contemporary, in the history of social thought, from the early critics of modern industrialism like Karl Marx to ironic commentators on present-day social practices such as Erving Goffman.  Foundations of Sociological Theory is also a writing-intensive course in the liberal-arts curriculum. This means that students in the class, at the same time that they are reading and studying theory, will work on improving their skills as writers of clear, objective, and persuasive prose.    "
SOC 30902,"Sociology 30902 is designed to provide an overview of research methods in the social sciences. Topics covered include (1) hypothesis formulation and theory construction; (2) the measurement of sociological variables; and (3) data collection techniques - experimental, survey, and observational. At the end of the course, students should appreciate both the strengths and the limitations of sociological research methods."
SOC 30903,"We frequently encounter statements or claims based on statistics, such as: Women earn less than men, The American population is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse, or Married people are healthier than unmarried people. On what information are these statements based? What kinds of evidence support or refute such claims? How can we assess their accuracy? This course will show students how to answer these sorts of questions by interpreting and critically evaluating statistics commonly used in the analysis of social science data. Hands-on data analysis and interpretation are an important part of the course. You will gain the skills to conduct quantitative data analysis using a statistical software package.  You should finish the course with the ability to interpret, question, and discuss statistics accurately and with an understanding of which type of statistic is appropriate for different kinds of data and research questions. No prior statistical knowledge is required. This course is ideal for students interested in the social and/or life sciences as well as business and/or law."
SOC 30952,"This rigorous, hands-on, interdisciplinary seminar prepares students to design and execute an independent international field research project. The course enhances your ability to conduct your own research, but also teaches techniques that will be useful for the rest of your academic studies, and for understanding research results presented to you through popular press in your life after college. This class is unique because throughout, your learning and work are geared specifically to your selected research interests. The first part of the class guides students through the steps of refining a research project and preparing a research proposal. The second part of the class will help students hone their ability to conduct research through a series of research practicums: students get hands-on experience in a variety of methodological approaches through research conducted in the local area. Because of the over-arching nature of the course, we will touch on topics of research design, such as developing a research question, a theoretical framework, and hypothesis testing, as well as analysis of data and evidence. However, we encourage students to see this course as a complement, rather than a substitute, for discipline specific research methods and analysis courses.  "
SOC 33028,"Work on a real-world project that can impact Native American education in the present while learning the history that shaped the modern era. Native American Education is deeply intertwined with American history, education, and policy. The current American government is seriously investigating the past uses of education as a tool for assimilation (and worse) in Native American communities. In 2022 the Pope went to Canada and apologized for the role the Church played in the residential boarding schools, and the Subcommittee on Native American issues for the USCCB is investigating the same here in the United States. This course blends primary source historical work with active and engaging projects with Native communities to engage students in both history and historical thought to do consulting and problem-solving that will help shape real policy in the present day!

The course has a practical focus. Some classes are devoted to equipping students with knowledge and skills that will serve them as they progress through the major. Other classes focus on future plans, such as entering the work force, going on to graduate or professional school, and performing service after the baccalaureate. The idea of career as vocation is also explored. This course is for one credit, pass/fail, and is required of all sociology majors."
SOC 33638,"Discussions about curriculum and pedagogy in education have, for the most part, been limited and limiting, exploring curriculum as a written plan of study (often handed down by the state or a district) and pedagogy as the mere equivalence of teacher instruction. Using some foundational and contemporary theories in education combined with those with ideas from public pedagogy and cultural studies, the intent of this course is to broaden and complexify our understandings of curriculum and pedagogy - what they are, what they entail, where and by whom they are enacted, and, mostly, what they do in education when conceived in more broader terms.   Using a variety of texts, both in and outside of education, we will explore how pedagogy and curriculum combine with the public to operate - to -educate - in spaceslike a college campus, a theme park, a museum, a textbook, a classroom, a mall or grocery store, or through popular cultural texts such as film, advertising, social media, and/or newspapers.   Going back and forth between discussions of curricular artifacts and pedagogical understandings in education proper and those public texts noted above, we will examine how curriculum and pedagogy operate in both formal and informal educational settings, what one may learn from the other, and, in the process, re-imagine what these terms could mean in the context of K-12 education."

Students will also be encouraged to develop ideas for their own independent senior thesis project during their time in the apprenticeship.  Students in this course must fill out an application to be considered. At the beginning of each semester, the Director of Undergraduate Studies sends an e-mail to all Sociology majors with a list of the available research projects along with instructions on how to apply for them. All Sociology majors are eligible. (This course is for one credit and is repeatable; the grade structure is S/U.) Department approval required. "
SOC 40200,"The goal of the course is to compare the processes by which social scientists and filmmakers/photographers engage in social documentation. Students explore how global social problems such as rural and urban poverty, race and gender inequalities, immigration, and violence are analyzed across the social sciences, and depicted in a variety of documentary film and photography genres. The course also explores the role that documentary photography and film play in promoting rights and advocating for social change, particularly in the realm of human rights and global inequality. It examines the history of documentary film and photography in relationship to politics, and to the development of concerns across the social sciences with inequality and social justice. It also looks at how individual documentarians, non-profit organizations and social movements use film and photography to further their goals and causes, and issues of representation their choices raise. The course is also unique because it requires students to engage in the process of visual documentation themselves by incorporating an activity-based learning component. For their final project, students choose a human rights or social problem that concerns or interests them (and which they can document locally - no travel is required), prepare a documentary -exhibit- on the chosen topic (10-12 photographs), and write a 12-15 page paper analyzing how 2-3 social scientists construct and frame the given problem. Students also have the option to produce a short documentary film."
SOC 40416,"What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films. Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba)."
SOC 40875,"This course offers an in-depth analysis of the roles of structural and cultural violence in peace studies. Unit 1 (conceptual/theoretical) explores field-formative debates over the nature, basis, and viability of structural violence and cultural violence as analytical concepts, asking how they have shaped (or failed to, but perhaps ought to shape) the field of peace studies. We will examine their critical appropriations of early critical theory, and assess comparable theoretical approaches such as reflexive sociology (Pierre Bourdieu and Loic Wacquant), post-structural analysis (Michel Foucault), and later critical theory (Nancy Fraser and Axel Honneth) while asking what advantages, if any, lenses of structural and cultural violence have vis-à-vis these resources for peace analysis and peacebuilding, and where they need to be supplemented. Unit 2 (cases/agents) studies cases in which some version of these analytical lenses have been deployed for purposes of peace analysis and peacebuilding. We examine recent uses of these lenses to examine poverty, global development, and global health in building peace (e.g. Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Paul Farmer, Peter Uvin), religious/cultural identity (Veena Das), and race, class, and gender (Joshua Price on incarceration and prison abolition in the U.S; Alex Mikulich and Laurie Cassidy on white complicity in hyper incarceration)."
SOC 43402,"Demography, the science of population, is concerned with virtually everything that influences, or can be influenced by, population size, distribution, processes, structure, or characteristics. This course pays particular attention to the causes and consequences of population change. Changes in fertility, mortality, migration, technology, lifestyle, and culture have dramatically affected the United States and the other nations of the world. These changes have implications for a number of areas: hunger, the spread of illness and disease, environmental degradation, health services, household formation, the labor force, marriage and divorce, care for the elderly, birth control, poverty, urbanization, business marketing strategies, and political power. An understanding of these is important as business, government, and individuals attempt to deal with the demands of the changing population."
SOC 43513,"Why do some countries have higher levels of social, economic and political development than others?  While focusing on the record of specific cases, this course focuses on a critical examination of the sociological theories that try to answer the various ramifications of this question."
SOC 43579,"One would think that secrets are hard to keep, and lies hard to maintain, because it doesn't take much for the truth to escape, and once it's out, it can't be put back into the bottle. Yet secrets and lies reside at the heart of much social and political order, sometimes for years and even decades at a time. The objective of this course is to advance our scientific understanding of how this is possible, drawing on sociological, psychological, and historical research on such things as performance, secrecy, lying, forgetting, doubt, denial, and inattention. Case studies will include instances of corporate malfeasance (such as Ponzi schemes and insider trading), Big Tobacco's cover-up of the health consequences of smoking, Watergate, the secret British program to break the German cipher during WWII, elaborate attempts to cover up government atrocities, the cat-and-mouse game between international inspectors and regimes thought to be developing banned weapons, and the plague of misinformation surrounding recent elections. Throughout, we will be concerned with the distinct methodological challenges of studying things many people want to keep secret. Requirements will include midterm and final examinations, reading quizzes/reaction papers, participation, and a final research paper."
SOC 43839,"America is the richest country in the world and yet roughly three million American children now grow up in families surviving on just $2 a day. As America's richest 0.1% have seen their incomes more than quadruple over the last forty years, the incomes for 90% of Americans have barely changed. These financial disparities reflect deeper inequities in educational opportunity, incarceration rates, social status and more.   In this course, we will examine the nature and consequences of American inequality. Through close reading and spirited discussion, we will address such questions as: What is the meaning of meritocracy in an age of profound inequality? What is the lived experience of American poverty and American privilege? How are race and gender inequalities (re)produced throughout the life course? And, finally, how do all of these issues manifest in the successes and struggles of students at Notre Dame?"
SOC 43990,"Social networks are an increasingly important form of social organization. Social networks help to link persons with friends, families, co-workers and formal organizations. Via social networks information flows, support is given and received, trust is built, resources are exchanged, and interpersonal influence is exerted. Rather than being static, social networks are dynamic entities. They change as people form and dissolve social ties to others during the life course. Social networks have always been an important part of social life:  in our kinship relations, our friendships, at work, in business, in our communities and voluntary associations, in politics, in schools, and in markets. Our awareness of and ability to study social networks has increased dramatically with the advent of social media and new communication tools through which people interact with others. Through email, texting, Facebook, Twitter and other platforms, people connect and communicate with others and leave behind traces of those interactions. This provides a rich source of data that we can use to better understand our connections to each other; how these connections vary across persons and change over time; and the impact that they have on our behaviors, attitudes, and tastes. This course will introduce students to (1) important substantive issues about, and empirical research on, social networks; (2) theories about network evolution and network effects on behavior; and (3) tools and methods that students can use to look at and analyze social networks. The course will be a combination of lectures, discussions and labs. Course readings will include substantive research studies, theoretical writings, and methodological texts. Through this course students will learn about social networks by collecting data on social networks and analyzing that data."
SOC 45000,"The Sociology Internship[ is a community-based learning course designed to give students some practical experience in the area of urban affairs, social welfare, education, health care, or business, in order to test their interest, complement their academic work, or acquire work experience preparatory to future careers.  Students are placed in a community agency in the South Bend area and normally work seven hours per week as interns under the supervision of an experienced practitioner. Scheduling hours is a flexible process in order to accommodate the intern's availability and the needs of the host agency. While there are no prerequisites, preference is given to Sociology majors, ALPP or SCPP majors, PSIM minors, and students who have had course work in an area related to social concerns. This is a graded course. In addition to field work, academic work includes reading scholarly works related to the field placement, periodic group meetings with the instructor and others in the course, periodic short reports, and a final paper. Departmental approval is required.   The following is a list of agencies that have accepted interns. Students may also request placement in an agency they find on their own (subject to approval by the instructor).

By the end of the course students will have the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge to begin learning Linear Regression (the first course in the Sociology Department’s required statistics and methods sequence). This course is designed for students with no experience in statistical analysis and as a refresher course to prepare others for Linear Regression. This course focuses on theory but we will utilize the statistics program Stata during a few sessions. You will use Stata in up-coming statistics courses. 
SOC 63091,"The proseminar is designed to acquaint first-year graduate students with the professional requirements of the field of sociology. The course will cover such topics as how to be a good graduate student, how to get research started, preparing for the job market during graduate school, and how to write for sociological outlets. Students will also attend department colloquia given by faculty and advanced graduate students."
SOC 63120,"The Culture and Theory workshop supports student and faculty work by 1) discussing work in progress, 2) developing skills around theorization and argumentation, and 3) offering support for professionalization in these fields. Our definitions of culture and theory are necessarily broad and cross-disciplinary. The workshop is appropriate for students from any sociological subfield, and participants need not self-identify as theorists or culture people in order to substantially involve their work through participation. Our community is even open to papers that might not have a cultural or theoretical dimension but that might benefit from one."
SOC 63125,"Do cultures reflect societies?  Do social institutions reflect culture?  Or are social institutions themselves texts?  What part does culture play in consensus formation, in domination, and in resistance?  How has the relation between culture and social institutions changed?  We will survey some of the central issues in the sociology of culture, and their implications for sociological analysis and understanding more generally.  We will review classic statements of the relation between culture and institutions, and exemplars in the renaissance of sociological work on culture.  Case studies will illustrate different approaches.  According to student interest, these may be selected from work on specialized cultural institution like art and the mass media, or from more broadly based studies of meaning and value."
SOC 63278,"This course focuses on new and innovative research in the substantive area of sociology of education. Several different formats are used during the semester. First, prominent scholars from outside Notre Dame are invited to present their on-going research to seminar participants. Second, seminar participants (faculty and graduate students) are encouraged to present their on-going research in order to receive feedback to help improve the quality of their scholarship. Finally, some classes may focus on a recently published paper that is particularly influential and relevant for future research."
SOC 63572,"This course will introduce students to major theories, topics, debates, and cases in the field of social movements and collective action. In this course, we will answer, among other things, what defines a social movement? Under what conditions do social movements emerge, thrive, and decline? Why do people get involved in social movements? What effects do social movements have on the lives of people who participate in them? On governmental policies, elected officials, and broader cultural expressions? How do social movements spread? What is the relationship between mobilization and repression and mobilization and countermobilization? As these questions indicate, the primary goal of this course is to explain the various processes and dynamics involved in social movements and collective action. To achieve this goal, we will draw on both classical and contemporary theoretical perspectives and empirical analysis, covering such important cases of collective action as the U.S. civil rights movement, the U.S. Central America peace movement, the East German revolution, anti-nuclear movements, animal rights movements, gay and lesbian movements, abortion activism, and terrorism. This course will also help students prepare for the comprehensive examination in social movements and collective action."

Workshop readings are drawn from the reading list for the ND doctoral exam in sociology of religion, to also help facilitate preparation for that exam."
SOC 63800,"Gender is arguably the most fundamental social division and axis of inequality in human society.  Although gender categories differ cross-culturally, all societies use gender as a key organizing and stratifying principle.  But what exactly is gender and how does it relate to biological sex?  What is the history of gender as a category of analysis in sociology and how have gender scholars influenced other sociological sub-fields?   In this course, we will read foundational tracts on theorizing gender and gendering theory, we will consider feminist methodological critiques, and we will examine empirical manifestations of gender and of gender inequality across varied arenas of social life and sociological research."

During workshop, the author will briefly introduce the paper and outline any questions or concerns in need of group guidance. We welcome scholars whose research has primary or secondary relevance to gender, sexuality, or family. You need not identify as a gender scholar in order to participate. We also welcome researchers who are interested in developing gender as a theme in their research. If you are wondering how gender can be more than a control variable in your analysis, or how to theorize gender in your research context, you would be an excellent fit for the workshop."
SOC 63911,"This course is intended to familiarize graduate students with the content and the method of great written works by sociology's founding theorists. Theorists to be discussed include DuBois, Durkheim, Weber, Marx, and Simmel.  An examination of their writings serves as a basis to analyze the theoretical ambitions and controversies that provided the foundation for the development of sociology and which continue to influence contemporary social science. While giving students an introduction to the foundational thought from which much contemporary sociology continues to draw, the course is also intended to give students a practical introduction to the craft of being a working sociological theorist by exposing students to the varied different ways of generating publishable work in dialogue with the classics, including contemporary extensions, applications, and critiques from a diverse body of perspectives."

STV 10210,"Have you ever pondered how people live(d) in a world without television, YouTube, smartphones, and automobiles? Why have bellbottoms come and gone twice in the last 50 years? Will we be forced to relive the fashion mistakes of the 1970s and 1980s? What new stuff will people invent and sell next? In asking and answering these questions, we must focus on one underlying query: What does our stuff really say about who we are and who we want to be? This course combines lectures, discussions, and interactive small group activities to explore the nature and breadth of peoples' relationships with their things. We will investigate why and how people make and use different types of objects, and how the use of these material goods resonates with peoples' identities in the deep past, recent history, and today. Since everyone in the class will already be an expert user and consumer of things, we will consider how people today use material objects to assert, remake, reclaim, and create identities, and compare today's practices to those of people who lived long ago. Class members will learn about how anthropologists, including ethnographers (studying people today) and archaeologists (studying past peoples) think about and approach the material nature of our social, economic, and political lives. We will discuss why styles and technologies change through time, and why, in the end, there is very little new under the sun in terms of human behaviors and the way people produce and consume goods. The topical breadth of this workshop encompasses most social science disciplines, including history, economics, psychology, and anthropology, and resonates with classics, art history, and gender studies."

This course will examine national security policy: what it is, how it is formulated and executed, and how US national security policies have evolved since the 1890s. Using a variety of readings and films such as Casablanca and Dr. Strangelove, this course will examine US national security policies from the late 1890s through two world wars, the interwar period, the Cold War, the post-Cold War years, and up to the current post-9/11 world. We will identify continuities and departures in historic US national security policies, and consider the roles of policymakers and their critics in a self-governing society. "

This course is jointly taught and sponsored by the Department of Physics and the Department of Political Science."
STV 20102,"This course will introduce students to fundamental ethical and social issues related to the design, development, and use of technology. Students will develop an understanding of philosophical ethical theories as a resource for analyzing how technology impacts both individual and collective civil, political, and human rights and issues related to autonomy, privacy, and identity, as well as how it reinforces power dynamics in society and its impacts on equity, justice, and fairness. Specific topics will include bias and fairness in algorithms, privacy, data governance and civil liberties, surveillance and power, social media, and the ethics of artificial intelligence."
STV 20202,"MATERIALS FEE. Design has come more and more to describe not only the development of objects but the process by which one shapes the interactions and experiences of people with the systems, services and organizations around us. A deeply human-centered approach to problem solving, design thinking is centered around identifying and reframing complex problems, and solving them through a more creative, iterative and hands-on approach. This course will follow a series of overlapping modules that will introduce the student to the various steps employed in the design thinking process and becoming familiar with the tools and methodologies used. The course will feature a hybrid seminar format with lectures and case studies followed by hands-on exercises and practical applications of the theories in the form of team projects. Students will be able to apply this methodology to problems of a variety of disciplines from science and engineering to business and the liberal arts. The course is the gateway for the Collaborative Innovation minor."
STV 20204,"This course introduces students to the field of social-cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropologists are primarily interested in exploring issues of human cultural diversity across cultures and through time. This course will explore key theoretical, topical, and ethical issues of interest to cultural anthropologists. We will examine diverse ways in which people around the globe have constructed social organizations (such as kinship, and political and economic systems) and cultural identities (such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, race, and class) and we will consider the impact of increasing globalization on such processes. Throughout the course we will consider how different anthropologists go about their work as they engage in research and as they represent others through the writing of ethnographies."
STV 20210,"Psychiatry and mental healthcare have been the target of criticism and controversy for decades. Common critiques are that the field is not grounded in medical science, that it pathologizes normal problems in living, or that it is a method of social control. This course will focus on the social movements that have been critical of mental healthcare from the second half of the twentieth century to today. We will begin by considering questions such as: What is the proper role of mental healthcare? What is a social movement? What is the relationship between mental healthcare and politics? Then we will shift to discussing particular social movements including antipsychiatry, Mad Pride, the emergence of the concepts of disability and neurodiversity as alternatives to pathology, and other examples of service-user led activism. The goal of the course will be to better understand the ways that psychiatry has abused it power and imagine changes that could be made to the system to improve the lives of those who suffer from mental health conditions."
STV 20228,"This course explores the ethical challenges posed by the ongoing revolution in the technology of war. After learning about some general, philosophical approaches to ethical decision making, we will examine a wide range of new weapons technologies, from smart bombs, drones, and robots to em (electromagnetic) weapons, cyberwar, and bio-enhancement, asking the question whether the existing framework of Just War Theory and the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) are adequate for war as it will be fought in the 21st century."
STV 20331,"Introduction to Criminology provides students with an overview of the sociological study of law making, law breaking and the resulting social responses. In  this class we not only look at a variety of crimes, but we also discuss the varying methods sociologists use to collect, interpret and evaluate data, as well as how we theorize about crime and punishment. We address questions such as Why are some people or groups labeled as criminal, while others are not? Do laws in both their construction and enforcement serve everyone's interests equally? How can the communities in which people are embedded be considered as criminogenic? How are poverty, race, gender and other social factors related to crime?"
STV 20410,"This course is a comprehensive introduction to the sociology of health and of medicine. First we will examine how sociological variables affect people's health. Research is rapidly accumulating which shows that sociological variables have a huge impact on people's susceptibility to various illnesses, on their access to health care, and on their compliance with medical advice. Such variables include people's neighborhoods, occupations, and lifestyles; their social class, education, race, ethnicity, and gender - and the density of social networks, whose importance for health was predicted by one of sociology's founders over 100 years ago. Second we will examine medicine, both the practice of medicine by individual health care professionals, viewed sociologically, and the operation of the increasingly large and bureaucratic medical institutions in which health care professionals must work. In addition, we will examine sociological issues that overlap medicine, such as radically long shifts; the rapid increase in the proportion of female doctors; and increasing concern with work/family balance among practitioners. Third, we will examine health and medicine in relation to other dimensions of society, such as the modern economy, the media, law, the internet, government and politics. Health and medicine are intrinsically social and they cannot be isolated from the effects of the rest of society, many of which run counter to strictly medical considerations. Finally, we will examine health and medicine globally. We will compare health and medicine in a number of societies to see and explain how they are similar and how they differ - for example, how different societies pay for medical care. And we will examine global trends with implications for health and medicine that require cooperation among societies, such as the way in which global air travel both increases the danger of global pandemics and makes possible medical tourism. "
STV 20556,"Science and technology play a powerful role in structuring our world, in everything from our physical environment to our culture.  It is thus imperative that we understand how these entities work. What constitutes reliable knowledge? How do the technological systems in which we are embedded throughout our lives come to be, and how can they be changed? In this historic moment of a global pandemic playing out against a backdrop of fake news, alternative facts and increasingly autonomous technologies, these questions are more critical than ever.     This course introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of Science and Technology Studies in order to provide them with analytical and conceptual tools needed to confront the complex questions that arise where science and society intersect. Its objective is thus not so much to present a particular body of empirical information as it is to equip students with the analytical skills to understand complex multi-dimensional phenomena. The purpose is to give students both the opportunity and the tools to consider science and technology in a broader political, social, historical and economic context, and to reflect on how the practices of scientific and technological development shape their own individual and collective experience. "
STV 20603,"The goal of the course is to compare the processes by which social scientists and filmmakers/photographers engage in social documentation. Students explore how global social problems such as rural and urban poverty, race and gender inequalities, immigration, and violence are analyzed across the social sciences, and depicted in a variety of documentary film and photography genres. The course also explores the role that documentary photography and film play in promoting rights and advocating for social change, particularly in the realm of human rights and global inequality. It examines the history of documentary film and photography in relationship to politics, and to the development of concerns across the social sciences with inequality and social justice. It also looks at how individual documentarians, non-profit organizations and social movements use film and photography to further their goals and causes, and issues of representation their choices raise.  The course is also unique because it requires students to engage in the process of visual documentation themselves by incorporating an activity-based learning component. For their final project, students choose a human rights or social problem that concerns or interests them (and which they can document locally — no travel is required), prepare a documentary exhibit on the chosen topic (10-12 photographs), and write a 12-15 page paper analyzing how 2-3 social scientists construct and frame the given problem. Students also have the option to produce a short documentary film."
STV 20617,"Scientific theories have enjoyed much success; they afford us tremendous power to predict and explain phenomena in the world around us. In light of this power, you might wonder why it is these theories are so successful. This question invariably leads to others. For instance: how much do our chosen theories tell us about the world---must the unseen entities referenced by scientific explanations exist? And just what counts as a scientific explanation anyhow? This course will equip you with the tools necessary to begin answering these and other questions. We will survey classic and contemporary debates in the philosophy of science, including: the reality of unobservable entities posited by theories; the nature of scientific explanation; how we choose between competing theories; and how we confirm existing theories. We will also consider applications to examples from the physical sciences. However, this course is self-contained: no previous familiarity with any particular physical or mathematical theory is required."
STV 20760,"The Earth's climate is changing faster than expected. Industrialization, fossil fuel use, consumption, and exploitation are radically transforming the planet we live on. In Witnessing Climate Change, we work to make sense of the science behind this planetary crisis and practice writing about it for the public. This is a large, writing-intensive, public-facing course that engages key contemporary issues and core ways of knowing from a values-oriented perspective, through large lectures and small group workshops. Readings include Jeff VanderMeer, Nukariik, Barry Lopez, Aldo Leopold, Wanda Coleman, J.M. Coetzee, and St. Francis, among others."
STV 20806,"We are living through a watershed moment in United States history. Structural racism is at the forefront of the national discourse. Yet, the threat that racism holds on our nation's most cherished ideals of democracy and justice is hardly new. Generations of activists, scholars, and everyday people have fought and persevered to bring about social, cultural, and policy change.  This course engages deeply with topics relevant to the national discourse on racial and ethnic relations in the U.S. The first part of the course examines key concepts, focusing on the social construction of race and ethnicity, prejudice, and discrimination. The second part reviews the historical experiences of Native Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans. The third and final part of the course centers on four critical issues that are especially relevant in 2020: (1) immigration; (2) political disenfranchisement; (3) racial and ethnic disparities in health; and (4) racism in the criminal justice system."
STV 20888,"This course investigates the Christian understanding of creation and how this doctrine relates to contemporary scientific issues. We will examine the development of the doctrine beginning with Scripture and the Creed and progressing through the early Church period into the Medieval and Scholastic era, focusing on the concepts of creation ex nihilo, creation continua, divine Providence, and divine action in the world. With the rise of the modern era, we will analyze the origin of and principles involved with the purported conflict between science and theology. We will bring the doctrine of creation into dialogue with three contemporary issues in the sciences: cosmology, evolution, and ecology. Integral to this course will be the relationship and response of humankind to God and to creation. This course will have a special appeal to students interested in the intersection of science and theology."
STV 20918,"This course is an introduction to the history of the peoples of Africa from the late nineteenth century to the present day. During the term, we will consider the ways in which Africans shaped and were shaped by the transformative events of the period. In the second half of the nineteenth century, European powers conquered and colonized much of the continent. Over the next sixty years, Africans lived and died under the yoke of European rule; some resisted, others collaborated, but all influenced the nature of colonialism and its eventual collapse. By the 1960s, most Africans were free of foreign rule. Since then the peoples of Africa have endeavored to achieve political stability, navigate Cold War politics, harness development aid, and adapt to a globalizing economy. In recent years, they have succumbed to brutal wars and endured devastating famines, but they have also inspired the world with their triumph over apartheid, emerging vibrant democracies, rich cultures, and deep history. In this class, we will identify, problematize, and debate these major themes in Modern African history. We also will make use of a variety of texts, from historical documents to classic academic works to works of African art, film, and fiction."
STV 21203,"This once weekly lab session is a mandatory requirement for students enrolled in the Design Thinking course. These sessions focus on practical application of the topics and materials presented in class with students working in teams to employ techniques and methodology on assigned projects. This hands-on lab will having students exploring the research, brainstorming, ideation, iterative prototyping and presentation techniques that lead to creative innovation and disruptive breakthroughs applicable to students of any discipline."
STV 23202,"Organized violence between human communities is one of the unfortunate realities of human existence, and its causes and consequences have consequently been of great interest. Is war an inevitable outcome of human nature, or the result of specific social, historical, and environmental circumstances? Archaeology is uniquely positioned to provide concrete insights into the history of human violence through study of its direct material correlates, traumatic injuries on skeletons, fortified settlements, weaponry, and iconography. However, the archaeological record also documents the impacts of violence, reduced nutritional status and health, evidence for enslavement, cannibalism, and population decline, and can provide insights into why war occurred through examination of environment, population, and social conditions. In this course, we will explore what the archaeological record tells us about violence, human nature, and the veracity of claims for either a more violent or more peaceful past. We will examine theoretical models of war, anthropological studies of conflict, and archaeological case studies of both violent and peaceful times to understand the role that organized violence has played in human history and evolution."
STV 30055,"This course will provide advanced undergraduates and graduate students with a critical introduction to digital humanities for the study of early China, the fountainhead of Chinese Civilization. Collaborating with the Center of Digital Scholarship, this course will focus on relational data with structured information on historical figures, especially high officials, of early Chinese empires. Throughout the semester, we will read academic articles, mine data from primary sources, and employ Gephi and ArcGIS to visualize data. Those constructed data will cover three major themes: how geographical mobility contributed to consolidating a newly unified empire over diversified regions; how social networks served as the hidden social structure channeling the flow of power and talents; and how criminal records and excavated legal statutes shed light on the unique understanding of law and its relationship with the state in Chinese history."

STV 30106,"This course examines the nineteenth and twentieth century histories of print and cultural manufacturing in the U.S., with special attention given to readers, writers, media producers, and distribution. By tracing how literature, broadly defined, has influenced the shape and reshaping of modern life, our primary goal for the semester will be to better understand the role and impact of intellectual transmission on civil society, formal politics, and cultural standards. Related topics we will investigate include the development and growth of American children's literature; the history of racial and ethnic authorship; the rise of industrial publishing; national and transnational censorship; and legacies of master communicators to mass audiences (e.g. Franklin Roosevelt with radio, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan with television, and Donald Trump with Twitter). Course readings and film screenings will range from William Llloyd Garrison's abolitionist newspaper, The Liberator, Matthew Rubery's The Untold Story of the Talking Book, Catherine Fisk's Writing for Hire: Unions, Hollywood, and Madison Avenue, James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time, Capote, and The Social Network."
STV 30112,"Disability has long been constructed as the opposite of higher education. Universities are places that valorize, even demand, physical and intellectual ability. Disability, in turn, is often seen as something that does not fit within a university context, a problem that must be fixed. This antithetical relationship between disability and the university is rooted in history—eugenical curriculums, research programs that study disabled people—but it continues today. Despite a growing focus on diversity in university admissions and populations, disabled students enter higher education at a lower rate than non-disabled students and are less likely to graduate. In addition, universities perpetuate cultures of ableism in both faculty and students by prioritizing ability, perfection, and achievement."
STV 30145,"This course offers a critical examination of what it means to be an immigrant or child of immigrants through scholarly works, memoirs, blogs, and popular journalism. Since the liberalization of immigration policy in 1965, immigrants from Latin America and Asia are becoming an increasing and emergent demographic of American society. In major American cities such as Los Angeles and New York, they comprise over 50% of the population. This course focuses on how immigrants and the children of immigrants experience the United States. How are immigrants changing the US racial and ethnic structure? How do their experiences differ given varying legal statuses? How is the second generation becoming American? We will explore these questions through readings that focus on family, religion, education, dating and sexuality. This course will include a community based learning component where students will work with immigrant serving organizations. Students will have the option to teach citizenship classes or to work with immigrant children. Service will be 2-3 hours per week outside of class."
STV 30192,"Sports play a big role in American culture. From pick up soccer and the Baraka Bouts to fantasy football and the Olympics, sports articulate American identities, priorities, aspirations, and concerns. They reflect our dominant values but also highlight our divisions and serve as a means to question those values. Athletes, organizers, spectators, fans, and the media all have a stake. This course will examine sport's role in American society and culture thematically, covering the late 19th century to present and paying special attention to sport as a physical performance (including issues of danger, drugs, disability, spectatorship, and fandom), sport as an expression of identity (the construction of race, gender, class, community, and nation), sport as a form of labor (with issues of power and control, safety, and amateurism), and sport as a cultural narrative (how do writers, historians, and the media attach meaning to it?). We will examine history, journalism, documentary film, and television coverage; topics will range from Victorian bicyclists and early college football to Muhammad Ali. Requirements include reading and regular discussion, a variety of short analytical papers, and a culminating project in which students will choose one course theme to analyze through a topic of their own choice."
STV 30200,"What is psychic life? The word psyche has encompassed a range of definitions as it has travelled through time, from notions of mind, soul, spirit, and the conscious and unconscious mind, to a mirror, an asteroid discovered in 1852, a moth or butterfly, and anima mundi, the animating principle of the universe itself. Today an additional constellation of concepts may also be drawn into psyche's orbit, including brain, emotion, feeling, affect, self, subjectivity, person, ego, and experience. As opposed to terms like mental health, the concept of psychic life provides a language with which to speak about a range of phenomena across multiple traditions, epistemologies, and histories, without prioritizing any one conceptualization over another or locating the psyche within the boundaries of an individual mind, as distinct from the body and the world (Eileen Barany, cc:d here, has the full course description if you are interested). "
STV 30210,"This course serves as a gateway for subsequent coursework in international security. It is a required course in the Notre Dame International Security Center's undergraduate certificate program requirements, but it is also appropriate for, and open to, any Notre Dame students interested in U.S. national security policymaking. It will begin with an account of the history and development of U.S. national security policy from the Founding through the present. Next, it examines the current state of the primary institutions involved in U.S. national security policymaking. Finally, it explores the tools and instruments of military statecraft as applied by the United States. The course culminates with a simulation exercise in which students will role-play key participants in the U.S. national security policymaking process. At a minimum, that students will gain from it the analytical tools, historical knowledge, and current-events background to become more informed citizens, particularly with respect to important national debates about when and how our country should use military force. At a maximum, the course may lead some students to become interested enough in the topic to pursue a career in either the practice or the study of U.S. national security policy.

STV 30242,"This course examines how oil and natural gas have shaped international relations from the early twentieth century to the present, with a particular focus on conflict.  It begins by introducing students to the fundamentals of global energy production, consumption and trade, and then briefly surveys the political history of oil as it relates to the great powers.  The course then moves on to contemporary issues, including the political significance of fracking technology, the role of the United States in protecting Persian Gulf oil, and the extent to which Russia's dominant natural gas position might translate into political influence in Europe.  These and other topics are examined through numerous theoretical lenses, including theories of resource conflict, economic interdependence, political coercion, and petro-aggression."
STV 30300,"The focus of the course will be an examination of the advances in medicine over the last 30 years that have challenged traditional values and ethical norms, and the institutional processes and procedures in place that facilitate decision-making in the health care setting. It will include a sketch of the most recent advances in the various fields of medicine, followed by an examination of the clinical and ethical questions they raise and how they have affected the physician-patient relationship.  "
STV 30307,"The goal of the course is to compare the processes by which social scientists and filmmakers/photographers engage in social documentation. Students explore how global social problems such as rural and urban poverty, race and gender inequalities, immigration, and violence are analyzed across the social sciences and depicted in a variety of documentary film and photography genres. The course also explores the role that documentary photography and film play in promoting rights and advocating for social change, particularly in the realm of human rights and global inequality. It examines the history of documentary film and photography in relationship to politics and the development of concerns across the social sciences with inequality and social justice. It also looks at how individual documentarians, non-profit organizations, and social movements use film and photography to further their goals and causes as well as issues of representation their choices raise. The course is unique because it requires students to engage in the process of visual documentation themselves by incorporating an activity-based learning component. For their final project, students choose a human rights or social problem that concerns or interests them (and which they can document locally - no travel is required), prepare a documentary exhibit on the chosen topic (10-12 photographs), and write an essay analyzing how social scientists construct and frame the given problem. Students also have the option to produce a short documentary film"
STV 30320,"This course will examine the representation of medicine in film, still art and texts.  The point of view will be to examine the interdisciplinary arts, primarily film plus secondary readings of literary texts, with the goal of broadening the understanding of the lives of patients, families and providers for future health care professionals, particularly physicians.  The goal is to heighten the awareness of the world surrounding medical encounters and encourage an open minded approach to people in medical need. Based on Cinemeducation training in medical schools  and residency programs, topics examined include delivering bad news, end of life issues, medical malpractice, family dynamics, professionalism, cultural diversity, gender issues, grief, balance of professional and personal life and medical errors.  Film clips will be introduced and reviewed with specific discussion points. Strong emphasis will be placed on group discussion, with four short papers, one discussion lead and a final paper."
STV 30325,"Plants have provided food, medicine, fuel, and raw materials for humans throughout our history. Concurrently, humans have modified the distribution, diversity and utility of plants for our benefit in ways that are often unsustainable. Many of the grand environmental and societal challenges of today and tomorrow involve our interactions with plants and the pivotal roles they play in our natural and modified environments. The goal of this course is to provide foundational knowledge about the biology and diversity of plants. This includes learning the basics of plant anatomy and physiology and the ecology and evolutionary history of plants. This knowledge is then utilized to discuss plants as sources of food, commercial products, medicines and toxins in the past, present and future of human society."
STV 30330,"The study of religious beliefs and practices in tribal and peasant societies emphasizing myths, ritual, symbolism, and magic as ways of explaining man's place in the universe. Concepts of purity and pollution, the sacred and the profane, and types of ritual specialists and their relation to social structure will also be examined."
STV 30333,"This course offers an in-depth examination of one of the 's most popular media: Japanese animation.  Students will study the development of the anime industry and the artistic styles used in anime with an eye toward understanding how this supposedly unique form of art in fact responds to and affects global events and art forms.

While designed specifically for the future medical professional, the course is open as enrollment allows to students in allied helping professions.  Class material will include research from medical, psychological, caring science, business, and spiritual sources."
STV 30407,"The Second World War is the largest single event in human history, fought across six of the world's seven continents and all its oceans. It killed fifty million human beings, left hundreds of millions of others wounded in mind or body and materially devastated much of the heartland of civilization. The above quote from historian John Keegan summarizes the significance of studying the Second World War. In this class, students will receive an introduction to the largest conflict in human history, from the origins of the war in Asia and Europe to the postwar settlements that continue to shape the modern world. Class content will focus on the military, diplomatic, and political narratives of the war, while exploring the lived experience of the war through primary source readings. This course satisfies the university history requirement and is open to all students; no previous knowledge of the topic is required."
STV 30454,"The French Revolution, along with the American Revolution, is often considered the founding moment of modern democracy. And yet, democracy was not achieved once and for all in 1789. Over the course of the next two hundred years, France went through five republics, two empires, two monarchies, and one (arguably) fascist regime. In addition, it took hundreds of years for the egalitarian promises of the revolution to be extended to all members of French society. This course tells the story of this ongoing experiment in democratic governance—one that continues to this day. It introduces students to the major themes in the political and cultural history of modern France from 1789 to the present, examining how the universalist promise of the Republic has been contested and reshaped through its encounter with colonialism, industrialization, the rise of radical ideologies, religion, war, feminism, and multiculturalism. Course materials are drawn from a variety of sources, including novels, manifestos, political cartoons, films, works of art and philosophy, as well as secondary works by historians."
STV 30461," Television has been widely available in the United States for only half a century, yet aleady it has become a key means through which we understand our culture. Our course examines this vital medium from three perspectives. First, we will look at the industrial, economic and technological forces that have shaped U.S. television since its inception. These factors help explain how U.S. television adopted the format of advertiser-supported broadcast networks and why this format is changing today. Second, we will explore television's role in American social and political life: how TV has represented cultural changes in the areas of gender, class, race and ethnicity. Third, we will discuss specific narrative and visual strategies that characterize program formats. Throughout the semester we will demonstrate how television and U.S. culture mutually influence one another, as television both constructs our view of the world and is affected by social and cultural forces within the U.S.  "
STV 30524,"Since the eighteenth century, Europeans have grappled with a number of transformative events and developments, from the French Revolution and the birth of an industrial economy, to catastrophic wars and the rise and fall of European empires. In the process of making sense of these events, they produced works of philosophy, political theory, art, and literature that continue to shape the way we understand our place in the world today. This course introduces students to the history of European thought from the Enlightenment to the present, a period that birthed the many great isms that have defined the modern world: liberalism, socialism, nationalism, feminism, existentialism, totalitarianism, and colonialism. Course readings will be drawn from a range of primary sources, including novels, works of philosophy, political treatises, films, and works of art, as well as secondary sources by historians. By reading these two kinds of sources together, we will explore not only how ideas and works of art were shaped by the historical context in which they were produced, but also how they themselves shaped the course of European history."
STV 30532,"An introduction to the economics of housing, with particular attention to issues of homelessness and the low-income housing market. Topics includes economic models of homelessness, housing subsidies and regulations, housing market filtering, concentrated poverty and neighborhoods effects, and public policy responses to housing problems."
STV 30543,"This course examines the late 20th and early 21st century 'economic miracles' of several East Asian countries and the political, social, and spatial factors underpinning them. We will explore similarities, differences, and interdependencies in the development trajectories of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and mainland China, and will debate how accurate and useful concepts like the developmental state and state capitalism are in describing the political economy of the region. To what extent has China's economic rise followed the existing playbooks of its East Asian neighbors? What human costs and developmental distortions have accompanied booming industrial and urban growth? And what lessons does East Asia's experience offer for the contemporary developing world?"
STV 30553,"Social Entrepreneurship has sparked dialogue and debate for two decades. Its very definition is much debated, as well as its capacity to create sustainable, scalable, systems-changing impact. This course explores the theoretical concepts, practices and strategies associated with the dynamic discipline of social enterprise and innovation. For our purposes, social entrepreneurship is the landscape, of which paradigm-shifting solutions like microfinance, MSME (Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise) development, bottom of the pyramid, fair trade, impact investing, and the like, are components. This course will study many of these concepts, focusing on their opportunity for social impact, and as a vehicle for wealth creation in vulnerable and disenfranchised communities across the globe. Further, the course covers examples of various social enterprise models (for-profit, non-profit, hybrid), requiring students to analyze and devise strategies to improve the efficacy of these ventures. Finally, the course engages students in research seeking to advance the field of social entrepreneurship at the Keough School of Global Affairs and Notre Dame."
STV 30555,"Do you want to learn how to solve problems that matter? Human Centered Design (HCD) is an empathetic tool that utilizes guided questioning related to product, service, or systems innovations to identify opportunities for sustainable, human-centered impact. For example, how might we design a cookstove that reduces the amount of smoke inhaled by a community member? How might we design a new service engaging low-income borrowers in rural communities? How might we design a system linking social innovators and their innovations to users across the globe in a manner that encourages collaboration and sharing of resources? Whether a social innovator is designing in the private, public or nonprofit sector, HCD provides a valuable framework, deeply rooted in empathy, and is an excellent methodology for social innovators who want to problem solve and design alongside communities. In this course students will be introduced to the HCD toolkit and will apply it in practice, either in a domestic or international context. This fast-paced course will take students through the HCD cycles of inspiration, ideation and implementation, and provide opportunities for student and community collaboration."
STV 30558,"This course is designed to introduce students to a wide range of health issues affecting women globally, with particular emphasis on Africa, Asia, and the United States. The topics will focus on a woman's life, from infancy and childhood, through adolescence and reproductive years, to old age. We will examine the physiological, social, psychological, economic, cultural, political, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence women's health, and the role of poverty, discrimination, and unequal health access. Topics such as determinants of womenand#39;s health, reproductive health, sexual health, cardiovascular health, maternal health, cancers of the reproductive tract, mental and emotional health, substance use and abuse, and various forms of violence against women will be discussed. At the end of the course, students should have a solid grasp of key issues affecting the health of women in different cultural contexts globally, and how women can be empowered to take actions that positively influence their health."
STV 30565,"This course examines how economic analysis can be applied to various components of the health care system. Microeconomic theory is used to understand the operation of health care markets and the behavior of participants (consumers, insurers, physicians, and hospitals) in the health care industry. International comparisons and the role of the public sector are discussed."
STV 30605,"This course focuses on selected legal and policy issues related to K-12 education in the United States. A central theme is the intersection of K-12 schooling and the state, with a particular focus on Constitutional issues of religious freedom and establishment, student speech and privacy, parental choice, educational opportunity, and education reform trends such as charter schools and accountability measures. Questions examined over the course of the semester include: What are the most basic obligations of the state with regard to its regulation of K-12 education? What are the most basic rights of parents in this regard? In what ways does the 1st Amendment protect - and limit - the speech and privacy rights of K-12 schoolchildren? In what ways may the state accommodate K-12 schools with an explicitly religious character? What are the Constitutional requirements with regard to religious speech or expression within K-12 public schools? To what degree is the principle of equality manifest in the form of educational opportunity? How has this changed over time? In what ways have education reform trends such as charter schooling and increased accountability changed the policy landscape of K-12 education?"
STV 30634,"This course gives students the opportunity to learn more about how Americans have thought about criminal responsibility and how their ideas have changed over time. Historians contend that the 19th century witnessed a transformation in the understanding of the origins of criminal behavior in the United States. The earlier religious emphasis on the sinfulness of all mankind, which made the murderer into merely another sinner, gave way to a belief in the inherent goodness of humankind. But if humans were naturally good, how are we to explain their evil actions? And crime rates varied widely by sex and race; European women were said to have been domesticated out of crime doing. What do those variations tell us about a common human nature? The criminal might be a flawed specimen of humankind born lacking a healthy and sane mind. Relying in part upon studies done in Europe, American doctors, preachers, and lawyers debated whether insanity explained criminality over the century and how it expressed itself in different races and sexes. Alternative theories were offered. Environment, heredity, and free will were all said to have determined the actions of the criminal. By the early 20th century, lawyers and doctors had largely succeeded in medicalizing criminality. Psychiatrists now treated criminals as patients; judges invoked hereditary eugenics in sentencing criminals. Science, not sin, had apparently become the preferred mode of explanation for the origins of crime. But was this a better explanation than what had come before? Can it explain the turbulent debates in the late 20th and early 21st Centuries over variations in crime rates by race? Can it explain why men, not women, are still more likely to commit murder?"
STV 30635,"Alcohol Use Disorder is a chronic relapsing brain disease. But when presented on screen, it's entertainment. Why do we laugh, why do we cry, why do we emulate fictional characters whose drinking habits result in a life of debilitating addiction? From Humphrey Bogart to Ron Burgundy the psychology and seduction of alcohol on film, in television, and laptops will be analyzed. Furthermore, what is the relationship between the manner in which alcohol use/abuse is presented on screen and the manner in which alcohol is used and abused on, for example, college campuses? Surveying film and television history, we will examine how alcohol is used in story structure, as a character flaw or strength, and as a narrative device in the story arc of films across multiple film genres, (action/adventure, comedy, romance, etc). Why do characters drink, where do they drink, and how does the result of their getting drunk advance the narrative? We'll also look at non-fiction films that tackle issues of addiction, as a way of comparing character development in Hollywood films to the results of this same behavior in everyday life. Film materials will include weekly screenings outside of class, and academic articles relating to portrayal and analysis of alcohol use in film and television, including the business of marketing campaigns, product placement, and box office results. From the psychological perspective we will discuss the topic and process of social influence and how the presence of others influences our behavior. Questions of interest will include the following: what are the mechanisms by which group influence unfolds? How and why might we be persuaded? Does the manner, and if so how, in which alcohol use is portrayed in movies and the media reflect the processes and principles of social influence? Readings will include chapters on social influence, persuasion and academic articles evaluating the manner in which alcohol is portrayed and advertised and the effect this has on alcohol consumption. In addition, issues of addiction will be discussed - from understanding the basis of addiction to examining the efficacy of addiction treatment."
STV 30750,"Generative AI is a form of computing in which computer systems generate media such as text, images, sound, video, or combinations based on prompts or other information provided to the computer. These systems, including, but are not limited to, ChatGPT, Midjourney and DALLE, have been evolving rapidly and have led to extreme excitement, confusion, and fear. This course provides a survey of how to understand and use a number of these tools including explorations in prompt engineering as well as addressing issues from across the liberal arts including artistic, economic, social/psychological, educational and legal concerns and opportunities."
STV 30835,"The course adopts an entrepreneurial perspective in exploring the role of business in helping to address the poverty challenge in developing and developed economies. The multi-faceted nature of poverty and its implications when it comes to business and entrepreneurship are explored. Attention is devoted to venture creation as a pathway out of poverty, and to how the larger business community can be leveraged in poverty alleviation efforts. Students will examine case studies and meet low income entrepreneurs."
STV 30900,"Sociological theory is the foundation of sociology. Students in this course will learn two things: first, what theorists do and why and, second, how to use fundamental theoretic concepts - such as exploitation and alienation, social structure and solidarity, bureaucracy and charisma - to analyze and explain contemporary society."
STV 30902,"Sociology 30902 is designed to provide an overview of research methods in the social sciences. Topics covered include (1) hypothesis formulation and theory construction; (2) the measurement of sociological variables; and (3) data collection techniques - experimental, survey, and observational. At the end of the course, students should appreciate both the strengths and the limitations of sociological research methods."
STV 30910,"The aim of this class is to try to understand what conquest, as we have traditionally called it, meant to the people who experienced it in some parts of the Americas that joined the Spanish monarchy in the sixteenth century. We'll concentrate on indigenous sources - documentary, pictorial, and material - and try to adopt the indigenous point of view, without neglecting sources mediated by Europeans. Although the class will concentrate on selected cases from Mesoamerica, the lecturer will try to set the materials in the context of other encounters, both within the Americas and further afield; and students will be free, if they wish, to explore case-studies from anywhere they choose in the Americas (in consultation with the lecturer and subject to his approval) in their individual projects."
STV 30950,"The difference between rich and poor nations is not, as Ernest Hemingway once said, that the rich have more money than the poor, but is in part because the rich produce more goods and services. Industrialization, in other words, has often brought wealth (as well as social dislocation and protest) to those who have succeeded. This course examines the process of industrialization from a comparative perspective and integrates the history of industrialization and its social consequences for Western Europe (Britain and Germany), the United States, Latin America (Mexico), and East Asia (Japan and South Korea). We will concentrate on these countries' transition from agriculture-based societies to industrial societies. We will analyze the process of industrialization on two levels from above the role of political authority and from below a view of factory life, industrial relations, and protest from the perspective of workers and the working classes. No specific prerequisites in history or economics are necessary."
STV 33310,"This course explores the interaction of thinking and action for justice, of cognitive science and social change. In this contested moment, how might we examine the ideas with which we think as we envision social transformation and work toward solidarity and the common good? We will draw from psychology and neuroscience to understand how to overcome attribution errors, implicit bias, and motivated reasoning in work to promote justice. We will examine how assumptions about knowledge and our theories of mind impact our communication and work, and explore epistemic justice (who is invited to the table of knowledge). We will explore, in seminar format, means to promote intellectual humility, ethical imagination, practical wisdom, and commitment to action. Students will be encouraged to learn through experience and community engagement, and apply the lessons of the course in their own journeys."
STV 33311,"This course will draw from multiple perspectives to foster a deep appreciation of human development and flourishing. Human development is complex and fragile, yet many splendored. Assumptions about human nature and capacities have critical and moral implications for how we create institutions (family life, education) and systems (policy, government). e challenge is to develop an integrated and ecological understanding of development in the context of human flourishing. We will begin with research in positive psychology on human development, considering the growth of reasoning, identity, moral imagination, and behavior. We will broaden the frame to include understanding of human capabilities from the perspectives of faith (including the principles of Catholic social teaching), culture, and work. Students interested in social change will benefit from a deeper understanding of human development and related research, discussed in a seminar format. Students will draw from their own developmental journeys and current engagements while exploring means to foster human flourishing in future contexts."
STV 33958,"This one-credit, interdisciplinary course is an exploration of the question: What is the relationship between healthy, sustainable communities and the principle of the Common Good? Beginning with an introduction to basic principles of environmental justice, students will explore how the equitable and culturally appropriate distribution of environmental benefits and burdens serves the aim of community health and the common good. Reflective conversations and community visits will shape how students engage questions about the links between health disparities and disproportionate exposure to environmental pollution. Students will leave this course with a foundation of knowledge to address issues at the intersection of health, poverty, sustainability, and justice. Please note: This course satisfies the pre-requisite requirements for any of the Washington Policy Seminars."
STV 40221,"Almost all crimes, or even human interactions, contain a digital component. The fact that old laws don't always fit new problems is no more apparent than in the area of cybercrimes. This course will include discussion of topics including: the methodology of typical cyber investigations, the application of the Fourth Amendment to digital evidence, and different types of cyber-specific laws enforced today. The course will also focus on the responses of both courts and legislators to the ever-evolving issues presented by computer crimes."
STV 40313,"This course provides grounding in some of the methods of qualitative analysis present in the field of anthropology. The focus of the course is on developing skills that students can use to do systematic analysis of anthropological data. The perspective guiding the course is that anthropology is an empirical, scientific approach for describing social and cultural aspects of human life, and that qualitative data can be analyzed in systematic and rigorous ways. The course will explore a range of approaches and will cover analytic skills that cut across traditions, including theme identification, code definition, and pattern recognition. Advanced topics covered will include content analysis, text analysis, and schema analysis. Students will learn techniques and protocols in data arrangement and visualization that are appropriate for different analytical methods. It is a hands-on class where students will be able to work on data provided to them as well as on their own. Collaboration will be integral to the course success."
STV 40405,"How does the global south figure in writing on climate change? Can there be a role for the global south in the climate justice conversation that recognizes its vulnerability to climate change but goes beyond portraying it as always and only vulnerable and devasted or menacing? In this class we will begin with the premise that the answer is yes: not only is such a role possible, but it must actively be created if the climate justice conversation is to be an equal and inclusive one. Anchored in representations of climate refugees, extreme weather events, particular geographies and conflicts, and informed by scholarship on racialized constructions of ‘good' and ‘bad' migrants, this class will collectively work through the intersections between the political and ecological that contour the realities, as well as representations of human movement today. Our collective endeavor will be to (i) understand and critique existing writing on climate change, (ii) recognize and question the role of the global south in such writing and (iii) craft a new lexicon that is cognizant of colonial pasts and their continuity, and relates geographies, histories and politics."
STV 40698,"This seminar examines a number of important topics in medicine and society today, including shared health responsibility, race and class-based inequities, vaccinations, opioid crisis, beginning and end-of-life care, organ donation and body modification, health of imprisoned populations, mental health of healthcare providers, and health in the age of social media. Students in this class will gain an understanding of the ethical, social, and practical dimensions of a variety of healthcare and health policy issues and how providers navigate these dimensions in their care. A key part of the class is the opportunity for students to engage directly with healthcare workers who will serve as guest speakers. The seminar will emphasize writing and journaling, and will directly integrate matters of health care with broader humanistic and social science approaches to health, wellbeing, the body, etc. to deepen students' understandings of what medicine is. This is a core course in the Health, Humanities, and Society minor."
STV 40889,"Our species is unique because it is the only species that deliberately buries its dead. Mortuary analysis (the study of burial patterns) is a powerful approach that archaeologists use for the study of prehistoric social organization and ideology. This course explores the significance of prehistoric human mortuary behavior, from the first evidence of deliberate burial by Neanderthals as an indicator of the evolution of symbolic thought, to the analysis of the sometimes spectacular burial patterns found in complex societies such as ancient Egypt and Megalithic Europe. We will also examine the theoretical and practical aspects of the archaeology of death, including the applications of various techniques ranging from statistics to ethnography, and the legal and ethical issues associated with the excavation and scientific study of human remains."
STV 40999,"Students, in a structured format, are involved in assessing, prioritizing and creatively solving problems encountered by low-income and other disadvantaged South Bend entrepreneurs. A process consulting approach is employed and a number of useful tools and frameworks are introduced. Students work with both for-profit and non-profit enterprises, producing tangible deliverables that help clients launch, grow and sustain their ventures. In addition to class time, students will meet with clients on a weekly basis at a Notre Dame facility located downtown. Assistance with transportation will be available for students needing it. Class will meet on Tuesdays. On Thursdays, students will consult with local entrepreneurs in one hour blocks during the hours of 5p to 9p at the Center for Civic Innovation.

In this course, we'll focus on the relationship that has done most to change human self-perceptions. With a focus on Western texts and experiences, but with reference to many other cultures, we'll focus on the problems of how and why human attitudes to other apes have changed since the Middle Ages, and how they have influenced thinking in science, religion, politics, sociology, literature, and ethics."
STV 43404,"In this course we plunge into the intersection of the subjective, social, and biological as we inquire into anthropological approaches to the nature of our very being. Drawing on insights from psychological, cultural, linguistic, and biological anthropology, as well as other relevant fields (and sometimes literary and other sources), we aim to ask researchable questions and generate theoretical contributions. Students should bring a healthy disposition toward intellectual adventure to class. "
STV 43579,"One would think that secrets are hard to keep, and lies hard to maintain, because it doesn't take much for the truth to escape and once it's out, it can't be put back into the bottle. Yet secrets and lies reside at the heart of much social and political order, sometimes for years and even decades at a time. The objective of this course is to advance our scientific understanding of how this is possible, drawing on sociological, psychological, and historical research on such things as performance, secrecy, lying, forgetting, doubt, denial, and inattention. Case studies will include instances of corporate malfeasance (such as Ponzi schemes and insider trading), Big Tobacco's cover-up of the health consequences of smoking, the lies told by the totalitarian regime of North Korea, the secret British program to break the German cipher during WWII, elaborate attempts to cover up government atrocities, and the cat-and-mouse game between international inspectors and regimes thought to be developing banned weapons. Throughout, we will be concerned with the distinct methodological challenges of studying things many people want to keep secret. Requirements will include midterm and final examinations, reading quizzes/reaction papers, participation, and a final research paper."

STV 43903,"This course examines a range of metaphysical, ethical, and social questions about artificial intelligence. Questions to be addressed include: Could a computer be conscious? Is there anything the human mind can do that a machine couldn't be programmed to do? What are the similarities and differences between human and artificial intelligence? What are the likely cultural and economic effects of AI? What moral principles should guide our use of AI? Is it likely that we'll create AGI (artificial general intelligence), and would this pose an existential threat to humanity?"
STV 43990,"Social networks are an increasingly important form of social organization. Social networks help to link persons with friends, families, co-workers and formal organizations. Via social networks information flows, support is given and received, trust is built, resources are exchanged, and interpersonal influence is exerted. Rather than being static, social networks are dynamic entities. They change as people form and dissolve social ties to others during the life course. Social networks have always been an important part of social life: in our kinship relations, our friendships, at work, in business, in our communities and voluntary associations, in politics, in schools, and in markets. Our awareness of and ability to study social networks has increased dramatically with the advent of social media and new communication tools through which people interact with others. Through email, texting, Facebook, Twitter and other platforms, people connect and communicate with others and leave behind traces of those interactions. This provides a rich source of data that we can use to better understand our connections to each other; how these connections vary across persons and change over time; and the impact that they have on our behaviors, attitudes, and tastes. This course will introduce students to (1) important substantive issues about, and empirical research on, social networks; (2) theories about network evolution and network effects on behavior; and (3) tools and methods that students can use to look at and analyze social networks. The course will be a combination of lectures, discussions and labs. Course readings will include substantive research studies, theoretical writings, and methodological texts. Through this course students will learn about social networks by collecting data on social networks and analyzing that data."

STV 60100,"The science we produce helps us understand the world. But how does the world around us impact how we produce and understand science? Whatever our social lives outside of the lab, in the laboratory workspace, we consider our work to be largely devoid of bias and influence from the outside world. However, the science we encounter is a product of the scientists who have gathered this knowledge - the answer to the “why” depends on “who” came up with it. The goal of this course is to consider “who”, “what”, “when”, and “where” as important questions that affect the scientist, the science they produce, and the way this science is introduced to society. We will be reading scientific literature alongside texts from the discipline of science and technology studies, focusing on the language used by science. Specifically, we will work together to uncover the history and context surrounding commonly used metaphors and critically analyze them through the lenses of race, gender, disability, and indigeneity. We will think about how these word choices impact our scientific hypotheses and interpretations, and sometimes even determines who gets to ask."

This class will also address the environmental and social consequences of industrial farming and public health impacts of quality food accessibility in communities."
SUS 20203,"Design is a profoundly humanistic endeavor, and something that people of all walks of life employ in their work, environment and daily life. To design is, in the words of Herbert Simon, to change existing situations into preferred ones. While design has traditionally referenced the visual aesthetic of much of the world around us, from products and websites to fashion and interiors, more recently it has come to describe the creation and development of services, strategies and systems. More verb than noun, design has evolved into a creative process for identifying compelling problems and providing meaningful solutions. The challenges facing businesses, organizations and society have grown increasingly complex, multi0faceted and ambiguous. And Design Thinking as it is referred to, has emerged as a powerful methodology for addressing wicked challenges in business, social and cultural arenas. Its approach is rooted in a deep sensitivity to human need. Mediating the complex relationship between humans and the built environment, the various design-based methods generate insights and inspire solutions that lead to more meaningful and valued interactions. Design thinking is an iterative process of discovery, ideation and experimentation in order to identify both problems and opportunities and generate innovate solutions that resonate with people and their authentic lived experience. Rather than a linear process though, these stages are best seen as overlapping spaces that ones continuously loops back and forth through en route to a final solution. As a unique hybrid course, students will familiarize themselves with the design thinker's toolkit through readings, discussions and short exercises, all the while deploying these methods and techniques on a series of hands-on collaborative small group projects of longer duration during the D Think Lab Monday sessions. This course is intended for undergraduate students of any discipline interested in learning how the methodology and tools of design  thinking can ignite innovation and address problems and challenges across the spectrum. There are no pre- requisites for the course."
SUS 20300,"This is a field-based course that explores the rich biodiversity of plant life in northern Indiana. Through hands-on experience in a diverse array of field sites, you will be introduced to various plant communities and learn to identify the plants within them.   Plant communities and species distributions reflect patterns and processes as ancient as plate tectonics and as recent as glaciers and European settlement. They reflect the influence of temperature and moisture patterns as well as competition within and among plant species. They are shaped by interactions with animals, insects, and disease, as well as the actions of humans.  Plants are the foundation of every terrestrial habitat, but are often overlooked. By developing a greater familiarity with plant communities and skills for identification, you will be better prepared to appreciate natural habitats, participate in conservation work, and conduct field research."

It begins by introducing students to the fundamentals of global energy production, consumption and trade, and then briefly surveys the political history of oil as it relates to the great powers.  The course then moves on to contemporary issues, including the political significance of fracking technology, the role of the United States in protecting Persian Gulf oil, and the extent to which Russia's dominant natural gas position might translate into political influence in Europe.  These and other topics are examined through numerous theoretical lenses, including theories of resource conflict, economic interdependence, political coercion, and petro-aggression."
SUS 30592,"This course seeks to explore connections between environment and culture change by introducing students to the diversity of cultures living in the Southwest. We begin by learning about indigenous people living in the Southwest today including the Pueblo peoples (e.g., Hopi, Zuni, Santa Clara, Cochiti, Acoma), Navajo, and Tohono O'odham using ethnography and contemporary native histories. We will then travel back in time to learn about the complex histories of these people, particularly the pueblos in places like Chaco Canyon, Mesa Verde, the Rio Grande, the Mimbres Valley, and the Phoenix Basin. Our explorations will cover from the earliest Paleoindians (11,500 years ago) to European contact, the establishment of Spanish Missions, and the Pueblo Revolt of 1680-1692 and then bring this discussion to today. Along the way, we will explore the impact of large-scale, long-term processes such as the adoption of agriculture, village formation, religious change, migration, and warfare on the rich historical landscape of the Southwest."

TEC 20112,"This course introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of Science Studies, which analyzes scientific practice in its wider historical, social, and political context, and aims to provide the analytical and conceptual tools needed to navigate complex questions at the intersection of science and society. Specifically, our thematic focus will be the nature of scientific expertise and the relationship between technical experts and laypersons in contemporary democracy. As our entry point into this topic, we will explore the causes and resolution of disagreements between scientists in order to (1) understand why experts come to disagree, (2) gain a more nuanced picture of the everyday practice of science, including the presence of disagreement as an essential part of the production of reliable scientific knowledge, and (3) consider how engagement with science studies can help laypersons better evaluate technoscientific matters on which expert opinion diverges, without succumbing to distrust or denialism. Drawing on readings from the history, philosophy, and sociology of science, we will first consider potential sources of disagreement. Then, we will analyze a variety of case studies of scientific disagreement drawn from across the experimental and historical sciences, including the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction event (or, what really killed the dinosaurs?), John Snow and the cholera epidemic of 1854, spontaneous generation, and the (first) detection of gravitational waves.

TEC 23201,"Science and technology play a powerful role in structuring our world, in everything from our physical environment to our culture. It is thus imperative that we understand how these entities work. What constitutes reliable knowledge? How do the technological systems in which we are embedded throughout our lives come to be, and how can they be changed? In this historic moment of a global pandemic playing out against a backdrop of fake news, alternative facts and increasingly autonomous technologies, these questions are more critical than ever. This course introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of Science and Technology Studies in order to provide them with analytical and conceptual tools needed to confront the complex questions that arise where science and society intersect. Its objective is thus not so much to present a particular body of empirical information as it is to equip students with the analytical skills to understand complex multi-dimensional phenomena. The purpose is to give students both the opportunity and the tools to consider science and technology in a broader political, social, historical and economic context, and to reflect on how the practices of scientific and technological development shape their own individual and collective experience."
TEC 30114,"As artificial intelligence (AI) grows increasingly pervasive in society, it is essential that we develop an understanding of how AI systems work. A vital part of this understanding is a careful consideration of various risks (e.g., the presence of bias, a lack of transparency, regulatory compliance) when AI systems are designed and deployed in real-world settings.    To understand and address these concerns, this course introduces students to the fundamentals of AI auditing — the practice of evaluating and improving the ethics of AI systems. Through a combination of interactive discussions and semi-technical lab sessions, students will develop an auditing “toolkit”. This toolkit includes both theoretical and technical concepts, especially relevant for the increasingly interdisciplinary teams of the modern workforce. Students will work on group case assignments as “audit committees” that reflect the needs of a variety of stakeholders (e.g., developers, managers, investors, users). Groups will identify and discuss potential concerns or risks associated with AI systems as well as develop recommendations to address them.   Overall, the course aims to provide an interdisciplinary and hands-on introduction to AI auditing, allowing students to gain insights into the opportunities and challenges associated with the design and deployment of AI systems that minimize societal risk and increase their effectiveness.

The course provides an overview of the variety of Eastern-rite Churches belonging to the different cultural traditions of Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. The students will be introduced to the theological views and liturgical life of Eastern-rite Christians, i.e., Orthodox, Oriental and Eastern Catholic, and their fascinating history. We shall explore the Byzantine rite Churches in more detail, and discuss the challenges their theology and history present to contemporary world and international relations. Special attention will be given to Slavic Christianity and particularly to religious history of Ukraine and of Russia. Reflections on the diversity of Christian traditions lead to important insights into theological topics of central importance for today such as theology of history, theology of culture, theology of art, ecclesiology, and sacramental theology."

Accounts of violent warfare in the Old Testament led the Manichaeans and the Marcionites to reject the Old Testament and its God and to deny the holiness of Jewish patriarchs (Abraham, Jacob, Moses), prophets, and kings (David). Defending the unity of the Bible as the inspired Word of God, Saint Augustine defended the holiness of Old Testament battle-leaders and laid the foundation for a â€œJust Warâ€ theory. Many Christian saints (Martin of Tours, Christopher, Guthlac, Francis of Assisi) became hermits and ascetics after quitting military service, turning battle against the enemy into a discipline of struggle against the devil and his temptations. Some former soldiers (e.g., Saint Ignatius of Loyola) adopted military discipline, language, and images in their striving for holiness. Saint Bernard of Clairvaux taught that Christian knighthood and the Crusades could be paths to sainthood, even as he warned against the spiritual dangers of warfare. Saints Joan of Arc and Saint George were warrior saints and are invoked by soldiers. In modern times, reflection on warfare has inspired extraordinary writings by mystically gifted souls (e.g., Teilhard de Chardinâ€™s Mass on the Altar of the World, Simone Weilâ€™s Iliad, Poem of Force) who served in war zones. Other saints, martyrs, and mystics (Dorothy Day, Franz Jagerstaetter, Franz Reinisch) have, however, refused military service as idolatrous. The Churchâ€™s social teaching constantly proclaims the call to peace and peacemaking, the possibility of conscientious objection, and the criteria for just and unjust war. This course seeks to understand the diversity of saintly decisions and practices and to discern their faithfulness to Christian doctrine."
THEO 20424,"Holy Communion is a sign of Christian unity as well as the presence of Christ with his people. Since the Reformation, however, communion has become a sign and instrument of disunity between Christians of different denominations because of different doctrines and ways of celebrating. This course will begin by looking at eucharistic dialogue between different churches today, and then examine the development of communion through church history, including disputes over how the Eucharist should be celebrated and received, questions of Christ's presence in the Eucharist, and the idea that the Eucharist is a sacrifice."
THEO 20425,"This course introduces students to the study of theology through attention to the sacrament of marriage. The structure of the course, drawn from the rite of marriage, seeks to understand the nature of divine and human love and how this love is salvific for the human person. The course will introduce students to major sources for a Christian understanding of love through attention to philosophy, works of cultural analysis, and theological classics related to marriage and family life. The class will treat themes related to a natural theology of love; the understanding of God as lover within the Scriptures and the Tradition; sexual ethics and a theology of family life; and, a spirituality of marriage and the family in the modern age."
THEO 20429,"An examination of the role and representation of women in Christian texts and practices from the biblical period, through late antiquity and the middle ages, into the present. This course employs a variety of methods (theological, historical, socio-cultural, art historical) to explore diverse histories of women, such as female biblical figures, late antique women martyrs and monastics, medieval mystics, female saints, and the modern and contemporary lives of women. A special focus for Fall 2022 will be the intersection of women's bodies and the liturgical-ritual life of the Church through a global lens, including the experiences of women in the Christian East and Africa."
THEO 20606,"This course seeks to introduce participants to the principal elements in the Catholic Tradition on marriage by examining the sources of this tradition in sacred scripture, the work of ancient Christian writers, the official teachings of the Church and recent theological reflection. The method employed in the course is thus historical, scriptural, and thematic. The readings selected for this course are intended to expose students to contemporary discussion in moral theology apropos of these issues, and provide them with the necessary theological tools to critically evaluate a wide variety of ethical positions dealing with marriage in the Catholic tradition."
THEO 20619,"This course examines the economic dimensions of violence in light of Catholic social teaching and Western political and economic thought.  After an in-depth overview of Catholic social teaching in relation to alternative social theories, we bring them to bear on  the issue of  violence in three social spheres: the domestic (domestic abuse and sexual assault), the economic (sweatshops), and the international political (war).  In each case we will examine Catholic responses to the problem. "
THEO 20639,"This course is intended to be an introduction to Catholic moral theology customized for those discerning a career as a business professional. In the wake of ethical failures at a number of prominent corporations, business leaders have renewed their call for ethical behavior and have begun to establish criteria for hiring morally thoughtful employees and to institute ethics education in the workplace. This is a move which has prompted a number of questions. Are institutions of higher education or small groups of well-meaning business professionals capable of training people to behave ethically? Is the real problem in contemporary business a lack of ethical knowledge, a lack of skill in applying rules to particular cases, or a lack of sensitivity to morally relevant issues? In the first part of the course, we will examine philosophical, theological, and economic interpretations of our current business situation, and we will consider various approaches to thinking about the ethical dimensions of business. In the second part of the course, we will examine the tradition of Catholic theology as a virtue ethics tradition, considering how virtue relates to happiness, law, moral judgment, and one's professional vocation. Third, we will examine Catholic theologies of work and the tradition of Catholic social teaching, with special attention to the relationship between workers and management as well as the norms of justice that ought to govern these relations. The course will conclude with student presentations of original cases."
THEO 20666,"Faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and savior has practical implications for the way believers construe the world, organize their lives and engage with the world. In this course students will be introduced to the basic elements in Christian moral thinking and decision making. We will look at nature of ethics in general and of Christian ethics in particular. We will cover questions related to the specificity of Christian ethics, Jesus and moral thinking, the human (Christian) person as moral agent, and the different methods employed in making ethical decisions. This course is therefore a foundational course which is meant to prepare students for further studies in moral theology and ethics or for life as responsible Christian men and women who are reasonably well equipped to face up to the implications of their faith for life in the world."
THEO 20672,"This course will address sustainability in the context of the local academic community and its institutions. In conversation with the recent papal encyclical, Laudato Si', On Care for Our Common Home, this course will provide students with interdisciplinary opportunities to explore the challenges of sustainability and develop collaborative strategies for making our common campus homes more sustainable. Students will be invited to examine the course materials in conversation with the mission of the Congregation of Holy Cross through immersion at each of the campuses and encounters with professionals whose work impacts sustainability. Please note: In Fall 2022, this course will involve 20 hours of community-based learning with site placements in the local community."
THEO 20673,"Reconciliation is increasingly becoming a popular notion in our time, finding its way into the political rhetoric and public policy of many governments. South Africa and its apparently successful Truth and Reconciliation Commission have captured the imagination of many post conflict societies (including nations like Rwanda, Bosnia, Northern Ireland and communities in the United States as they debate the merits and possibility of similar reconciliation efforts in their communities. Interest in reconciliation in the academic world has also increased, with scholarship on the topic and with institutions setting up reconciliation studies as a specialization sub field in the growing world of peace studies.  It is perhaps not surprising that reconciliation has become a popular buzz world. The end of the cold war did not usher in a new world order of peace that many had hoped for. On the contrary, war, conflict and violence seem to be on the rise in a world marked by growing polarization between religious, ethnic and national identities. In the midst of such a fragmented and broken world, reconciliation is a rallying cry for some hope of healing, conflict resolution and solidarity among peoples.   However, even as reconciliation has become popular, its meaning has remained vague, and its theological connections even more unclear. What difference if any does one's Christian faith make in the way one understands or pursues reconciliation? What's the Christian understanding of reconciliation anyway? What is the relation between reconciliation with God, and reconciliation in its social, political and economic dimensions? Why has Catholic discussions on reconciliation so much focused on the sacrament of reconciliation and not paid as much attention to the notion of social reconciliation? The course seeks to answer these and similar questions. "
THEO 20677,"This course is intended to be a second level theology course that introduces fundamental principles of  Catholic moral theology and Catholic Social Teaching, as oriented specifically for those preparing to  enter the business world. As such, students will be encouraged to think in theological categories about  business and ethics, and to appreciate how these categories bring the light of faith, in unity with the  insights of human reason, to bear on the purpose of business and the possibility of virtuous engagement  in this profession within a just and humane society."
THEO 20679,"In this course, we will study the development of personal moral character and conscience through a series of guided discussions about values, decisions, habits, virtues and vices, the role of the Christian narrative, and finally, an integrated theory of Christian character formation. To illustrate the dimensions of character and conscience we will consider cases and dilemmas in the topic areas of relationships and sexuality, biomedical ethics, and justice concerns. Readings will include selections from writers in contemporary Christian ethics and cases drawn from numerous scholarly and popular sources. Requirements will include attendance at class sessions; significant participation in group discussions; several 3-5-page papers; and a 6-8-page final paper."
THEO 20811,"The first Christians announced that they had experienced salvation in and through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. This course will explore the meaning of that experience for that first generation of believers as well as for today. The first half  of the course will explore a biblical and theological  portrait of the life, ministry, death and resurrection of Jesus and the faith journey of the first disciples. The second half of the course will consider questions about Jesus' identity and the meaning of salvation in the early church and in today's global context including the meaning of Christian hope in a world of suffering and  religious and cultural pluralism, and whether a Christian understanding of salvation includes all persons and all of creation."
THEO 20813,"This course introduces students to the study of theology through a focus on what traditionally has been called spiritual theology. What is the goal of the spiritual life? What practices, relationships, and stages does the spiritual journey involve? How is it reasonable to think that one can live a human life with a divine format, even now, by living in union with God who is love? Why does that form of living satisfy the deepest thirst of the heart, and what does it have to do with changing the world? We will study the scriptural and sacramental basis of spiritual theology, and we will focus on certain historical developments in spiritual theology that are especially relevant in the modern world, such as the theologies of St. Teresa of Avila and St. Ignatius of Loyola. The title of the course echoes a scriptural image that St. Teresa of Avila used as she developed her theology of prayer: Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water (Jn 7:38)."
THEO 20830,"The relationship between Christianity and Islam is absolutely unique, in part because of the way Muslims challenge Christian teaching on Jesus. Muslims insist that Jesus was not god, not a savior and did not die on the Cross. Instead he was a Muslim prophet who predicted the coming of Muhammad. From an Islamic perspective Christian teaching on Christ is confused and the Bible on which it is based is a falsified version of an Islamic revelation which God gave to Jesus. Muhammad came centuries later to correct the errors of Christians and to preach the same eternal religion that Jesus once taught: Islam. Muslims, in other words, have something to say to Christians, that Jesus was a Muslim, that Muhammad is a true prophet, and that God will be pleased by their conversion to Islam. In this course we will listen to how Muslims explain and express this idea, examine how Christians have responded through the centuries, and ask what Christians today have to say back to Islam. NO PRIOR BACKGROUND in Arabic or Islam is required for this course."
THEO 20847,"Christian theologians have long been interested in Buddhism, not least because it promises a complete religion, spirituality, and culture without the existence of God. This class introduces students to the life of the Buddha, Buddhist Scriptures, Buddhist religious orders, and the various schools of Buddhist philosophy in India, China, Korea, Japan, and Tibet. Topics explored include proofs and refutations of God's existence, reincarnation and future lives, the nature of the human person, the origin of evil and suffering, Buddhist approaches to ethics, and contemporary Buddhist-Christian dialogue. No previous knowledge of Buddhism is required."
THEO 20888,"This course investigates the Christian understanding of creation and how this doctrine relates to contemporary scientific issues.  We will examine the development of the doctrine beginning with Scripture and the Creed and progressing through the early Church period into the Medieval and Scholastic era, focusing on the concepts of creation ex nihilo, creation continua, divine Providence, and divine action in the world.  With the rise of the modern era, we will analyze the origin of and principles involved with the purported conflict between science and theology.  We will bring the doctrine of creation into dialogue with three contemporary issues in the sciences: cosmology, evolution, and ecology.  Integral to this course will be the relationship and response of humankind to God and to creation.  This course will have a special appeal to students interested in the intersection of science and theology."
THEO 20895,"In the wake of the Holocaust, the Catholic Church put its relationship with the Jewish people on a new footing with the declaration Nostra Aetate, wherein the Church calls to mind the bond that spiritually ties the people of the New Covenant to Abraham's stock.  In this course we will explore the nature of this bond, and put into practice the call to dialogue that, according to Nostra Aetate, follows from it.  The substantive goals of this course are two.  First, we will study what Christians have thought, and what Christianity - especially Catholicism - has taught across the centuries about Jews and Judaism, and about the relationship between the Church and its Jewish roots.  Second, we will learn about the teachings and practices of Judaism, from the early Christian centuries to today, and engage in theological comparison between Christian and Jewish theology."
THEO 20896,"This course investigates the relationship between the Catholic Faith and modern science for the sake of an integrated worldview in which they are brought into a relational unity, i.e. a dynamic interchange in which their distinct perspectives and methods are carefully respected. We will begin with historical, philosophical, biblical and theological resources for engaging science from the perspective of faith. These will be brought into dialogue with modern cosmology, evolutionary biology and the sciences of human origins in an attempt to forge a holistic perspective in which science, philosophy and theology are treated as distinct but mutually enriching paths to truth. Specific topics will include the conflict model of science and religion, the Galileo Affair, the biblical creation accounts, the doctrines of divine creation and divine providence, and the human person as the image of God."

THEO 30607,"Relationships are critical to our wellbeing as people. Today, however, adolescents and adults today report increased levels of loneliness—a concerning statistic given that loneliness is a risk factor for both physical and mental illnesses. This course considers the impact of relationships on mental health through neuroscientific and theological perspectives, of ering an integrative framework through which students will examine the potential of relationships to both wound and heal. As a community-engaged seminar, the course provides students with opportunities to encounter community members who live with serious mental illness. Four times over the term, students will visit the Clubhouse of St. Joseph County—a program that promotes the recovery of adults living with mental illness by providing a welcoming community, meaningful work, and supported employment. During visits to Clubhouse, students will share in dialogue with Clubhouse members. In-class seminar discussions will address the cultural, personal, and environmental factors that exacerbate experiences of loneliness among those with serious mental illness. The class will culminate with students’ identification of means to strengthen supportive relationships, particularly among those with mental illness, following the principles of solidarity and the common good."
THEO 30702,"This course studies the major themes of Islamic theology. It starts from the early debates concerned with Muslim views of God, the nature of the Quran, the prophethood of Muhammad and ends with current debates about the status of Islamic law (sharia). It also discusses divine vs. human will, the role of politics in Muslim view of salvation and the limits of rationality. It traces how these topics moved from simple formulae to complex concepts due to sociopolitical controversies and conditions, whether they were sectarian or interreligious conflicts, crises of legitimacy, colonialism or modernity. The arguments of various schools are presented, and translated excerpts from prominent theologians are studied. As we read these texts we ask ourselves a number of questions. For example, what alternatives were possible for theologians other than what later became standard Muslim doctrines? What is the importance of imagination in the creation of these theological systems? Did modern Muslim theologians have better options to handle ancient traditions that most of them ended up adopting? Do some modern Muslim theologians have an alternative view to offer? The course is meant to help students see the problems of theology from an Islamic viewpoint that may deepen their understanding of wider"
THEO 30953,"This course will devote the first part of the semester to establishing an account of the historical roots of the current affordable housing crisis in the United States, paying particular attention to the local Michiana context. It will also introduce students to the housing “continuum of care” in the City of South Bend, noting the various institutional and governmental agencies currently involved in addressing housing needs as well as the gaps in coverage, e.g. the need for a permanent low-barrier intake center.   The second part of the course will involve community engagement as students begin to pursue specific research projects. Students will have the opportunity to network with area housing agencies and local government entities and research best practices in other urban areas. During this segment of the course, students will engage with experts in the field, both virtually and in person.  This work will lead into their own constructive proposals for a concrete contribution to meeting the current low-income and supportive housing needs locally, regionally, and/or nationally.  All these signs of the times will be held in conversation with Catholic social teaching, exploring  the concept of housing as a human right and duty in service of the common good."
THEO 31630,"This course will begin with reading David Lancy’s work, The Anthropology of Childhood, in order to form a good intellectual background in this sub-discipline of anthropology.  Then, at Notre Dame’s Shaw Center for Children and Families, students will participate in practicum through one hour of childcare a week of the children of single mothers in addiction recovery while the mothers are in addiction recovery group.  The class will then arrange times to discuss the childcare in light of the anthropology of childhood."

THEO 40002,"This is a two-semester introductory course in biblical Hebrew; under normal circumstances, the student must complete the first to enroll in the second. The fall semester will be devoted to learning the grammar of biblical Hebrew. The spring semester will be divided into two parts. For the first six weeks we will finish and review the grammar. In the remaining part of the course we will read and translate texts from the Hebrew Bible, Qumran, and Rabbinic literature. The course will focus on developing reading and comprehension skills in biblical Hebrew through the study of biblical texts. In addition, students will learn how to use reference grammars, concordances, and apparatus to the Biblica Hebraica. The course encourages students to think about the grammatical forms and their implications for biblical interpretation."

THEO 40101,"This course will offer students an introductory-level survey of the books of the Hebrew Bible, with emphasis placed on the holistic (i.e., theological, literary, and social-scientific) study of the history, literature, and religion of ancient Israel. The implications of selected texts in Christian and Jewish theological discourse will also be explored. Required course components include the major divisions of the Hebrew Bible (Pentateuch, Prophets, and Writings), and writing spans the following research-related genres (case studies, article reviews, journal, and critical notes). Fall only."
THEO 40130,"The texts of the Apostolic Fathers are some of the earliest Christian texts outside the New Testament (some maybe even written before the New Testament was completed). They are a crucial witness to early Christianity in the process of development, working out important pastoral and theological questions. This course will supply a historical, literary, and theological introduction to the texts of the Apostolic Fathers, including the letters of Ignatius, 1 and 2 Clement, the Epistle of Barnabas, Polycarp, the Shepherd of Hermas, Diognetus, and the Didache. MTS students may take this course for either BS or HC credit."
THEO 40201,"This course offers a survey of Christian theology from the end of the New Testament to the eve of the Reformation (well, almost).  Taking the theological idea of Mystery as our theme, we will acquaint ourselves with theologians or theological developments of major significance in the period covered by the survey.  Thus, students will be invited to think about the character and nature of the theological task while investigating major issues, challenges, and questions at the intersection of faith and reason."
THEO 40205,"This course will introduce students to Christian visual art from its evident beginnings (ca. 200), attend to its transformation under imperial patronage, and consider the aftermath of controversies regarding the veneration of icons during the eighth and ninth centuries. Working with both objects and texts, core themes include the continuity between Christian and pagan art of Late Antiquity, the influence of imperial ceremonies and style, the emergence of holy icons, the development of Passion iconography, and the divergent styles, motifs, and theological perspectives on the validity and role of images from the Byzantine East to the early Medieval West."
THEO 40212,"Dante I and Dante II are an in-depth study, over two semesters, of the entire Comedy, in its historical, philosophical and literary context, with selected readings from the minor works (e.g., Vita Nuova, Convivio, De vulgari eloquentia). Dante I focuses on the Inferno and the minor works; Dante II focuses on the Purgatorio and Paradiso. Lectures and discussion in English; the text will be read in the original with facing-page translation. Students may take one semester or both, in either order."
THEO 40239,"The goal of this course is to introduce upper-level undergraduates and master-level students to the methods and procedures, basic literary forms, and main authors of medieval academic (scholastic) theology, from its rise in the twelfth century to examples of Later Medieval and Early Modern periods. The overview will be provided against the backdrop of medieval intellectual history including the institutional development of medieval universities. We shall read and discuss selected chapters from works by Peter Abelard, Peter Lombard, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, William of Ockham, Francisco da Vitoria, and a few others, focusing on the texts that address questions of theological methodology, such as the notion of sacred doctrine (doctrina sacra), sacramental theology, and ecclesiology, particularly on the impact of scholastic discourse on the theological self-understanding of medieval Christianitas. Particular attention will be devoted to literary genres and forms (sententia, summa, distinctio, quaestio, etc.) as well as to the role that medieval canon law played in the development of scholasticism. We will also discuss the reception of Latin scholastic theology in the Greek East and the impact of Thomas Aquinas on Byzantine theological thought of the Later Medieval period."
THEO 40247,"This course covers some of the major figures in the history of (Trinitarian) theology. Figures to be discussed from the patristic and medieval periods include Augustine, Dionysius, Richard of St. Victor, Bonaventure, Aquinas, Eckhart, Tauler, Ruusbroec; figures from the modern period include Elizabeth of the Trinity, Bulgakov, Rahner, Balthasar, Yves Congar, Chiara Lubich, Klaus Hemmerle, and Thomas Weinandy. Corresponding topics include the development of Trinitarian doctrine, differences between the various schools and their models of the Trinity, the relationship between Trinitarian and apophatic theology, the rise of kenotic theology, and theological responses to modern challenges. The goal is to ensure a sufficient basis in the tradition in order to be able to discuss such perennial issues as the much-disputed Filioque, and to show, most importantly, how the doctrine of the Trinity is not just one doctrine among others, but the central doctrine of the Christian faith, which informs not only every other doctrine, but the entirety of the Christian life as a mysterious participation in the primordial reality of the God who is Life from Life and Light from Light."
THEO 40439,"The Church makes the Eucharist and the Eucharist makes the Church. The goal of this course is a comprehensive understanding of the nature and development of the Christian Eucharist. It provides perspective on the origins and historical development of the eucharistic liturgy across traditions, examines the structure and content of eucharistic liturgies (esp. the Roman Mass, but also other liturgical rites), the historical relationship between the Eucharist and the arts (esp. music and architecture) and undertakes a systematic reflection on various theological issues (e.g. real presence, transubstantiation, the role of the priest, excommunication, etc.). Illumined by historical and theological reflection, students will also engage in critically examining contemporary pastoral issues as well as current debates in the liturgy wars."
THEO 40613,"The primary goal of this course is to familiarize students with the tradition of Catholic social teaching with a view toward developing skills for critical reading and appropriation of these documents.  We will examine papal, conciliar, and episcopal texts from Rerum novarum (1891) up to the present time, identifying operative principles, tracing central theological, ethical, and ecclesial concerns, and locating each document in its proper historical context.  We will also hold recurring themes in conversation with the broader theoretical framework of Catholic social thought and relevant secondary literature."
THEO 40627,"Catholicism and Politics poses the question, both simple and complex: How ought Catholics to think about the political order and political issues within it? The first part of the course will survey major responses to this question drawn from Church history: the early church, the medieval church, and the modern church. The second part applies these models to contemporary issues ranging among war, intervention, globalization, abortion, the death penalty, religious freedom, gender issues, and economic development. The course culminates in The Council of Notre Dame, where teams of students, representing church factions, gather to discover church teachings on selected controversial political issues."
THEO 40632,"Since the beginning of humankind, people have asked, why am I here? Where am I going? And how am I called to live my life? What is God calling me to do? In more recent times these enduring questions have been rearticulated around issues of meaning, purpose, human flourishing, and the search to know God's will. Although the culture holds out images of success, fulfillment, and happiness, the quest to discover our heart's desire and make a lasting impact on the world is often elusive. Not infrequently we can make professional, material and financial progress, but at the same time regress in spiritual, ethical and human development. How can we tap into the deeper rivers and sometimes muddy waters within us and wade into the current that leads us to find our most authentic selves and discover the flow of our life's calling? This course is about the inner and outer development that leads into these waters. It will involve both personal reflection and communal connection. When we experience a deep connection to our work and a consistent flow between our life's energies and our daily tasks, we are the most alive, at peace, and whole. The place God calls you, Frederick Buechner once wrote, is the place where your deep gladness and the world's deep hunger meet. But how do we discover our own unique gifts and respond to the hungers of our world? What decisions must we make, and what discernment must we undertake, to find our way? How do we encounter the path that will lead us to integrate both our heart's desire and our desire for social change? This course is designed to help you with these questions.  Drawing on Theology, Spirituality, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, and Design Thinking, we will explore how others have asked these questions before us and how we can explore these questions today. We will use readings, lectures, class discussions, films, learning exercises, papers, and guest speakers to help you discover your talents, values, and vocation, and dream about how you can make a difference in the world.  Although we will look to others for insight, the primary text of this course is your own life, and you will be expected to thoroughly and regularly examine who you are, what you believe, and what you feel called to live out as a human being. In addition to human experience and the expertise of the social sciences, we will look to the wisdom of the great religious traditions to aid you in the process of self-discovery. Our goal is not just to give you more information but to assist you in the process of formation that is directed towards personal and social transformation. As you work at integrating the heart, the mind, the will, and the spirit, we wish to foster a vision of justice, which—from a theological point of view— is about seeking right relationship with God, others, ourselves, and the world around us.ld."
THEO 40641,"In this course, we will critically consider, in light of Catholic Social Teaching, three normative questions regarding the purpose, priorities, and practices of corporations. First, what does the dignity of the human person, as made in the image and likeness of God, mean for people working in business? Second, what do businesses owe to their own workers and the society writ-large, and how do we foster solidarity among those working in business? Third, how can businesses promote authentic human flourishing and integral human development? To answer these questions, we explore certain foundational concepts of Catholic Social Teaching - the dignity of the human person, solidarity and subsidiarity, the virtues of charity and justice, and the common good - and ask how these concepts can be integrated into business practices and corporate governance. To accomplish this end, student wills engage in a close reading of selections from central papal encyclicals on the social question, including Rerum Novarum, Quadragesimo Anno, Laborem Exercens, Centesimus Annus, Caritas in Veritate, and Laudato Si', as well as contemporary scholarship in business ethics that discusses different models of corporate governance.

THEO 40648,"Economics and theology are often thought of as competing or contradictory explanations of human nature and behavior. By beginning with the theological premise that God's creation must hold together as a coherent whole, this course will instead show how economics rightly understood can illuminate our understanding of God's providential activity in the world. We will discuss the fundamental principles and insights of economics, relate them to a philosophical and theological vision of the human person in community, and show the central implications for ethics and political economy."
THEO 40663,"This course examines theology and poetry as two forms of attentive living directed toward love of God and neighbor through a comparative consideration of the meaning of work and the experience of time. These issues are examined in each of the four main parts of the course. In the first part, we examine attentiveness as a distinctive intellectual and spiritual problem for our time. In the second part, the focus will be on social scientific theories of work and how these relate to recent studies about subjectivity and the valuation of work in digital spaces (especially workplaces). In the third part of the course, the focus will shift to the construction/disciplining of subjectivity in Christian liturgical and monastic practices, focusing especially on the interplay of communal prayer and manual labor that has traditionally been part of Christian monastic discipline. In the fourth part, we conclude with a consideration of the work of creating and reading art (especially poetry and painting) in light of the social changes to work and the theological interpretations of work studied in the preceding parts of the course.

THEO 40728,"Christianity arose in a diverse religious environment. Originally in competition with other sects of Judaism and various Greco-Roman religions, Christianity encountered rival Gnostic sects, Manichaeism, and Islam as it spread, eventually entering dialogue with the various religious traditions of Asia and the Americas. This class introduces students to the theology of religions that developed over this long and eventful history. Topics addressed include the presence of God in other religious traditions, explanations of non-Christian virtue, the salvation of non-Christians, the possibilities of universal salvation, and contemporary Inter-religious dialogue, with special emphasis given to magisterial documents after the Second Vatican Council. Readings will include St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Karl Rahner, Jean Danielou, Henri de Lubac, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Joseph Ratzinger, and Jacques Dupuis, among others."
THEO 40773,"The study of religious beliefs and practices in tribal and peasant societies emphasizing myths, ritual, symbolism, and magic as ways of explaining man's place in the universe. Concepts of purity and pollution, the sacred and the profane, and types of ritual specialists and their relation to social structure will also be examined."
THEO 40807,"This course explores the different ways that Christians have understood the relationship between prayer and action in a Christian's spiritual life.  The tendency has been to see prayer as superior to action, since it is the focal point in this life of that union with God which is our destiny in the next.  However, there have been innovative attempts in the history of the tradition to break down overly rigid barriers between these two essential components of the Christian life.  We begin with scriptural loci in the Bible for considering the relationship between prayer and action, and then move to Greek thought, and its fundamental distinction between theoria and praxis.  We then  consider how this conceptual pair was taken over and modified in the history of Christian spirituality in some classic understandings of the relationship between the vita contemplativa and the vita activa. Figures in this section include Augustine, Bernard of Clairvaux, Thomas Aquinas, and Meister Eckhart.  In the next section of the course we consider the late-Medieval and Reformation spiritualities of John Ruusbroec, Ignatius of Loyola, and Teresa of Avila. We conclude with a consideration of two contemporary Christian thinkers and how they carry on but also modify models from the tradition: Gustavo Gutiérrez and Thomas Merton."
THEO 40862,"What does it look like for the Church to faithfully carry out its mission in the midst of the modern world?  In what ways do the philosophical and cultural presuppositions of modernity undermine or oppose fundamental Catholic beliefs and ways of living? What positive opportunities are offered in modernity for strengthening the Church and Catholic life? This course will explore the Catholic Church's relation to the modern world, with particular attention to the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). Vatican II greatly impacted almost every aspect of Catholic life and thought, including the practice of the liturgy, the role of the laity in the Church, the relationship between the Church and politics, teaching on religious liberty, the Church's relation to other religions, and much else. The course will center on a close reading of the actual texts from Vatican II and will give students the opportunity to explore the teachings, debates, and developments that arose from the Council throughout the world as pastoral and theological responses to the diverse challenges of modernity."
THEO 40877,"This course explores the relationship between the Judeo-Christian conceptions of salvation and the human desire for liberation from oppression and avoidable hardships. From a biblical perspective, salvation is about more than getting into heaven. Contemporary theologians, primarily from the Global South and among the marginalized within First World countries, have led the way in reviving this biblical insight and applying it to the suffering and political struggles of today's world. This course traces the meanings of salvation as articulated in the Bible, early Christian history, and Christian movements among the marginalized in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. If you perceive the need for social change, this course will provide you with a better sense of thinking theologically and spiritually about salvation in relationship to both God's call for liberative social transformation and current human activity corresponding to that call. "
THEO 40880,"The Christian confession of a God of infinite love and goodness seems to be severely challenged by the immensity of suffering and evil. This course explores different theological responses to the theoretical and practical problems presented by suffering and evil. Attention will also be given to how Scripture, psychology, and film have addressed these issues. The format of the course will consist of lectures, discussions, and the close reading and analysis of seminal texts. (Students who have attended the 2xxxx version of the course will not be eligible for registration.)   "
THEO 40883,"This course is an extended study of the phenomenon of death as it relates to human being, human experience, and the human relationship with God. Alongside sources from the Jewish and Christian theological traditions, we will engage philosophical, theoretical, spiritual, and comparative religious perspectives. The course will be composed of four units: (1) Death and Finitude, which concerns death as a structural feature of human nature and existence, (2) Death and Subjectivity, which concerns the manner by which conduct ourselves and compose our self-understanding with respect to our mortality, (3) Death in Comparison, which concerns the role and understanding of death in other religious traditions, and (4) Death and the Theological Virtues, which will explore the relationship between death and faith, hope, and love. The course seeks to cultivate an intellectually robust, conceptually sophisticated, yet distinctly Christian theory of death, its meaning, and its inevitability."

The Colloquium should provide a sense of esprit-de-corps for the thesis writers; introduce students to general reference sources and theological data-bases; and help young scholars to become self-aware of methods of research and conventions in academic theological writing."
THEO 60002,"This is a two-semester introductory course in biblical Hebrew; under normal circumstances, the student must complete the first to enroll in the second. The fall semester will be devoted to learning the grammar of biblical Hebrew. The spring semester will be divided into two parts. For the first six weeks we will finish and review the grammar. In the remaining part of the course we will read and translate texts from the Hebrew Bible, Qumran, and Rabbinic literature. The course will focus on developing reading and comprehension skills in biblical Hebrew through the study of biblical texts. In addition, students will learn how to use reference grammars, concordances, and apparatus to the Biblica Hebraica. The course encourages students to think about the grammatical forms and their implications for biblical interpretation."
THEO 60006,"The first semester of Intermediate Hebrew aims to complete and solidify students' knowledge of the fundamentals of Biblical Hebrew grammar, to enlarge students' store of Biblical Hebrew vocabulary, and to enable students to become fluent readers of classical Biblical Hebrew prose."
THEO 60105,"This Masters course is designed to acquaint students with the rich diversity of literatures and theological developments within the history of ancient Israel.  Readings include both primary sources (the Bible and select readings from the ancient Near East in translation) and secondary sources.  The readings, lectures, and class discussions are intended to assist students in their understanding, assessment, and appreciation of the (good) Old Testament."
THEO 60113,"The purpose of this course is to introduce the student at the Master's level to present-day study of the Gospel of John. The Gospel will be covered by the interaction between class lectures on specific disputed topics or pericopes on the one hand and the reading of a Gospel commentary on the other. The major methods employed will be those of source, form, and redaction criticism, though recent literary theories will also be considered. Since this course is offered in the Department of Theology, the emphasis of the lectures will be on a synthetic overview of the theology of John's Gospel, divided into major themes, rather than on an exegesis of the whole Gospel in order. An overview of the whole Gospel in the order in which it was written will be gained by reading the commentary, quizzes on the readings, and discussions following the quizzes."
THEO 60185,"The texts of the Apostolic Fathers are some of the earliest Christian texts outside the New Testament (some maybe even written before the New Testament was completed). They are a crucial witness to early Christianity in the process of development, working out important pastoral and theological questions. This course will supply a historical, literary, and theological introduction to the texts of the Apostolic Fathers, including the letters of Ignatius, 1 and 2 Clement, the Epistle of Barnabas, Polycarp, the Shepherd of Hermas, Diognetus, and the Didache. MTS students may take this course for either BS or HC credit."
THEO 60210,"This course is intended for MTS students and makes them acquainted with major developments of early modern and modern theological and philosophical thought, roughly from the Reformation to the 20th century. Figures who will be discussed include Erasmus, Spinoza, Teresa of Avila, Kant, and topics like theories of modernity (e.g. Hartmut Rosa). "
THEO 60216,"This course covers representative theologies from the 6th century to the 21rst century, from St. Benedict to Dorothy Day. Our reflection on these theologies will be loosely centered around a metaphor that many of the texts use or imply, that of a ‘road' or the ‘way' to God. What could be the meaning of this metaphor?—especially since none of the texts we will read believe that God can be located in any particular place. As we attend to this discovery, the course will also allow students to become familiar with major figures and positions within the Christian Tradition, including a sense of the variety of theological genres across the centuries, all while helping students develop and refine skills in the reading and interpretation of theological texts. Hopefully these goals also allow the course to assist students in their own reflections on the life of faith."
THEO 60239,"This online MA course is a deep treatment of the life and work of Servant of God, Dorothy Day. From her own autobiography to her hagiography of Therese of Lisieux, we will encounter the woman Pope Francis has called one of the 4 most interesting Americans."

THEO 60248,"This course will introduce students to Christian visual art from its evident beginnings (ca. 200), attend to its transformation under imperial patronage, and consider the aftermath of controversies regarding the veneration of icons during the eighth and ninth centuries. Working with both objects and texts, core themes include the continuity between Christian and pagan art of Late Antiquity, the influence of imperial ceremonies and style, the emergence of holy icons, the development of Passion iconography, and the divergent styles, motifs, and theological perspectives on the validity and role of images from the Byzantine East to the early Medieval West."
THEO 60250,"The passage of many centuries since the birth of Christianity may sometimes have the effect of dulling our appreciation of how pressing the questions facing the early Church were. How does our faith relate to Judaism? Are the Scriptures of Israel truly the Word of God? How should we view the secular state and secular learning? These and other questions were worked out in a rich context of expressed Christian identity: a developing canon of Sacred Scripture, liturgical worship, a sense of moral difference and evangelical mission. Early Christian communities produced colorful and compelling figures such as clergy, prophets, laypeople, apologists, martyrs, and monastics. At the heart of it all lies the ultimate question: the figure of Jesus himself, who claimed to enjoy a unique filial relationship with the God of Israel. The quest for adequate ways of speaking about this relationship, which forms the generative center of Christian faith, gave rise to the great Christological and Trinitarian debates of the fourth and fifth centuries. The course will seek an understanding of these debates not as dry, rarefied, academic quarrels, but as issues of great moment for Christian self-understanding."
THEO 60283,"Neoplatonic philosophy is one of the or maybe even the most influential intellectual movement in Late Antiquity, the Middle Ages and into modern times. Neoplatonic ideas shaped philosophical, theological, mystical and literary texts and art and architecture. The course will study a wide range of Neoplatonic texts and of texts inspired by Neoplatonism from Antiquity into the Middle Ages, including the Byzantine, Latin and Arabic tradition. As the intellecutal basis of the course, we will first study pagan Neoplatonism in late Antiquity. We will focus mainly on the founder of Neoplatonism Plotinus who transforms Platonic thought and combines it with Aristotelean ideas without neglecting Stoic input as well. Later developments in Neoplatonism will be dicussed as well, since they are the basis of Christian transformations of Neoplatonism (e.g. Porphyry, Proclus). Then we will move to the first Christian transformations of Neoplatonic thought in late Antiquity, especially Dionysius the Areopagite, but also Boethius and Augustine. After a briefer detour to Neoplatonism in Byzantium we will focus on the neoplatonic traditions in the Middle Ages, focusing especially on the first translations of Dionysius the Areopagite and his reception in philosophy, theology, mysticism and art. Furthermore, we will take a look at the Arabic tradition.Topics dicussed in the course will include: 1) The Good, the One and God; 2) Intellect; 3) Soul; 4) Self, person, self-consciousness; 5) the intelligible realm and the visible world; 6) body; 7) matter 8) evil; 9) freedom; 10) the ascent of the soul and the union with the divine; 11) art and its anagocial power. Most texts will be read in translation, but we will also look at selected passages in Greek or Latin (for those who read these languages; they are not a requirement for the course).The course is by design a graduate course, but could be opened to well-qualified undergraduates."
THEO 60288,"The goal of this course is to introduce upper-level undergraduates and master-level students to the methods and procedures, basic literary forms, and main authors of medieval academic (scholastic) theology, from its rise in the twelfth century to examples of Later Medieval and Early Modern periods. The overview will be provided against the backdrop of medieval intellectual history including the institutional development of medieval universities. We shall read and discuss selected chapters from works by Peter Abelard, Peter Lombard, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, William of Ockham, Francisco da Vitoria, and a few others, focusing on the texts that address questions of theological methodology, such as the notion of sacred doctrine (doctrina sacra), sacramental theology, and ecclesiology, particularly on the impact of scholastic discourse on the theological self-understanding of medieval Christianitas. Particular attention will be devoted to literary genres and forms (sententia, summa, distinctio, quaestio, etc.) as well as to the role that medieval canon law played in the development of scholasticism. We will also discuss the reception of Latin scholastic theology in the Greek East and the impact of Thomas Aquinas on Byzantine theological thought of the Later Medieval period."

THEO 60404,"The Church makes the Eucharist and the Eucharist makes the Church. The goal of this course is a comprehensive understanding of the nature and development of the Christian Eucharist. It provides perspective on the origins and historical development of the eucharistic liturgy across traditions, examines the structure and content of eucharistic liturgies (esp. the Roman Mass, but also other liturgical rites), the historical relationship between the Eucharist and the arts (esp. music and architecture) and undertakes a systematic reflection on various theological issues (e.g. real presence, transubstantiation, the role of the priest, excommunication, etc.). Illumined by historical and theological reflection, students will also engage in critically examining contemporary pastoral issues as well as current debates in the liturgy wars."
THEO 60602,"This course introduces the history and patterns of thought that provide the foundations for contemporary discussions about moral theology in the Roman Catholic Church. Its central aim will be to position moral theology as a practical and pastoral expression of Christian faith, but also as a tradition of inquiry relevant to wider discussions about moral matters. Topics to be considered include: sources for moral theology, genres of moral writing, the nature of the human person and her relationship to the community of disciples, the dynamics of moral action, and the topics of freedom, experience, authority, virtue, and forgiveness. "
THEO 60663,"This course examines theology and poetry as two forms of attentive living directed toward love of God and neighbor through a comparative consideration of the meaning of work and the experience of time. These issues are examined in each of the four main parts of the course. In the first part, we examine attentiveness as a distinctive intellectual and spiritual problem for our time. In the second part, the focus will be on social scientific theories of work and how these relate to recent studies about subjectivity and the valuation of work in digital spaces (especially workplaces). In the third part of the course, the focus will shift to the construction/disciplining of subjectivity in Christian liturgical and monastic practices, focusing especially on the interplay of communal prayer and manual labor that has traditionally been part of Christian monastic discipline.

THEO 60801,"This course is a graduate level introduction to the nature, tasks, and methods of systematic theology. The first half of the course explores the following issues of fundamental theology: theologies of revelation; the relationship between revelation and faith, faith and reason, and faith and belief; the meaning of tradition and the interrelationship of scripture and tradition; the development and interpretation of doctrine; and the roles of the hierarchical magisterium, theologians, and the community of the baptized in preserving, interpreting and handing on the authentic Christian tradition. The second half of the course provides a broad survey and analysis of diverse contemporary methods of doing systematic theology with particular attention to the underlying theologies of revelation and the use and interpretation of sources."
THEO 60808,"This course covers some of the major figures in the history of (Trinitarian) theology. Figures to be discussed from the patristic and medieval periods include Augustine, Dionysius, Richard of St. Victor, Bonaventure, Aquinas, Eckhart, Tauler, Ruusbroec; figures from the modern period include Elizabeth of the Trinity, Bulgakov, Rahner, Balthasar, Yves Congar, Chiara Lubich, Klaus Hemmerle, and Thomas Weinandy. Corresponding topics include the development of Trinitarian doctrine, differences between the various schools and their models of the Trinity, the relationship between Trinitarian and apophatic theology, the rise of kenotic theology, and theological responses to modern challenges. The goal is to ensure a sufficient basis in the tradition in order to be able to discuss such perennial issues as the much-disputed Filioque, and to show, most importantly, how the doctrine of the Trinity is not just one doctrine among others, but the central doctrine of the Christian faith, which informs not only every other doctrine, but the entirety of the Christian life as a mysterious participation in the primordial reality of the God who is Life from Life and Light from Light."
THEO 60811,"The reality of grace is one of the fundamental mysteries of Christian faith, a mystery made all the more difficult for today's believers due to the modern loss of a sense and vocabulary adequate to the accurate naming of the things of God (Flannery O'Connor). This situation puts two tasks on the agenda for this course. The first is to consider the origin and development of the doctrines and theology of grace, beginning with its roots in Scripture, and continuing with important figures or events in its ensuing development, attending to the different genres of their theological work: including Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Julian of Norwich, Martin Luther, and the Council of Trent. Secondly, we look at how modern figures take up traditional formulations of the doctrine of grace in order to communicate it in the modern age: Karl Rahner and Flannery O'Connor. Our concern throughout the course will be not only to understand the parameters of a Catholic understanding of grace, but to consider different ways of communicating it effectively to a modern audience."

In 2017, however, scholars are more divided than ever over the question of Islamic origins. Rénan's confidence stemmed from the appearance in his day of medieval Muslim biographies of Muhammad, which in their detailed descriptions of the Muslim prophet seemed to offer reliable historical data. Yet they are also late sources. The earliest Islamic biographies date from approximately 150 years after the traditional death date of Muhammad (632).The only earlier sources that scholars have to work with are the Quran --a text marked by Biblical allusions and religious exhortation, not historical narratives --and the early Jewish and Christian literature that alludes to the rise of a new religious movement in the Near East. All three sources -the Quran, and classical Islamic sources, and early non-Muslim literature -present particular interpretive challenges.In this seminar we will address the question of Islamic origins by appreciating the particular types and functions of these sources. At the same time we will examine the debate over these sources in recent scholarship, with particular attention to the theories of those scholars who argue that the origins of Islam are closely related to the development of Christianity in the Late Antique Near East. In this regard the present seminar is not a foray into Religious Studies as much as an examination of a movement (Islam) that is closely connected to Christianity, and of a text (the Quran) that itself claims to present the proper interpretation of Biblical narratives. Accordingly students are not assumed to have any special background in Islamic Studies or Arabic. They will be asked, on the other hand, to apply their knowledge of the history of Christianity (and Judaism) to the study of Islamic origins."
THEO 83227,"Francis of Assisi (1181–1226) was canonized in July 16, 1228, prior to the composition of Thomas of Celano’s first Life of the saint, the Vita Prima commissioned by Pope Gregory IX and subsequently approved by him in 1229 for publication. In the decades following Francis’s canonization, the story of the saint was told and retold by different hagiographers in diverse ways, involving writers and readers in an intense, devotional, theological, liturgical, and polemical enterprise that culminated in Bonaventure of Bagnoregio’s Legenda Maior (1266). Reflective of anti-mendicant arguments at the universities, of Dominican / Franciscan disagreements about evangelical perfection, of internal divisions among Franciscans about the demands of discipleship, of apocalyptic theologies, of changes in the canonization process, and of Scholastic approaches to biblical reading, Bonaventure’s Legenda Maior invites a multi-dimensional analysis."
THEO 83401,"The aim of this seminar is to gain a critical knowledge of the primary sources that are available and of the methods used for the study of Christian worship in the first four centuries. Special attention will be given to considering the secondary literature produced in the field in recent years. Among the areas covered will be baptism, eucharist, daily prayer, and the emergence of feasts and seasons. The course should be of value to any student interested in the development of the early church."
THEO 83424,"This interdisciplinary seminar considers practices surrounding the care of the dying, funeral rites, burial practices, mourning, and beliefs about the resurrection of the body in early Christianity. Students will engage texts as well as physical evidence (e.g., tombs, cemeteries, memorial inscriptions, and visual art) to gain a broad understanding of the ways Christian practices and beliefs about death and the afterlife are both like and unlike those of their non-Christian contemporaries.

THEO 83668,"What is the relationship between God and Mammon?  As AMC Waterman argues, political economy arguably displaced theology as the center of public discourse by the 19th century.   Theologians thus need to engage with economics.  The question is how?  In this course we will begin with some basic principles of economics, with attention to the anthropology that tacitly undergirds the discipline.  We will look at some of major economic texts (Smith, Malthus, Becker).  Then we will turn to the Christian tradition to examine its engagement with economic questions, beginning with scripture and the Church fathers, continuing through Aquinas and the reformation, and ending with the Anglican theologians who played a role in launching economics as an independent discipline.  The course will conclude with Stephen Long's Divine Economy, which surveys the modern field of theology and economics."
THEO 83669,"This course is an examination of St. Thomas Aquinas' moral theology.  It takes it starting point from Thomas' own writings, and engages these texts as part of an ongoing and living tradition by examining them in historical context, attending to their sources, and mining them for their wisdom on enduring questions of moral theology.  Students are thus invited to participate in the tradition of Thomistic moral theology by engaging his texts and as well as his historical and contemporary interlocutors."
THEO 83710,"The course explores the Christian theological difference to a vision and practice of peace in the world. The course has two parts. Part one is a theoretical exploration of the standard formulation of peacebuilding and more specifically of the religious contribution to strategic peacebuilding. The goal of this this first part is to attempt a preliminary mapping of the contributions, approaches and methodologies that sustain the discussion of religion and peacebuilding. In so doing, we will seek to come to a better appreciation of the possibilities as well as the limitations of the category of religion within the field of peace studies.  The critical thrust of this first section will be to show that the political and methodological assumptions of the category of religion does not do full justice to the experience of faith as a way of life, grounded in and shaped by a matrix of practices and disciplines, whose positive impulse is to shape believers into a vision and patterns of peace in the world.  It is this thick matrix of faith that theology investigates and seeks to articulate.   In the second part, using representative stories of individuals and communities, the course will explore the theological matrix that informs and sustains the Christian practice of peace. Among others, the scriptural imagination, lament, hope, and conversion will be identified as key disciplines within this matrix. But because these disciplines are produced and reproduced in the habitual practices of a community of faith, it makes Christian peacebuilding a form of improvisation which takes place within particular, local and specific contexts. The stories display not only the inner logic of a Christian theology of peace, but the multiple possibilities of Christian peacebuilding efforts in the world."
THEO 83811,"With the gradual demise of the Neo-scholastic hegemony in Catholic theology, a resultant greater diversity in theological approaches, and the pressing need to account for new intellectual and pastoral demands on theology at the end of modernity, a number of theologians responded by articulating (and defending argumentatively) more clearly the goals, sources, argumentative strategies, and canons of justification for theology.  This course will consider two preeminent figures in this genre:  the American theologian, David Tracy, and the Basque/Salvadoran, Ignacio Ellacuría.  Tracy is representative of a focus on philosophical hermeneutics as a fruitful place to begin sketching answers for answering the questions given above, while Ellacuría represents the turn to praxis in twentieth-century political and liberation theologies.  Our task will be to understand how each took up tools from other disciplines (primarily philosophy), while also reconfiguring them in conformity to the unique character of theology.  Students will write analytical responses weekly, commit to leading a discussion (individually or in pairs), and write a final research paper."
THEO 83838,"This course is offered as a doctoral seminar on major figures in twentieth-century theology, including E. Przywara, H. de Lubac, K. Rahner, B. Lonergan, H. U. von Balthasar, J-L Marion, and S. Bulgakov as a means of clarifying major topics in twentieth-century theology, including the relationship between phenomenology and theology, the analogy of being, transcendental Thomism, the distinction between nature/grace, theological method and epistemology, and the relationship between German idealism and Russian Sophiology.
