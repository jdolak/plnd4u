Along the way we will examine the rise and fall of &quot;Indian&quot; slavery, the cultural meanings of Blackness, the labor and economic conditions in urban settings as well as on rural plantations, and the strategies that enslaved people used to negotiate living conditions and achieve freedom. We will also pay careful attention to different kinds of resistance, including the formation of stable palenques of those who escaped slavery and a variety of rebellions, including the successful Haitian Revolution.
AFST 20302	More than a century before African slaves were trafficked to the Virginia colony in 1619, Christopher Columbus transported captured indigenous peoples to Spain from the New World. The dispossession and enslavement of non-Europeans in the colonization of the Americas was justified by Christians but also condemned by Christians with different economic and political interests. This development course in theology introduces students to the challenging intersection of faith, slavery, and freedom by exploring key figures, events, and movements that have shaped the complex historical legacy of Christianity in the Americas, a hemispheric past that remains ever bound together. In addition to Christianity's role in colonial expansion and racial ideology, the course especially considers how lived faith in God provided a catalyst for the empowerment and resistance of the oppressed and their advocates in shared struggles to attain greater social justice, racial equality, and political autonomy. From the &quot;Protector of the Indians&quot; Bartolomé de las Casas to César Chávez, and the &quot;Black Moses&quot; Harriet Tubman to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the course explores these and other extraordinary figures of hope in the Americas who gave their lives to protest social violence and promote authentic expressions of faith. In the course, students will engage this turbulent past through a contextual approach to theology that examines idolatry, migration, land, liberty, poverty, social sin, nonviolence, and solidarity as normative categories relevant for addressing contemporary social crises afflicting our nation and earth.
AFST 20401	A music appreciation course requiring no musical background and no prerequisites. General coverage of the history, various styles, and major performers of jazz, with an emphasis on current practice. Receive permission from the instructor (ldwyer@nd.edu)
AFST 20600	This course will focus on the relationship between democratic institutions, peace, and economic/human development. While drawing on lessons from North America and Europe, we will focus largely on countries of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. During the semester, we will discuss and debate the merits of various explanations or hypotheses that political scientists have proposed to answer the following questions: Why are some countries more &quot;developed&quot; and democratic than others? Is development necessary for democracy or democracy necessary for development? What is the relationship between culture, development, and democracy?  How do different types of political institutions affect the prospects for development and democracy? Should/how should U.S. and other established democracies promote democratization? By the end of the course, the objectives are that students (1) learn the most important theories intended to explain why some countries are more democratic and &quot;developed&quot; than others, (2) understand the complexity of any relationship between democracy and development, and (3) grow in the ability to think about and intelligently assess the strengths and weaknesses of strategies intended to promote democracy and development.
AFST 20781	This course will examine the Latino experience in the United States, including the historical, cultural, and political foundations of Latino life. We will approach these topics comparatively, thus attention will be given to the various experiences of a multiplicity of Latino groups in the United States. This course has an optional community-engaged learning component with La Casa de Amistad.
AFST 30001	This course will explore the techniques of investigative journalism and produce high-quality public service projects based in the local community. It begins with a survey of the history of investigative reporting, from early 20th century muckrakers like Upton Sinclair to Woodward and Bernstein to new models in today's online world. Students will learn how to identify and judge potential investigative topics, work with databases to find solid documentation, interview a wide range of sources, and write stories appropriate to different journalism platforms. Students will work toward producing a piece that is publishable in a local newspaper or website
AFST 30077	This course will focus on exercises, research and reading from a diverse range of historical and current influential environmental writings from philosophers, economists, environmentalists, theologians, political scientists, naturalists, and practitioners. Learners will analyze the impact that human actions have on the natural world–particularly through foodways, or the social, cultural, and economic practices of producing and consuming food. This course will also explore how our understanding of race/ethnicity, nature, and the environment influences human choices around food. And it offers alternative courses of action toward viable, ethical, and antiracist solutions to questions about sustainable farming, global economic inequality, and world hunger. Throughout the semester, participants will use the lens of race and ethnicity to study and discuss how these two concepts affect access to agricultural land, foodstuffs/ foodways, environmental justice and nature. A fundamental objective will be to create podcasts focused on student’s engagement with the course themes.
AFST 30102	While taking a hemispheric approach to black writing, this course will examine the creation of the black first person through autobiography. Taking up classic texts from across the Americas and the Caribbean, such as Biography of a Runaway Slave, Child of the Dark, The Narrative of the Life of Fredrick Douglass, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, and Black Boy, we will explore the multiple ways in which black writers create the black rhetorical self. Why is the black &quot;I&quot; ubiquitous across African American writing of the hemisphere, and what are its implications in relation to race, gender, class, and community? What does it mean for a black narrator to announce her or himself as author or speaking subject? What does it mean to speak or write oneself into the public's consciousness, and why does it matter? What are the constitutive elements of a black rhetorical self, and how might they differ from other racial/ethnic identities?
AFST 30104	This course offers a broad thematic overview of the history of capitalism from the early sixteenth century up to the late 1980s. As a discussion-based seminar, we will devote most of our conversations to discovering, analyzing and reflecting on the transformation of the U.S. from a newly-independent British colony, to the most influential economic power in the world. Topics and themes we will consider include: the rise of early modern transnational capitalism, European imperialism and trade, and indigenous dispossession after 1492; science and technological transformations; social and economic thought; slavery and servitude, broadly construed; and characteristics of prosperity, wealth, and economic flux. Our readings and viewings will be a mix of scholarly and primary sources, including an abundance of canonical literary and artistic material, such as novels, visual art, and film excerpts (e.g. Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House (1879), Aaron Douglas's Building More Stately Mansions (1944), and Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence (1920)). Over the course of the semester, students will draw upon this eclectic combination of sources to synthesize the dominant historical dimensions of capitalism in and beyond the U.S. via four short essays (4 - 5 pages, double-spaced-between 1,100 and 1,400 words), and a final paper (10 - 12 pages, double-spaced) based on cumulative texts. 
AFST 30105	America, at its core, is an idea.  The lands that became America have been imagined and in certain ways and constantly reimagined. The history of the ideas that made America is less a lesson in philosophy and more about a series of clashes between contending visions: Democracy vs. Republicanism; Free vs. Slave; Christian vs. Secular; Individual vs. Society; and Universal vs. Particular. This course traces a long arc from the Puritans to the Culture Wars to understand the ideas Americans draw upon to comprehend the world and act in it.Lectures and discussions will consider the notions of equality, democracy, pluralism, religious freedom, and the tensions between contending visions for America.  Readings for this course will include autobiographies, speeches, sermons, canonical texts, lyrics, novels, newspaper articles, and poetry.
AFST 30114	While it is a notoriously difficult concept to define, “race” is undoubtedly a powerful force in American life. Focusing on the late nineteenth century to the present, this course examines the ways in which racial ideas are formed, negotiated, and resisted in the arenas of American literature and popular culture. From the story of racial confusion in Mark Twain’s Pudd’nhead Wilson (1894) to contemporary cultural politics of performance and appropriation, this course will ask how popular culture actively shapes—rather than merely reflects—American ideas about race and ethnicity. A key aim of the class is to go beyond looking for “good” and “bad” pop culture texts to explore the deeper meanings of racism and antiracism. By closely engaging with a diverse set of theoretical, historical, and primary texts, students will learn to approach and analyze popular culture with a critical eye
AFST 30215	The purpose of this interdisciplinary course is twofold: to examine the social context and cultural change of the sixties and to explore the various journalistic and aesthetic representations of events, movements, and transformations.  We will focus on the manner in which each writer or artist witnessed the sixties and explore fresh styles of writing and cultural expression, such as the new journalism popularized by Tom Wolfe and the music/lyrics performed by Bob Dylan.  Major topics for consideration include the counterculture and the movement--a combination of civil rights and anti-war protest.
AFST 30232	This course provides an introduction to the history of American slavery. After examining the origins and transformation of Atlantic world slavery, the course focuses particularly upon slavery in the United States. Between the American Revolution and the Civil War, the United States grew into the largest slaveholding society in the modern world. U.S. slavery's growth was driven forward by massive global economic transformations and territorial conquest. Yet, in the face of unprecedented violence, enslaved people themselves brought about the end of slavery and transformed the meaning of freedom in the United States. This course focuses upon this history from the perspective of enslaved people themselves with particular attention to struggles for freedom. Through an examination of this history and its legacies, the course will introduce students to histories of resistance.
AFST 30245	In 1975, the African-American writer Ishmael Reed put culture at the center of politics: “If I have your are evering my art, behaving like me and adopting my psychology, then I’ve got you. If I’ve got your head, I’ve got you.” Confronted with the whiteness of U.S. publishing and school curricula, Reed and his peers saw literature as a key front in this broader struggle over the making and unmaking of American identity. Yet the question of literature’s contribution to the struggle elicited stark disagreement. Would it counter racial stereotype with accurate representation or refuse the burden of racial representativeness? Would it lay claim to the American nation on behalf of the racially minoritized, or throw in with different political horizons? Would it address the white reader unfamiliar with the realities of racial oppression, or the non-white reader seeking a different relation to histories already lived? These disagreements would only intensify in the following decades as the call multicultural representation became increasingly institutionalized – with syllabi and publishing undergoing modest diversification, and universities framing racial difference as a strategic asset.Moving from the late 20th century to the present, our course attends to how these political ambitions and desires informed the writing, publishing, and teaching of American literature by writers of color. It asks how these authors not only engaged in activism by literary means, but also reckoned with the artistic and political dilemmas that attended this doubled pursuit. To this end, the bulk of our readings will draw from literary fiction, non-fiction, and poetry, including authors like Gloria Anzaldua, Percival Everett, Maxine Hong Kingston, Brandon Taylor, and Wendy Trevino.
AFST 30246	Whether it is controversies about the removal of statues, bans on teaching the New York Times’s The 1619 Project, critiques of the musical Hamilton, or originalist interpretations of the United States Constitution, early America seems to have gained new prominence in debates about the present-day United States. But why does this period—which spans four centuries from approximately 1450 to 1850—hold such meaning today? And what does this history have to teach us about our present moment? In this class, we will learn about the vast, diverse, and complex world of early America and use this knowledge to better understand current issues and events. Like Americans today, early Americans dealt with pandemics, racial injustice, political corruption, and economic inequality. They adapted to changing markets, globalization, and climate change. What do their experiences have to teach us about navigating these issues in our own time?
AFST 30260	Popular perceptions of Africa are almost wholly defined by the last century and a half of its history, first under the boot of European imperial powers and then struggling to rebuild sovereignty and stability in the post-colonial world. Apart from the slave trade, most often narrated as an American story that happens to begin in Africa, little of the continent’s rich pre-modern past earns more than a passing mention in global history. This course aims to shine a spotlight on these neglected stories and examine the many contributions of Africans to the course of human history. We will begin with Africa as the ancients knew it, a land of bright sunshine, proud empires, and legendary wealth. We’ll then examine the continent’s long history of trade with the wider world, both in goods and in people. Finally, we will consider the sources of the great upheavals that swept the continent in the 19th century and how they heralded the coming of colonization. Along the way, we will work with a wide range of sources, from legends and travelogues to fiction and film, in order to better appreciate the lives and perspectives of everyday Africans.
AFST 30298	In this seminar we will examine the historical construction of gendered and sexual roles in the Spanish colonial world. This will entail thinking about gender and sexuality in the societies which &quot;encountered&quot; each other in the New World, and also thinking about how that encounter produced new forms of gendered and sexual relations. Among the questions we'll consider: how was the conquest gendered? How did colonial society produce masculinities as well as femininities? What gendered forms of power were available to women? How did ethnicity and casta (a status attributed to mixed race peoples), as well as gender and class, determine people's sense of themselves and their &quot;others&quot;? What were normative and non-normative sexual roles in the pre-modern Americas, and how did a European Catholic conquest affect these?
AFST 30601	This course introduces students to the dynamics of the social and historical construction of race and ethnicity in  American political life. The course explores the following core questions: What are race and ethnicity? What are  the best ways to think about the impact of race and ethnicity on American citizens? What is the history of racial and ethnic formation in American political life? How do race and ethnicity link up with other identities animating  political actions like gender and class? What role do American political institutions (the Congress, presidency, judiciary, state and local governments, etc.) play in constructing and maintaining these identity categories? Can these institutions ever be used to overcome the points of division in American society?
AFST 30682	This course will focus on the writings of Black political thinkers in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. Through critical examination of the conditions against, and contexts within, which the political theories of these thinkers are situated, this course hopes to arrive at some understanding of the principles, goals and strategies developed to contest and redefine notions/concepts of citizenship (vis-a-vis the imperatives of race/racism and the global colonial formations), humanity, justice, equality, development, democracy, and freedom.
AFST 30691	In 2007, after decades of organizing on the part of indigenous activists, the United Nations issued a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Declaration was the result of years of work by people from particular communities--each with its own history, culture, language, and home--who decided to call themselves, and work together as, Indigenous people. This creative step allowed indigenous peoples to work collectively for justice on a global scale, rather than individually and in confrontation with single states. This class explores the concept, and reality, of Indigeneity in both historical and contemporary perspective: we will consider the many shared struggles and opportunities of indigenous peoples around the globe today and the ways that similar (or distinct) histories have led to similar (or distinct) present realities.
AFST 30692	This course examines the origins and development of contemporary opinions and policies concerning migrations and migrants. It does so by looking backward to the age when transoceanic mobility became more frequent and increasingly more accessible before moving forward to our own times. It is the central claim of this course that it is impossible to understand what drives policy today without first surveying the changing ideas of migration and the movement of people over time. It will therefore take students through the history of migration in the modern world, as well as studying the migrant journey, connections to home, the process and difficulties of assimilation and community creation, and the problems or opportunities that could arise for migrants from characteristics like race, religion, ethnicity, or language. Also considered will be the complex relationship between colonization and migration. In the process, Migrants and Mobility will also examine how different societies place value judgments upon migrants and analyze how and why migration/migrants have been categorized as “good” or “bad” over time. Students will also encounter and consider the effects of growing urbanization and industrialization, changing demography and global trade patterns, and, more recently, the impact of climate change. Migrants and Mobility will be primarily seminar based, placing a premium on participation and analytical discussion.
AFST 33004	Prior to the 18th century, children were viewed as little adults. The invention of childhood grew during the Age of Enlightenment along with the rapid increase of printed titles (1620: 6,000 vs. end of 18th century: 56,000). As a result, religious texts began to lose dominance over the written word, and thus grew a new body of literature for children. The critical study of literature for children has made significant growth since its modest beginnings in the early twentieth century, which we will examine in this course. We will also explore the creation of childhood, children as imagined readers, and how social, political, and cultural factors have influenced topics such as childhood, family, and religion in &quot;classic&quot; and award-winning multicultural children's literature. By comparing literature with similar themes over time, we will explore how authors have positively reflected, challenged, or attempted to remain neutral in their writing about dominant social and cultural values and beliefs, especially those pertaining to race/racism, ethnic and cultural diversity, and equity and social justice. We will discuss literature within the context of historical and political events of when the work was published and consider how literature can be a reflection of a time-period and authors' political ideologies (Stephens, 1992; Sutherland, 1985). Finally, we will consider how literature can foster dialogue in K-8 classrooms to promote anti-racist counter-narratives and the seven themes of Catholic social teaching to develop children's understanding of their role in contributing to a more just, equitable, and humane world.
AFST 33102	In this course, we will challenge the single story/ies U.S. schools and curricula have told about books, characters, and cultural groups by focusing on literature by and about people from various populations that have been traditionally underrepresented in the United States. We will discuss young adult literature from parallel cultures (including possible works by and about African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino/as, Native Americans, Middle Eastern Americans, and other ethnic groups), as well as literature by and about populations traditionally defined by class, religion, ability, gender and sexuality. Course participants will investigate theoretical perspectives, issues, controversies, and educational implications for these texts, including race and racism, whiteness and privilege (in society and in the educational system), and critical literacy. As an extension of the course, we will also examine the young adult literature market and how contemporary media may reinforce or resist the stereotypes, labels, and single stories associated with these cultures. Possible texts include All American Boys, American Born Chinese (graphic novel), a Jacqueline Woodson novel, Openly Straight, a canonical text like To Kill a Mockingbird, Every Day, and several choice options, including a Classic/Newberry text, one text representing a non-abled bodied protagonist, and one contemporary text.
AFST 40117	To imagine is to form a mental concept of something which is not present to the senses. Imagination therefore deals with &quot;framing&quot;.  Like everyone else, Africans ponder over their condition and their world on the basis of their experience, history, social location and other realities which provide the &quot;frame&quot; through which they construct and address reality. In this course, through the study of some significant African literary works and some literary works about Africa we  will study the self-perception of  the African and the way the African has ethically viewed his / her reality and tried to grapple with it over a period of time  (colonialism, post colonialism, apartheid)  with regard to various issues on the continent (political challenges, religion, war and peace) and over  some  of the social questions (class, urbanization/ city life, sex and sexuality, relationship of the sexes), etc. We will read such authors as Joseph Conrad, Amos Tutuola,  Chinua Achebe, Athol Fugard, Wole Soyinka, Cyprian Ekwensi, Chimamanda Adichie, Syl Cheney-Coker, Tsitsi Dangaremga, Nawal El Sadawi, Ferdinand Oyono , and some others. Using these and many authors we will ask questions about what constitutes the moral imagination, how such an imagination is manifested in or apparent in the social, personal and religious lives of the various African peoples or characters portrayed in these literary works; to what extent the moral sense has helped/ conditioned or failed to influence the lives of these peoples and characters. We will also inquire into the extent and in what ways the writers in our selection have helped to shape the moral imagination of their people.
AFST 40711	Scholars and activists use the concept of the &quot;carceral state&quot; to describe the official, government use of policing, surveillance, and mass imprisonment to exercise control over society. This course examines the histories, cultures, politics, and economics of prisons and policing in the United States, in order to determine how the U.S. carceral state has been a factor in the social construction of race, gender, and citizenship.   We will study the genealogy of the U.S. carceral state -- beginning with the surveillance embedded in the earliest practices of slavery and settler colonialism, tracing its development through the 19th and early 20th centuries, and concluding with the rise of the modern prison industrial complex. We will then focus on contemporary U.S. prisons, policing, and surveillance, using case studies including the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; immigrant detention, sex-crime regulation, and police violence. Finally, we will consider alternatives to prisons and policing, as we learn about academic research and activist movements working to end state and police violence, abolish prisons, and create opportunities for restorative justice.   Over the course of the semester, students will learn about the historical development and ongoing maintenance of the carceral state, using an intersectional framework that highlights the ways in which prisons and policing have both shaped, and been shaped by, race, gender, citizenship, and economics. Along the way, students will ask and address such questions as: How does the U.S. carceral state function as a tool for social control? What histories, policies, and ideologies underlie the carceral state? How have individuals and organizations worked to transform or abolish the carceral state? How have art and cultural production been used to normalize and/or critique the carceral state? And can we imagine a world without prisons or police?
AFST 41675	This five-week course will examine forced migration from the perspective of the beliefs, teachings, and programmatic commitments of faith communities. The first week will be devoted to identifying the causes of and global trends in forced migration, as well as the categories of forced migrants. It will also explore the “law of migration”; that is, the diverse legal systems that migrants must negotiate on their journeys and that religious actors use to assess migration policies. The second week will explore the teachings of diverse faith communities on forced migration, their understanding of this immense and growing phenomenon, and their programmatic and policy responses. The third week will segue to state-centered approaches to the governance and management of migration, with a focus on the concepts of sovereignty and the rule of law. It will also consider ideologies such as nativism and exclusionary nationalism that are in tension with the beliefs, policy positions, and programs of religious actors. The fourth week will be devoted to guest speakers and student presentations on situations of protracted displacement throughout the world. Persons in protracted displacement have lived in exile for at least five years and have no viable course out of their “long lasting and intractable status of limbo.” The fifth week will be devoted to US refugee protection trends and policies.
AFST 43102	Is it possible to think of the 21st century as a post-racial, post-feminist world? In her provocative 2012 study, Body as Evidence: Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender, Janell Hobson suggests that rather than having been eradicated, millennial hopes that the historical difficulties represented by race and gender have lost their significance in the present day are as far, if not even further away from the mark as they have ever been. For Hobson, policing the body, whether that be in terms of its race, its gender, or its sexuality, has remained paramount. &quot;[W]hile the early-twenty-first century discourse of 'postracial' and 'postfeminist' often declares the loss of meaning attached to race and gender,&quot; she argues, &quot;..the global scope of our media-reliant information culture insists on perpetuating raced and gendered meanings that support ideologies of dominance, privilege, and power.&quot; In Hobson's view, the body and how it is imagined rests at the center of such ideologies, pointing also to a number of crucial questions that become particularly important when considering the significance of race and gender through the lens of modernity. How might a reconsideration of race point also to a rethinking of gender and vice-versa? What does race actually mean? How does/can it alter the way we understand gender? Is it possible to think race beyond the idea of race? What might a new conception of race actually look like, and how might this influence our thinking on gender? How are the problems of race and gender intertwined, and how is/has the body been imagined in and through them? What can such questions tell us about today's racial and gendered realities, both inside and outside the university, both in the past and the present? This course takes a step backward to investigate these and other like questions in the context of the utopic impulse and its emphasis on the imagination in several 19th-century American authors whose work may be viewed as participating in a broad yet under-acknowledged vision of race, gender and Atlantic modernity that seeks to interrogate hierarchies of race and gender as these have been constructed and maintained within dominant ideologies. Grounding our analysis in a number of 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century political philosophical texts on law and utopia and drawing on insights from critical race theory, gender studies, feminist theory, theories of law and literature, and utopian studies, our goal will be to gain a more nuanced understanding of our racialized past and its troubled link to questions of gender both then and now, so that we may better hope to imagine - and reimagine - the shape of our collective democratic future in the 21st century's global community
AFST 43644	This course undertakes a broad examination of black politics in multiracial America. Racial issues have provoked crises in American politics; changes in racial status have prompted American political institutions to operate in distinctive ways. The course examines the interface of black politics with and within the American political system. How successful have blacks been as they attempted to penetrate the electoral system in the post civil rights era. What conflicts and controversies have arisen as African Americans have sought to integrate the American system of power. Now that the laws have been changed to permit limited integration, should African Americans integrate politically, that is should they attempt to 'deracialize' their political appeals and strategy, with an effort to &quot;crossover politically;&quot; are some approaches such as those of President Barack Obama &quot;not black enough?&quot; What internal political challenges do African Americans face; some such as the increasing importance of class and socioeconomic factors, as well as gender and sexuality may reshape the definition of the black community. What intellectual challenges and strategic choices are they facing as the American population has grown increasingly multiracial. Finally, in light of these demographic changes in American life and American politics, how stable will past patterns of political participation, and political organizations and institutions of African American politics remain.

ALHN 33000	The course, which explores the films of Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, serves two main purposes. First, it introduces students to film as a distinctive art form. Students will become familiar with the questions and categories with which one can most meaningfully interpret and evaluate any film, including film-specific dimensions. Like theater, film is a visual, temporal, and linguistic medium, but film differs from theater insofar as it is defined by camera or shot, which frames our sight; montage or editing, which allows film to be spatially and temporally discontinuous; and mis-en-scene, the totality of expressive content in the filmed image, from setting, props, and costumes to gestures, facial expressions, and lighting. Together these three elements bring forward not only a distinctive art form but also an unusually capacious and creative ontology. Second, we will consider the ways in which Hitchcock's works raise questions and convey meaning. Although Hitchcock is justly famous for eliciting powerful emotions, he is also a cerebral director, whose works reflect on art and its relation to reality. Power and love are the two great intersubjective themes that dominate Hitchcock's concept of the social world. His films play with identity, mistaken identity, and identity crises. Hitchcock stresses the difficulties of achieving certainty in intersubjective relations and the various ways in which we try to navigate this uncertainty, which can evoke fear, thwart love, enable evil, and hinder the revelation of truth. Hitchcock is also a Catholic director who thematizes the gap between what is and what ought to be. His assessment of a human impulse toward cruelty is nonetheless paired with concepts of grace and providence. Hitchcock plays with diverse genres, but his most distinctive mode may be humor, which represents a persistent but loving critique of an inadequate world. The course will be student-centered, with considerable focus on discussion. Students will write extensively on the films and thereby develop not only their interpretive but also their oral and written capacities.
ALHN 42351	This course builds upon the Senior Research Thesis colloquium taken in the fall. The spring colloquium consists of weekly meetings of Glynn seniors, in for the purpose of reading and offering feedback upon installments of individual students' theses.

ALSF 20255	Work plays a deeply important role in our lives. Finding good work -- which, for many of us, means getting a meaningful job you're passionate about -- can seem like the crucial factor in determining whether your life goes well or poorly, and whether you end up happy and fulfilled or miserable and empty. But things aren't nearly so simple. What kind of work is available to anyone in particular is largely determined by factors outside of our control. And when it comes to work, we're notoriously bad at predicting what aspects of a job we'll find meaningful and fulfilling, and which will drain us of life and energy. In this course, we will focus on the most urgent questions facing anyone trying to discern what their life's work will be, such as: - What causes alienation, anxiety, and burnout at work, and are these things that can be avoided with foresight and careful planning? - What is &quot;leisure&quot; (as contrasted with &quot;time off&quot;) and what role should it play if we want to be healthy, flourishing persons? Is there such a thing as &quot;work-life balance&quot;? - Do we live in a genuine meritocracy? And, if so, is this a good thing or a bad thing? How should we think about equity and equality in the workplace? - Is it dangerous (or perhaps wise) to see your work purely as an instrument of financial gain? Does work have the power to nurture (or destroy) your soul? The course will be organized by topic, and we'll read a broad range of thinkers from St. Benedict to Karl Marx and Max Weber to more contemporary thinkers like Alasdair MacIntyre, Michael Sandel, and David Graeber (author of the provocative book &quot;Bullshit Jobs&quot;). We'll also watch a lot of the TV show &quot; Survivor.&quot; Students will leave the course with their own &quot;philosophy of work,&quot; captured in a living document that details their core beliefs about the role of work in living a good life.
ALSF 30147	A generation ago, students looking to pursue careers in media were likely journalism or broadcasting majors who could aspire to master one platform and work for the same news company for decades. No more. People don't consume news in the ways they once did; the media landscape is changing. There are new challenges -- how to regulate misinformation, how to fund big investigative projects -- but also new opportunities. Digital tools are eliminating ‘start-up' barriers and giving storytellers more control over their fates. Aspiring news writers or producers no longer need to work their way up in a legacy company, hoping to someday catch their big break. You could manage a YouTube channel with thousands of subscribers from your dorm room. Some of you probably already do. But how do you monetize such ventures? How do you turn a side project or a cool idea into a career? In &quot;Media Entrepreneurship,&quot; we'll explore how you can combine your passion and skills - skills cultivated as a student of the liberal arts -- to capitalize on media's exciting new frontier. You'll gain the knowledge, tools, and confidence to see &quot;being your own boss&quot; or &quot;launching your own brand&quot; as a realistic career possibility. And it's not just about you. When you hear the word &quot;entrepreneur,&quot; you might think of a guy pitching an idea to venture capitalists on Shark Tank. But, at its best, media entrepreneurship is an act of service. It's about building trust, meeting community needs, and expanding whose voices we hear as a society. In this course, you'll practice conceiving of a media project and creating your own startup business plan. 
ALSF 30903	Policy Lab: Sustainable Finance (by Tara Kenney and Brendan Maher) This course will explore the role of global business in reducing poverty, inequality and attending to the needs of all stakeholders. Students will be introduced to the rapidly growing fields of impact investing and sustainable finance which support socially conscious and environmentally friendly innovations.  Students will gain a broad overview of the financial and economic tools available, beyond government assistance and philanthropy, to support broad based wealth creation, equality of opportunity and natural resource preservation. Students will be invited to participate in policy debates on certain topics and will read mini case studies on subjects such as microfinance, &quot;place based&quot; community investment and the role of CDFIs, and the issuance of green/blue sustainability bonds.  Guest speakers/practitioners will be invited to engage the students in real world problem solving. The course will culminate in a small group project or paper to &quot;reexamine business&quot; as a force for good, which will be presented in class. It is open to students of all intended majors with no prerequisites, and should serve as a foray to several future areas of study such as global affairs, social entrepreneurship and sustainability.
ALSF 32147	Students enrolled in Media Entrepreneurship must also register for a weekly discussion section. Students will participate in small group discussions, activities, and writing workshops as they work to envision and craft a business plan for their own media startup.
ALSF 33126	Students will participate in Sheedy Family Program enrichment opportunities, including dinners with guest speakers, a weekend-long fall retreat, writing bootcamps, and professional development events.

Students in the Sheedy Family Program will enroll in this 1-credit course concurrently with the gateway course &quot;Business in Context.&quot;
ALSF 43590	Economic actions like working, buying, selling, saving, and giving are a fundamental part of everyday life, and all spheres of society, from family to religion to politics, are interrelated with the economy. Sociologists examine how social relationships from small networks to transnational linkages affect economic actions and their outcomes, and the ways cultural meanings and political strategies shape those social relationships.  The goal of this class is to provide students with new perspectives on economic actions by reading recent sociological studies of topics like money, markets, work, businesses, industries, and consumer society.
ALSF 48001	Students in the Sheedy Family Program can apply for the Scholars track in the fall of their junior year. The Scholars track is designed for students who seek a more research-intensive experience in the Sheedy Family Program: likely students who envision graduate school in their future, or whose career preparation demands an in-depth analysis of a specific topic within the intersection of business and the liberal arts. Sheedy Scholars will hone interdisciplinary research skills and develop expertise on a subject of their choice - a subject that brings together questions, methods, and sources from business and the liberal arts.  The 1-credit Sheedy Honors Thesis course is designed to supplement any standard thesis writing courses or hours that Sheedy Scholars take within their majors during their senior year. The Sheedy Scholars meet as a cohort every other week to set goals, workshop drafts, and receive faculty feedback on their writing. Students on the Scholars Track should plan to enroll in the 1-credit course during both the fall and spring semesters of their senior year.
ALSF 48003	Students admitted to the Scholars Track of the Sheedy Family Program whose primary majors or departments do not offer them the option to write a senior thesis may enroll in thesis hours directly through the Sheedy Program. Eligible students should sign up for thesis hours in both the fall and spring of their senior year (3 credits each semester). Note that these hours count as general electives; although students will likely work with advisors from their primary departments, they should not plan to count the hours toward their major or minor.

AMST 30104	Feminism isn't only about women, nor is feminism only for women. Feminism is about power - about who has it and who doesn't. And in today's world, data is power. Data can be used to create communities, advance research, and expose injustice. But data can also be used to discriminate, marginalize, and surveil. This course will draw intersectional feminist theory and activism to identify models for challenging existing power differentials in data science, with the aim of using data science methods and tools to work towards justice. Class meetings will be split between discussions of theoretical readings and explorations of data science tools and methods (such as Tableau, RStudio, and Python). Those readings may include chapters from texts that include Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein's Data Feminism (2020), Virginia Eubanks's Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor (2018), Ruha Benjamin's Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code (2019), and Sasha Costanza-Chock's Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need (2020). This course will also examine the data advocacy and activism work undertaken by groups like Our Data Bodies, Data for Black Lives, the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, and Chicago-based Citizens Police Data Project. Over the course of the semester, students will develop original research projects that use data to intervene in issues of inequality and injustice.     This course is not about gaining mastery of particular data science tools or methods, therefore familiarity with statistical analysis or data science tools (R, RStudio, Python, etc.) is NOT a prerequisite for this course.
AMST 30108	This course offers a broad thematic overview of the history of capitalism from the early sixteenth century up to the late 1980s. As a discussion-based seminar, we will devote most of our conversations to discovering, analyzing and reflecting on the transformation of the U.S. from a newly-independent British colony, to the most influential economic power in the world. Topics and themes we will consider include: the rise of early modern transnational capitalism, European imperialism and trade, and indigenous dispossession after 1492; science and technological transformations; social and economic thought; slavery and servitude, broadly construed; and characteristics of prosperity, wealth, and economic flux.     Our readings and viewings will be a mix of scholarly and primary sources, including an abundance of canonical literary and artistic material, such as novels, visual art, and film excerpts (e.g. Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House (1879), Aaron Douglas's Building More Stately Mansions (1944), and Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence (1920)). Over the course of the semester, students will draw upon this eclectic combination of sources to synthesize the dominant historical dimensions of capitalism in and beyond the U.S. via four short essays (4 - 5 pages, double-spaced-between 1,100 and 1,400 words), and a final paper (10 - 12 pages, double-spaced) based on cumulative texts.
AMST 30112	The purpose of this interdisciplinary course is twofold: to examine the social context and cultural change of the sixties and to explore the various journalistic and aesthetic representations of events, movements, and transformations.  We will focus on the manner in which each writer or artist witnessed the sixties and explore fresh styles of writing and cultural expression, such as the new journalism popularized by Tom Wolfe and the music/lyrics performed by Bob Dylan.  Major topics for consideration include the counterculture and the movement--a combination of civil rights and anti-war protests.
AMST 30113	With help from athletes such as Billie Jean King, Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James, Serena Williams, and Megan Rapinoe, Americans are growing accustomed to thinking about sports as embedded in the politics of gender, class, race, sexuality, and the nation. Consider the variety of places where sports happen, however, and the ways we develop and consume those places, and it becomes apparent that sports are also environmental in significant and complex ways. This course will examine the environmental politics of sports from conservation to climate change through the lenses of history and cultural studies. Course content will range from 19th century hunting, Indigenous surfing, and BASE jumping, to pick-up basketball, pro stadiums, and Notre Dame Athletics. Topical sections include outdoor sports and conservation, mountain sports and public land use, parks and recreation, stadiums and environmental justice, sports and climate change, and sustainability in the NCAA. Course requirements include regular reading and discussion, midterm and final essays, and a research project on a topic of the student's choice.
AMST 30119	This class will survey the various historical and contemporary dimensions of Asian American experiences including immigration &amp; integration, family &amp; community dynamics, ethnic/gender/class identity, as well as transnational and diasporic experiences. We will explore contemporary and historical issues of racism, the model minority myth, inter-generational relationships, and the educational experiences of Asian Americans. To accomplish this, our class will pose such questions as: Who is Asian American? How did racism create Chinatown? Is there an Asian advantage? Coursework includes essays based on topics of your choice, presentations, and a creative narrative.
AMST 30133	This course traces the history of Buddhism in the United States since the nineteenth century.  After considering the history of Asian immigrants who brought Buddhism with them and American-born converts who embraced it here, we take some steps toward a cultural history of Buddhism in the US since 1945, analyzing the tradition's influence on other faiths and on politics, activism, fiction, poetry, painting, video art, film, music, architecture, martial arts, how-to literature, psychology, and medicine.
AMST 30136	A generation ago, students looking to pursue careers in media were likely journalism or broadcasting majors who could aspire to master one platform and work for the same news company for decades. No more. People don't consume news in the ways they once did; the media landscape is changing. There are new challenges -- how to regulate misinformation, how to fund big investigative projects -- but also new opportunities. Digital tools are eliminating ‘start-up' barriers and giving storytellers more control over their fates. Aspiring news writers or producers no longer need to work their way up in a legacy company, hoping to someday catch their big break. You could manage a YouTube channel with thousands of subscribers from your dorm room. Some of you probably already do. But how do you monetize such ventures? How do you turn a side project or a cool idea into a career? In &quot;Media Entrepreneurship,&quot; we'll explore how you can combine your passion and skills - skills cultivated as a student of the liberal arts -- to capitalize on media's exciting new frontier. You'll gain the knowledge, tools, and confidence to see &quot;being your own boss&quot; or &quot;launching your own brand&quot; as a realistic career possibility. And it's not just about you. When you hear the word &quot;entrepreneur,&quot; you might think of a guy pitching an idea to venture capitalists on Shark Tank. But, at its best, media entrepreneurship is an act of service. It's about building trust, meeting community needs, and expanding whose voices we hear as a society. In this course, you'll practice conceiving of a media project and creating your own startup business plan.
AMST 30141	Native Americans have long been trapped in a betwixt and between state, caught by the forces of past and present, tradition and assimilation, romanticization and caricature. Yet through it all, Native voices have continued to speak of the Indian experience with great power and eloquence. This course will introduce Native American literature as a distinctive contribution to American and world literature. We will examine a wide range of expressive culture from the last century, including novels, poetry, graphic stories, children's literature, film, digital media, autobiographies, performances of oral literature, and music. Through the passion, creativity, and humor of Indian authors, we will learn something of the historical experience of Native men and women, and how they have reacted to massacres and mascots, racism and reservations, poverty and political oppression. Above all, we will try to understand how indigenous authors have used literature to engage crucial issues of race and culture in the United States that continue to influence their lives: identity, self-discovery, the centrality of place, cultural survival, and the healing power of language and spirituality. Class discussions will incorporate literary, historical, and ethnographic perspectives of Native expressive culture and the agency of authors as artists and activists vis-à-vis the wider American literary tradition. Authors include Sherman Alexie, Nicholas Black Elk, Louise Erdrich, D'Arcy McNickle, N. Scott Momaday, Linda Hogan, Winona LaDuke, and Leonard Peltier.
AMST 30144	In 1975, the African-American writer Ishmael Reed put culture at the center of politics: “If I have you revering my art, behaving like me and adopting my psychology, then I’ve got you. If I’ve got your head, I’ve got you.” Confronted with the whiteness of U.S. publishing and school curricula, Reed and his peers saw literature as a key front in this broader struggle over the making and unmaking of American identity. Yet the question of literature’s contribution to the struggle elicited stark disagreement. Would it counter racial stereotype with accurate representation or refuse the burden of racial representativeness? Would it lay claim to the American nation on behalf of the racially minoritized, or throw in with different political horizons? Would it address the white reader unfamiliar with the realities of racial oppression, or the non-white reader seeking a different relation to histories already lived? These disagreements would only intensify in the following decades as the call for multicultural representation became increasingly institutionalized – with syllabi and publishing undergoing modest diversification, and universities framing racial difference as a strategic asset.   Moving from the late 20th century to the present, our course attends to how these political ambitions and desires informed the writing, publishing, and teaching of American literature by writers of color. It asks how these authors not only engaged in activism by literary means, but also reckoned with the artistic and political dilemmas that attended this doubled pursuit. To this end, the bulk of our readings will draw from literary fiction, non-fiction, and poetry, including authors like Gloria Anzaldua, Paul Beatty, Maxine Hong Kingston, Viet Thanh Nguyen, and Wendy Trevino.
AMST 30145	Nearly one in four people is an immigrant or child of immigrants in the United States. This course critically examines what it means to be an immigrant or child of immigrants through interdisciplinary sources, including memoirs, blogs, art, and popular journalism. Since the liberalization of immigration policy in 1965, immigrants from Latin America and Asia are becoming an increasing and emergent demographic of American society. In major American cities such as Los Angeles and New York, they comprise over 50% of the population. This course focuses on how immigrants and the children of immigrants experience the United States. How are immigrants changing the US racial and ethnic structure? How do their experiences differ, given varying legal statuses? How is the second generation becoming American? We will explore these questions through family, media representation, religion, education, dating, and sexuality. Students will participate in a service-learning opportunity related to migration and social justice and learn skills in quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Service learning will be 2-3 hours outside of class each week.
AMST 30146	This course will consider the roles of persuasion, commentary, and criticism in contemporary American culture and will explore the techniques of these forms of expression. Students will prepare and discuss their own writing assignments, including opinion columns, editorials, and critical reviews of performances or books. Ethics and responsibilities in contemporary American journalism in expression of opinions also will be explored. Assignments will serve as the examinations in this course, which is taught by a political columnist for the &lt;i&gt;South Bend Tribune&lt;/i&gt; who also serves as host of public affairs programs on WNIT-TV, Public Broadcasting.  Open to American Studies majors and Journalism, Ethics, and Democracy minors by permission.  Other applicants must submit writing samples for review.
AMST 30148	Whether it is controversies about the removal of statues, bans on teaching the New York Times’s The 1619 Project, critiques of the musical Hamilton, or originalist interpretations of the United States Constitution, early America seems to have gained new prominence in debates about the present-day United States. But why does this period—which spans four centuries from approximately 1450 to 1850—hold such meaning today? And what does this history have to teach us about our present moment? In this class, we will learn about the vast, diverse, and complex world of early America and use this knowledge to better understand current issues and events. Like Americans today, early Americans dealt with pandemics, racial injustice, political corruption, and income inequality. They adapted to changing markets, globalization, and climate change. What do their experiences have to teach us about navigating these issues in our own time
AMST 30150	This course aims to change the way you think not only about the way that we play games, but also about the way that video games teach their players to behave within their digital worlds. This course will encourage students to reflect on and utilize their lived experiences as players, and utilize these experiences to locate themselves within their analysis and writing as well as their design practices. This course will undertake an intensive, interdisciplinary focus on the history of video game development, representation in video games, and the languages that digital games work in as well as decolonial theory and diverse theories of design. This class will engage with a variety of scholarly texts, video games, media posts, videos, and design exercises, in order to illustrate the ways in which video games have shaped the ways we play, think, and behave within their spaces. Students will be required to write and design around these lessons and address and push back against the problematic behaviors and colonial narratives around violence, race, gender, sexuality, and relationship to the land that these gamic languages and lessons have created. 
AMST 30154	The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 26% of Americans (about 61 million people) have a disability—a physical, intellectual, sensory, or self-care impediment that affects major life activities. This course considers this population, their stories and experiences, as well as how disability—as a social, cultural, legal, and political construct—has shaped the nation and its history. A particular focus of the course will be on disability and social justice. Throughout American history, and still today, disabled people have been excluded from basic civil rights, such as voting, marrying, holding property, and living independently. This course will examine how these restrictions developed and changed over time as well as how disabled people have fought for greater access and equality. Coursework may include response papers, primary source analysis, and a final project.
AMST 30169	While it is a notoriously difficult concept to define, &quot;race&quot; is undoubtedly a powerful force in American life. Focusing on the late nineteenth century to the present, this course examines the ways in which racial ideas are formed, negotiated, and resisted in the arenas of American literature and popular culture. From the story of racial confusion in Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson (1894) to contemporary cultural politics of performance and appropriation, this course will ask how popular culture actively shapes—rather than merely reflects—American ideas about race and ethnicity.  A key aim of the class is to go beyond looking for &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; pop culture texts to explore the deeper meanings of racism and antiracism.  By closely engaging with a diverse set of theoretical, historical, and primary texts, students will learn to approach and analyze popular culture with a critical eye.
AMST 30177	America, at its core, is an idea.  The lands that became America have been imagined and in certain ways and constantly reimagined. The history of the ideas that made America is less a lesson in philosophy and more about a series of clashes between contending visions: Democracy vs. Republicanism; Free vs. Slave; Christian vs. Secular; Individual vs. Society; and Universal vs. Particular. This course traces a long arc from the Puritans to the Culture Wars to understand the ideas Americans draw upon to comprehend the world and act in it.Lectures and discussions will consider the notions of equality, democracy, pluralism, religious freedom, and the tensions between contending visions for America.  Readings for this course will include autobiographies, speeches, sermons, canonical texts, lyrics, novels, newspaper articles, and poetry.
AMST 30183	Applied Multimedia for Journalists - The main focus of this course is that students will learn how to shoot and edit videos.  It will briefly touch on how to produce audio stories and podcasts. Students will also study the legal and ethical issues surrounding the use, creation and publication of digital media.  The use of drones and the legal issues surrounding them will also be discussed.
AMST 30272	Inclusion and exclusion, tradition and change, identity and difference: In this survey course, we will track these fundamental dynamics through American literature since 1865, analyzing how such forces helped shape the form and content of literary works. Proceeding from an understanding of US literature as ineluctably multiracial and polyvocal, our historically grounded units will bring us through Reconstruction, realism and naturalism, modernism, midcentury social movements (including the Black freedom movement and mobilizations for women's and LGBTQ liberation), postmodern crises of narrative, and contemporary engagements with the past that never really goes away. We will read novels, short stories, poems, and essays, and we'll also attend to popular music and other emergent forms of art and media that suffuse US literature since 1865. Texts will include works by Charles Chesnutt, W.E.B. Du Bois, Henry James, Jack London, T.S. Eliot, Gertrude Stein, James Baldwin, Thomas Pynchon, Toni Morrison, Jennifer Egan, and many others.
AMST 30295	In this course, we will deploy critical and creative modes of inquiry as we undertake a survey of mid- to late-twentieth-century American poetry arising from New York City, which in the postwar period became a nexus of literary and artistic experimentation. It is within this geographic and historical framework that the New York School of Poets coalesced around the core figures of Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, Barbara Guest, and James Schuyler. Focusing on this dynamic array of poets as well as their precursors (e.g., Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein, Federico García Lorca), fellow travelers (e.g., Allen Ginsberg, Amiri Baraka, Frank Lima), and subsequent &quot;generations&quot; of New York poets (e.g., Joe Brainard, Bernadette Mayer, John Yau), we will consider how lines of affinity and intimacy, as well as the cultural reverberations of the city,drew together writers so diverse in outlook and method that Ashbery remarked, &quot;our program is the absence of any program.&quot; In this light, to figure out what it means to be part of this anti-programmatic community, we will explore how the New York School intersected with the Beats, the Black Arts Movement, the Boston and San Francisco Renaissances, the Nuyorican Movement, and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Poetry - prompting us to consider how the concept of an avant-garde becomes, in this period, a ramifying network of friends, lovers, and intellectual rivals engaged in aesthetic cross-pollination. Our undertaking will be attentive to the intermedial dialogue between these poets and New York painters (e.g., Willem de Kooning, Fairfield Porter, Jane Freilicher), methods of collaboration, the influence of postmodern theory, and how race, gender, sexuality, and place shaped what has been cited as one of the most enduringly influential bodies of literature in the postwar world. Assignments will engage students' critical and creative talents.
AMST 30313	This course offers an introduction to the history of the United States from Reconstruction through the First World War with particular emphasis on the social, cultural, and intellectual formations of the period. The United States made a dramatic transition in these years: from a predominantly agrarian and rural society to an urban, industrial society and imperial, world power. It is also said that in this period, a new, national, and distinctly modern culture emerged. We will test the merits of this claim and attempt to understand how Americans grappled with these broad transformations by examining the history of social formations, including class, race, and gender, together with the history of cultural formations - American popular culture, the adaptations of bourgeois culture, and the creation of mass culture. In reading sources such as short stories, poetry, political speeches, and novels, and analyzing photography, film, advertising, and architecture, we will explore the making of a modern America.
AMST 30321	This course is an introduction to the new field of environmental history. While many people think &quot;The Environment&quot; suddenly became important with the first &quot;Earth Day&quot; in 1970 (or a few years earlier), environmental issues have in fact long been of central importance. In recent decades historians have begun actively to explore the past sensibilities of various groups toward their surroundings and fellow creatures. They have also increasingly paid attention to the ways environmental factors have affected history. This course will range widely, from world history to the story of a single river, from arguments about climate change to the significance of pink flamingos, and will survey a number of types of history including cultural, demographic, religious, and animal.
AMST 30331	Through intensive reading and writing students will explore the social and cultural history of America's most costly war. We will focus on various topics as they relate to the war: antebellum origins, religion, gender, Lincoln's reasons for waging war, dead bodies, freedmen's families, black soldiers, and the uses of war memory. This will not be a guns-and-generals-smell-the-smoke course, though knowledge of military matters can be helpful. We will ask and try to answer who really &quot;won&quot; and &quot;lost&quot; the war.
AMST 30393	This course traces the development of consumer society in the United States from the colonial era through the late twentieth century. It asks how Americans came to define the &quot;good life&quot; as one marked by material abundance and how transformations in buying and selling have shaped American culture, politics, and national identity. One of our aims will be to develop a usable historical definition of consumer society and to evaluate when such a society emerged in the United States. We will examine the role that consumption has played in defining and policing ideals of gender, race, sexuality, and class. We will also consider how Americans have used consumer practices and spaces to advance political claims and notions of citizenship. The course is organized around key turning points in American consumer capitalism: the consumer boom of the eighteenth century; the market revolution and feminization of consumption; the birth of the department store; the rise of mass consumption and commercial leisure; the development of modern advertising and sales; the spread of chain stores and shopping malls; and the globalization of American consumer culture. In addition to recent scholarship and text-based primary sources, we will analyze artifacts of consumer culture, such as advertisements, catalogs, product labels, broadsides, film, and television.
AMST 30428	The United States is the most powerful state in the world today. Its actions are important not just for US citizens, but they also affect whether others go to war, whether they will win their wars, whether they receive economic aid, whether they will go broke, or whether they will starve. What determines US foreign policy? What is the national interest? When do we go to war? Would you send US soldiers into war? If so, into which wars and for what reasons? How do our economic policies affect others? Does trade help or hurt the US economy and its citizens? We first study several theories about foreign policy. We then examine the US foreign policy process, including the President, Congress, the bureaucracy, the media, and public opinion. To see how this all works, we turn to the history of US foreign policy, from Washington's farewell address through the World Wars and the Cold War to the Gulf War. We then study several major issue areas, including weapons of mass destruction, trade and economics, and the environment. Finally, we develop and debate forecasts and strategies for the future.
AMST 30431	This course introduces students to the dynamics of the social and historical construction of race and ethnicity in American political life. The course explores the following core questions: What are race and ethnicity? What are the best ways to think about the impact of race and ethnicity on American citizens? What is the history of racial and ethnic formation in American political life? How do race and ethnicity link up with other identities animating political actions like gender and class? What role do American political institutions the Congress, presidency, judiciary, state and local governments, etc. play in constructing and maintaining these identity categories? Can these institutions ever be used to overcome the points of division in American society?
AMST 30454	This course is not for the faint of heart, but will explore the feint, adept, and deft use of Civics and History courses to try and create one ideal American narrative in K-12 classrooms. History in American K-12 classrooms and beyond is always political! Historical thinking is also supposed to be an active way of learning and establishing new ideas when there are new pieces of information or additional epistemologies not a passive regurgitation of facts. Join this class to struggle with how a more representative curriculum might help foster better-rounded citizens and broader critical thinking skills. Historical narratives created and true are installed in American curricula to create ‘good citizens,’ but who determines what ‘good’ is and who and what ‘citizens’ are is an ever-changing pantheon of characters seeking god-like power over the nation’s past, with aspirations of helping shape and control the nation’s future. This course examines how historical events are molded and taught in curricula in different eras and shows the evolution of textbooks and curriculum firsthand. Students explore how early textbooks think of Native peoples as &quot;Noble Savages&quot; and how that ‘nobility’ disappears in later texts. We’ll have the opportunity to study the re-shaping of ethnic identities in the United States History curriculum and how the Cold War not only re-configures the size and orientation of the maps in our history books but also how the stories of other nations and their forms of government become commonplace slurs as a way to whip up righteousness for US policies in the Cold War and to quash rising ideologies connected to labor movements and those other nations simultaneously. We’ll examine the rise and righteousness of both sides of the current debate over Critical Race Theory in the K-12 classroom and so much more. You will have the opportunity to explore additional historical narratives of Native peoples and many different groups who immigrants by choice, force, and forced annexations and their representations in curricula. This course recognizes the privileges that race, class, and gender has played in creating the historical narrative for K-12 classrooms through the study of the groups who make decisions about what civics and historical lessons are taught to students in American schools in different eras. This course will have writing and research elements go through multiple drafts and the final version of student works is not just academic in nature but is to demonstrate that you can utilize your knowledge and understanding for the good, to in essence show ‘what you are fighting for’ in the parlance of all at Notre Dame working to bring academic thinking to the forefront for the common good. This course will require critical thinking, creative solutions and ideas on curricular philosophy, great classroom participation, a willingness to do original historical research, and a tremendous desire to share.
AMST 30460	This course will examine the Latino experience in the United States, including the historical, cultural, and political foundations of Latino life. We will approach these topics comparatively, thus attention will be given to the various experiences of a multiplicity of Latino groups in the United States. This course has an optional community-engaged learning component with La Casa de Amistad.
AMST 30463	This course will examine the opportunities and challenges facing Latino communities today as they simultaneously transform and are transformed by their continuing growth in U.S. society.  Through a careful examination of the biographies of leaders in Latino communities, we will examine what role they have each played in empowering Latino communities to advance in business, arts, education, community organizing, entertainment, medicine, religion, law, academia, politics, and other areas.  The course will coincide with the Transformative Latino Leadership Speaker Series sponsored by the Arthur Foundation through the Institute for Latino Studies.  Students in the class will have the opportunity to interact with invited leaders in several setting including the classroom, meals, receptions, and university-wide events.  The primary course requirement is a research essay about the life and career of a chosen leader.
AMST 30468	This course surveys the basic institutions and practices of American politics. The goal of the course is to gain a more systematic understanding of American politics that will help you become better informed and more articulate. The course examines the institutional and constitutional framework of American politics and identifies the key ideas needed to understand politics today. The reading and writing assignments have been designed not only to inform you, but also to help develop your analytic and research skills. The themes of the course include the logic and consequences of the separation of powers, the build-in biases of institutions and procedures, the origins and consequence of political reforms, and recent changes in American politics in the 21st century. This semester we will emphasize the significance of the upcoming 2016 elections, and the course will include election-related assignments. Although the course counts toward the Political Science major and will prepare prospective majors for further study of American politics, its primary aim is to introduce students of all backgrounds and interests to the information, ideas, and academic skills that will enable them to understand American politics better and help them become more thoughtful and responsible citizens.
AMST 30500	Race is often thought of as a biological characteristic of individuals. Yet research consistently demonstrates that race, rather than a biological reality, is a social reality. This course will introduce you to how to think sociologically about race and racism. We will explore the origins of race, and the theoretical and empirical analysis of race, ethnicity, and immigration. We will also examine patterns of racial/ethnic inequality in a variety of domains including education, income and wealth, criminal justice, media, and health. Throughout the course we will view race through an intersectional lens, emphasizing the interplay between social categories such as race, ethnicity, gender, and social class. We will also discuss immigration patterns and how they affect race and ethnic relations. While we will talk about historical and global processes and patterns, most of the class will focus on racial and ethnic stratification in contemporary U.S. society (post-1960s).
AMST 30501	Given the dramatic rise in mass incarceration over the last 50 years, understanding the spillover consequences of this uniquely American phenomenon has become increasingly important as a growing number of families now have direct experience with imprisonment. This course will provide a broad overview of the ripple effects of mass imprisonment on family life and how it shapes opportunity and structures disadvantage for communities, families, and especially children. This will be done through 1) exposure to mixed-media portrayals of imprisonment’s effects on family and community life and 2) the close analysis of empirical research on the spillover and intergenerational consequences of incarceration across a range of outcomes. With the concentration of imprisonment falling among poor, minority families, much of the readings in this course will focus on family life in urban communities of color, however, we will spend a little time exploring broader accounts, including those of rural communities and encourage students to consider impacts for families exposed to incarceration due to white-collar crimes.
AMST 30703	Television has been widely available in the United States for only half a century, yet already it has become a key means through which we understand our culture.   Our course examines this vital medium from three perspectives.  First, we will look at the industrial, economic and technological forces that have shaped U.S. television since its inception.  These factors help explain how U.S. television adopted the format of advertiser-supported broadcast networks and why this format is changing today.  Second, we will explore television's role in American social and political life: how TV has represented cultural changes in the areas of gender, class, race and ethnicity. Third, we will discuss specific narrative and visual strategies that characterize program formats.  Throughout the semester we will demonstrate how television and U.S. culture mutually influence one another, as television both constructs our view of the world and is affected by social and cultural forces within the U.S.
AMST 30705	This course aims to accomplish the following: 1) to develop students' understanding of the Cold War and its major political developments; 2) to develop students' understanding of the ways sports and society influence and reflect political developments; 3) to see sports programs as a reflection of the nation-states in which they develop, and to use athletic traditions in different nations to develop students' understanding of different societies; 4) to improve students' ability to use contemporary periodical sources in historical research; and 5) to improve students' analytical reading and writing skills through readings, exams, and a paper.
AMST 30761	Scholars and activists use the concept of the &quot;carceral state&quot; to describe the official, government use of policing, surveillance, and mass imprisonment to exercise control over society. This course examines the histories, cultures, politics, and economics of prisons and policing in the United States, in order to determine how the U.S. carceral state has been a factor in the social construction of race, gender, and citizenship.   We will study the genealogy of the U.S. carceral state -- beginning with the surveillance embedded in the earliest practices of slavery and settler colonialism, tracing its development through the 19th and early 20th centuries, and concluding with the rise of the modern prison industrial complex. We will then focus on contemporary U.S. prisons, policing, and surveillance, using case studies including the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; immigrant detention, sex-crime regulation, and police violence. Finally, we will consider alternatives to prisons and policing, as we learn about academic research and activist movements working to end state and police violence, abolish prisons, and create opportunities for restorative justice.   Over the course of the semester, students will learn about the historical development and ongoing maintenance of the carceral state, using an intersectional framework that highlights the ways in which prisons and policing have both shaped, and been shaped by, race, gender, citizenship, and economics. Along the way, students will ask and address such questions as: How does the U.S. carceral state function as a tool for social control? What histories, policies, and ideologies underlie the carceral state? How have individuals and organizations worked to transform or abolish the carceral state? How have art and cultural production been used to normalize and/or critique the carceral state? And can we imagine a world without prisons or police?
AMST 30904	This course will focus on exercises, research and reading from a diverse range of historical and current influential environmental writings from philosophers, economists, environmentalists, theologians, political scientists, naturalists, and practitioners. Learners will analyze the impact that human actions have on the natural world–particularly through foodways, or the social, cultural, and economic practices of producing and consuming food. This course will also explore how our understanding of race/ethnicity, nature, and the environment influences human choices around food. And it offers alternative courses of action toward viable, ethical, and antiracist solutions to questions about sustainable farming, global economic inequality, and world hunger. Throughout the semester, participants will use the lens of race and ethnicity to study and discuss how these two concepts affect access to agricultural land, foodstuffs/ foodways, environmental justice and nature. A fundamental objective will be to create podcasts focused on student’s engagement with the course themes.
AMST 30954	In 1964, when Martha Reeves sang, &quot;Calling out around the world/Are you ready for a brand new beat?/Summer's here and the time is right/For dancing in the street,&quot; was she beckoning listeners to join a party or the civil rights struggle? Or both? From spirituals sung by enslaved workers to protest anthems shouted at union rallies, music has provided the soundtrack to social justice causes throughout American History. Whether performed by rank-and-file reformers or famous recording artists -- from Frank Sinatra to Nina Simone to Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, and beyond -- popular music has accompanied and sometimes fueled transformations in American politics, culture, and social life. In this course students will explore American popular music in its many forms -- blues, country, jazz, folk, rock, punk, disco, hip hop, tejano, and more -- to understand its power and limits as both a force for social change and a window into major themes of the American experience.
AMST 30992	This course provides an introduction to the history of American slavery. After examining the origins and transformation of Atlantic world slavery, the courses focuses particularly upon slavery in the United States. Between the American Revolution and the Civil War, the United States grew into the largest slaveholding society in the modern world. U.S. slavery's growth was driven forward by massive global economic transformations and territorial conquest. Yet, in the face of unprecedented violence, enslaved people themselves brought about the end of slavery and transformed the meaning of freedom in the United States. This course focuses upon this history from the perspective of enslaved people themselves with particular attention to struggles for freedom. Through an examination of this history and its legacies, the course will introduce students to histories of  resistance.
AMST 30993	Civil Rights in the US is a living tradition that students can both understand and engage with. This course traces the non-linear, contested and ongoing history of Civil Rights in the US from the founding period to the present. It employs the perspectives of a lawyer and historian to illustrate how: the Civil War and the end of slavery made Civil Rights in the US possible, international human rights and Civil Rights in the US have interacted over time; the complicated relationship between the definition of Civil Rights and the realization of these rights played out over time, and the tensions between the federal government and the states continue to shape Civil Rights down to the present. The course is structured around three key historical periods in which Civil Rights in the US developed and the divisive legacy of these periods of possibility: The Founding and Constitutional period 1776-1790, Civil War and Reconstruction, 1863-1883 and the Civil Rights Era 1945-1991. Through an examination of social movements, Supreme Court cases, and congressional action the course illustrates how the meaning of citizenship and civil rights, who constituted a citizen, and what institutions—state and local government, private individuals, and so on—posed the biggest threat to equal treatment under the law changed over time. Finally, the course provides opportunities for students to actively participate in the US Civil Rights tradition.
AMST 30994	Incidents of hate-driven political violence and domestic terrorism have increased in the United States in recent years and are the highest they have been in decades. Non-partisan studies show this upsurge in violence has been driven primarily by white-supremacist, anti-Muslim, and anti-government extremism. What are the causes of this upsurge in extremism and political violence? What is its impact upon contemporary society, religion, and politics? What do the categories and practices of peacebuilding have to offer for purposes of constructive and transformational responses to such violence and its causes? This course explores answers to these questions. It examines how the causes and conditions of the upsurge in extremist politics and political violence relate to racism, nationalism, xenophobia, and the political weaponizing of American religion. We will explore such factors as the role of ethno-nationalism in the wide-spread Evangelical Christian embrace of QAnon conspiracy theories and political organizing, the merging of Catholic and Orthodox Christian &quot;traditionalism&quot; with political authoritarianism (e.g. especially as modeled by contemporary Hungary, Poland, and Russia), the so-called &quot;Alt-Right&quot; organizing and activism (e.g. the &quot;Unite the Right&quot; marches and rallies in Charlottesville), the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capital, the relation of the so-called &quot;Gun Lobby&quot; to increased militance of political rhetoric and organizing, militia organizing and participation in political violence and terrorism, and invocations of a looming &quot;civil war&quot; as the inevitable result of deep and persistent political polarization in the U.S. Readings will include Janelle Wong's Immigrants, Evangelicals, and Politics in an Era of Demographic Change; Kristen Kobes Du Mez's From Jesus to John Wayne; Cynthia Miller-Idriss' Hate in the Homeland; Barbara Walters' How Civil Wars Start; Sarah Riccardi-Swartz's Between Heaven and Russia; and Ryan Busse's Gun Fight, among others.
AMST 30995	This course examines the socio-histories, movement, and settlement patterns of racial minorities in America. The course will focus on how race and racial imaginaries shape the movement and settlement of racial minorities. It will include deep examinations of these mobility patterns and how they are constructed and articulated through laws, policies, and social arrangements. Special attention will be paid to the racialization of the United States, American-ness as whiteness, and the consequences for the social and physical landscape. And finally, the course will consider how the racial construction of America is manifested and buttressed through the built environment and the consequences.
AMST 40420	This course undertakes a broad examination of black politics in multiracial America. Racial issues have provoked crises in American politics; changes in racial status have prompted American political institutions to operate in distinctive ways. The course examines the interface of black politics with and within the American political system. How successful have blacks been as they attempted to penetrate the electoral system in the post civil rights era. What conflicts and controversies have arisen as African Americans have sought to integrate the American system of power. Now that the laws have been changed to permit limited integration, should African Americans integrate politically, that is should they attempt to 'deracialize' their political appeals and strategy, with an effort to &quot;crossover politically;&quot; are some approaches such as those of President Barack Obama &quot;not black enough?&quot; What internal political challenges do African Americans face; some such as the increasing importance of class and socioeconomic factors, as well as gender and sexuality may reshape the definition of the black community. What intellectual challenges and strategic choices are they facing as the American population has grown increasingly multiracial. Finally, in light of these demographic changes in American life and American politics, how stable will past patterns of political participation, and political organizations and institutions of African American politics remain.
AMST 40613	This course covers the varied experience of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (and other gender-fluid) Americans over the course of the twentieth century. As much as possible, it will focus on the voices of LGBT people themselves, in the context of the changing meanings of what it was to claim those identities. To do this we will draw on primary sources--art, music, film, literature, interviews and oral histories, memoirs and autobiographies, plays, films. The focus will be on the ways people understood who they were--and what homosexual/ gay/ lesbian/ queer/ transsexual/ transgender/ et al identities meant to them--and how these identities changed over the course of the twentieth century, using a wide variety of primary sources and relevant disciplinary frameworks.
AMST 43144	How many American Studies seniors does it take to analyze a joke? By studying humor seriously in its historical and sociocultural contexts, this senior seminar will introduce students to critical approaches to humor and power in the United States. Instead of taking humor and laughter for granted as self-evident phenomena, we will consider how practices of humor might intersect with structural hierarchies, including those of race, gender, sexuality, nationality, and religion. Students will engage with a wide variety of sources, including primary documents such as films and political cartoons, theories of humor, and critical scholarship on key American texts of humor. We will also explore vernacular theories about the value of having &quot;a sense of humor&quot; and explore how entire groups of people have historically been excluded from this category. The senior seminar is designed to be a culminating experience for American Studies.
AMST 45903	This is an academic internship that will place the selected applicant as a writer for the NDIGI (Notre Dame Institute for Global Investing).  The student intern will write articles for the NDIGI website, as well as for the other NDIGI communication channels: e-newsletter, various reports and social media.  Some of the topics will include &quot;people profiles,&quot; and coverage of NDIGI events and programs.  This is a collaboration between the NIGI and the Department of American Studies that will provide a unique professional experience to the right candidate.  Must be an American Studies major.
AMST 47910	This course is a 3 credit hour independent writing course for students working on a senior thesis.  It follows the Senior Thesis Capstone course and is taken in the spring semester with the student's primary thesis advisor.  During the semester students complete their research, refine their project's argument and form, and develop a final draft of their thesis. The advisor meets regularly with their thesis students throughout the semester to evaluate each student's progress and review preliminary drafts.  Students are expected to finish their final thesis by the first week of April, and to present their thesis at the American Studies Celebration of Undergraduate Research in late April.  Final theses will be evaluated by the student's primary advisor as well as their secondary advisor.  The student's course grade is based on these two evaluations (which will be given equal weight) as well as their presentation and the progress they demonstrated throughout the semester.
ANTH 10109	This course deals with the nature of anthropology as a broad and diverse area of study. The anthropological study of humankind will be approached from the perspectives of physical anthropology; prehistory and archaeology; and linguistic anthropology and socio-cultural anthropology. The diversity of humankind will be explored in all its aspects from times past to the present. 
ANTH 10118	Creole is spoken by an estimated seventeen million people. Creole is spoken on the islands of the Caribbean and the western Indian Ocean that were former or current French colonial possessions and in the countries where many of these former island residents have emigrated, including the United States, Canada, France, Dominican Republic, Bahamas and other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean. Haitians are the largest Creole speech community of approximately eleven and a half million speakers. Creole language courses provide a valuable foundation for Notre Dame faculty, staff and students working to understand and address critical issues related to Haiti and the Francophone world, from language and culture to history and education, from engineering to public health. Creole language and literature are of increasing interest in the dynamic field of Francophone studies. Creole has also become a major area in the field of linguistics, especially in areas of language evolution, sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. This is a three-credit introductory language course. The instructor will balance both spoken and written Creole as well as exercise reading and listening.
ANTH 10195	Human beings may be classified as one species among many in biological terms, although a strict physical determination marks only the starting point for a broad inquiry into what we mean by human nature. Anthropology moves forward from this beginning to explore, in theory and by empirical investigation, the particular forms of cultural expression that characterize the development of human societies and account for their richness and their remarkable variety. This course examines the fundamental elements of this fascinating social science. It addresses the sometimes-controversial evidence related to such questions as evolution and genetics, as well as issues of ecological adaptation and the emergence of complex societies. It looks into language and other symbolic systems as central components of distinctively human behavior. It concentrates with special emphasis on the vast domain of social and cultural life, drawing upon many ethnographic examples from near and far, to illustrate how anthropologists seek to study all dimensions of human experience, from kinship to kingship and from cyborgs to shamans. Seminar format.
ANTH 10202	This course is an introduction to the methods, goals, and theoretical concepts of archaeology, with a primary focus on anthropological archaeology practiced in the Middle East, North America, and Europe. The field of archaeology is broadly concerned with material culture (at times combined with textual information) that can be employed to generate interpretations about past human societies. The challenge of this social science is to interpret past societies and anthropological behavior using the fragmentary, but nonetheless rich and complex, data base of the archaeological record. Lecture topics will include the methods and goals of archaeological excavation; analytical techniques employed in material studies; and the problems and challenges in the interpretation of past human behavior. Case studies of survey, excavation, and analytical techniques will focus on recent or on-going investigations of archaeological sites in North America, Central America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
ANTH 10203	This class is designed to introduce anthropology as a lens to analyze the human condition and the diversity of human expression. We will also identify key topical themes and interests in cultural anthropology including an overview of its history and methods. Anthropology illuminates the myriad of cultural patterns and social systems throughout the world. Expressed through ethnography, anthropology reveals a vast variety of global cultural phenomena that reveal complex social patterns and the stunning vibrancy of ways we can live and view life. The course explores human action through multiple holistic lenses including culture concepts, kinship patterns, economic strategies, political practices, religious rituals, artistic performances, gender roles, ethnic identities, communicative languages, medical systems, patterns of violence, and the legacies of globalization.
ANTH 10204	Language is fully embedded in human culture and society. It has both meaning and efficacy; that is, it both means things and does things. Our goal in this course is to become aware of some of the ways language functions in social life, often below the level of awareness of its users. Students will engage in a number of practical exercises that demonstrate some of the more astonishing features of language all around us. Topics include: the nature of language, including language origins, nonverbal communication, and electronic communication; language, culture, and thought (linguistic relativity); speech acts and what we do with words; conversational analysis; language and identity (class, race, gender); and language in the world (multilingualism, language endangerment and revitalization, language and education).
ANTH 10311	What are the cultures of medicine? How does belief create possibilities for healing? How do cultural, social, and political forces shape experiences of illness? When can care be a form of violence? How can histories of oppression make you sick? Medical anthropology is an expansive field of research concerned with the study of medicine, affliction, and healing in historical and cultural context. This course provides an introduction to topics in medical anthropology, from classical texts on belief, illness experience, and structural violence to contemporary work on disability, care, and critical global health. Over the course of the semester, students will gain experience in methods, critical thinking, independent research, and public communication as we collectively explore what medical anthropology can contribute to the urgent health challenges that we face in the contemporary world today.
ANTH 10377	In the anthropological study of religion, does having a religious background benefit a researcher or does it introduce bias? Where does theology belong in the anthropology of religion, and what might the two learn from each other? Can one critically study a faith and live it at the same time? This course addresses these questions through a review of the lives and work of prominent anthropologists who identified as Catholic and drew inspiration from their Catholic faith. In examining how these anthropologists shaped the discipline, students will learn about the wide breadth of the anthropological study of religion, an endeavor that stretches from the origins of our species to the high-tech world in which we now live. This disciplinary survey will also lead to questions of how, through these particular anthropologists, insights from the anthropology of religion intersect, complicate, and enrich the Catholic intellectual tradition.
ANTH 13181	Anthropology, the holistic study of humans and their societies and cultures, is the focus of this seminar course. Through discussion and analysis of a variety of anthropology texts, this seminar course aims to develop writing skills among first-year students while exposing them to some central problems and issues within anthropology. Adopting an approach that reflects the four-field character of anthropology, the seminar will encourage students to explore topics such as: (1) anthropology as a way of knowing; (2) anthropology as an encounter with, and effort to explain, human diversity; (3) anthropology as a discipline that uniquely contributes to our understanding of the symbolic dimensions of human behavior and communication; (4) anthropology as a discipline that uniquely contributes to our understanding of human strategies for subsistence and survival; and (5) anthropology as a discipline that uniquely contributes to our understanding of human biological and cultural origins.
ANTH 13200	Humans deeply affect their social and natural worlds. Their impact reverberates across time and space making it difficult to understand the long-term ramifications of our daily decisions and actions. This seminar enhances our understanding of the complex web of relationships between humans, resources, and climate by exploring the concepts of sustainability and collapse from an anthropological perspective. Key questions guiding this exploration include: What do we mean by sustainability? What is it that want to sustain? How can societies be &quot;sustained&quot; when we know societal collapses happen time and again? Through readings, media, debates, and analysis, we will learn how our culture shapes and promotes both sustainability and collapse and assess whether they can be attained or prevent. And, we will all gain a better understanding of our place in the world around us.
ANTH 20002	In this course, you will explore major subfields of linguistics, including sociolinguistics, phonetics (the sounds of language), phonology (the sound systems of language), morphology and lexicon (structured meanings in words), morphemes (units of meaning), syntax, and semantics. You will investigate the scientific study of language (a.k.a. Linguistics), with an emphasis on developing the basic vocabulary and analytical skills associated with the major branches of linguistic research.
ANTH 20011	This interdisciplinary course explores the challenges of environmental sustainability through social, economic, scientific, and ethical lenses. Taught jointly by professors from the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences, the course aims to instill broad, integrative and critical thinking about global environmental problems whose solutions will depend on multidisciplinary approaches. This gateway course to the Minor in Sustainability is open to all students interested in a deep exploration of these critical issues. Students considering the Minor in Sustainability are encouraged to take this course during their sophomore year.
ANTH 20023	This course will discuss the 19th century concept of folklore and its application in Ireland. &quot;Irish folklore&quot; is usually understood in terms of three main and related domains: &quot;folk narrative&quot; (or oral literature), &quot;folk belief&quot; (or popular religion) and &quot;material folk culture.&quot; These will be examined with special emphasis placed on narrative. Representative oral narrative texts from the Gaelic tradition will be studied in translation.
ANTH 20093	Design thinking has emerged as a powerful methodology to catalyze breakthrough innovation for an array of complex business, social and humanitarian challenges. Business and industry have embraced design thinking as one of the most potent drivers of innovation, growth and prosperity for its’ deeply human-centered approach to problem solving. During this fast paced, hybrid, hands-on journey through the design thinking process, students will immerse themselves in a series of overlapping modules that introduce the various phases in the design thinking process and familiarize students with the tools and techniques. This course will unleash your creativity and ingenuity in addressing problems through a human centered framework and mindset, applying this methodology to a vast array of human-centered problems, and complementing disciplines from science and engineering to business and the liberal arts. This course fulfills a Core Curriculum Liberal Arts 4 Way of Knowing (Arts) as well as the gateway to the Collaborative Innovation minor and cross-listed with other minors including: Sustainability, Computing &amp; Digital Technologies, Education, Schooling &amp; Society, Entrepreneurship and Anthropology.
ANTH 20109	This course deals with the nature of anthropology as a broad and diverse area of study. The anthropological study of humankind will be approached from the perspectives of physical anthropology; prehistory and archaeology; and linguistic anthropology and socio-cultural anthropology. The diversity of humankind will be explored in all its aspects from times past to the present.
ANTH 20110	&quot;Hacking&quot; is one of the most pressing topics of technological and societal interest. Yet, it is one of the most misunderstood and mischaracterized practices in the public sphere, given its ethical and technical complexities. In this course we will combine anthropological and computer science methods to explore the digital tools, practices, and sociocultural histories of hacking with a focus on their context of occurrence from the late 1960s to the present. Our goal is to help students think anthropologically about computing as well as technically about the digital mediations that we depend on in our lives.  Computer Science is a great partner for Anthropology: computational methods have been part of the discipline since the 1970s with the use of digital computers for the study of cultural phenomena. Likewise, archaeology is a powerful companion of computing: its approach to material culture is suitable for the study of the sociocultural aspects of tool-making that are fundamental for understanding computing expertise. One of the most important aspects of hacking today consists in creating a community around tools for the exploration of digital technologies. The interplay between social and technical aspects, however, is one of the most neglected in the existing literature on hacking and computer security. Our proposal is, therefore, to bridge a serious gap between social and technical studies of digital technologies with a focus on hacking.
ANTH 20201	This course approaches human evolution from a theoretical point of view that combines both biological and cultural processes into a cohesive bio-cultural model. It begins by tracing the development of modern evolutionary theory and the place of evolutionary studies in anthropology, especially in the sub-field of bioanthropology. These concepts provide the framework for understanding the many lines of evidence that anthropologists use to explore and explain human evolution. These include studies of our primate relatives, through the intricacies of the fossil record, to archaeological evidence for the invention of material culture from the simplest stone tools to the complex cultural world that we live in today. Modern human variation can only be explained as the result of evolutionary forces acting on the complex interplay of biology and culture over millions of years. We continue to be affected by these forces, and this course not only provides information about where we came from, it also provides the scientific backgrounds to help us understand where we might be going as our species continues to evolve.
ANTH 20202	This course is an introduction to the methods, goals, and theoretical concepts of archaeology, with a primary focus on anthropological archaeology practiced in the Middle East, North America, and Europe. The field of archaeology is broadly concerned with material culture (at times combined with textual information) that can be employed to generate interpretations about past human societies. The challenge of this social science is to interpret past societies and anthropological behavior using the fragmentary, but nonetheless rich and complex, data base of the archaeological record. Lecture topics will include the methods and goals of archaeological excavation; analytical techniques employed in material studies; and the problems and challenges in the interpretation of past human behavior. Case studies of survey, excavation, and analytical techniques will focus on recent or on-going investigations of archaeological sites in North America, Central America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
ANTH 20203	This course introduces students to the field of social-cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropologists are primarily interested in exploring issues of human cultural diversity across cultures and through time. This course will explore key theoretical, topical, and ethical issues of interest to cultural anthropologists. We will examine diverse ways in which people around the globe have constructed social organizations (such as kinship, and political and economic systems) and cultural identities (such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, race, and class) and we will consider the impact of increasing globalization on such processes. Throughout the course we will consider how different anthropologists go about their work as they engage in research and as they represent others through the writing of ethnographies.
ANTH 20204	Language is fully embedded in human culture and society. It has both meaning and efficacy; that is, it both means things and does things. Our goal in this course is to become aware of some of the ways language functions in social life, often below the level of awareness of its users. Students will engage in a number of practical exercises that demonstrate some of the more astonishing features of language all around us. Topics include: the nature of language, including language origins, nonverbal communication, and electronic communication; language, culture, and thought (linguistic relativity); speech acts and what we do with words; conversational analysis; language and identity (class, race, gender); and language in the world (multilingualism, language endangerment and revitalization, language and education).
ANTH 20224	Boston Celtics (baseball), Glasgow Celtic (soccer), Celtic spirituality, Celtic music, Celtic art... The word &quot;Celtic&quot; seems to cover a multitude, yet also has a more specific meaning. It refers to a people of the ancient world known to the Greeks and the Romans and who left their trace in many parts of Europe; it refers to rich medieval cultures in Ireland and Britain; and it refers to a group of living languages and literatures such as Irish and Scottish Gaelic, Welsh and Breton. But &quot;Celtic&quot; also evokes certain qualities and characteristics such as passion, sensitivity, imagination, musicality and bellicosity, which have been attributed to the Irish and the Scottish Highlanders, for example, since the Romantic period. This course gives a concise introduction to the question of who were and who are the Celts.
ANTH 20303	What does it mean to be Korean? How are definitions of Korea and “Koreanness” affected by recent waves of globalization and migration? This course investigates the social construction of race and nationhood within the context of South Korea. While many believe South Korea to be ethnically and racially homogeneous, the country has increasingly opened up its borders to foreign migration to offset the adverse impact of its rapidly aging society. More than one in ten marriages in South Korea involves a foreign-born person today, and growing numbers of racially mixed people consider themselves Korean. In addition, members of the Korean diaspora have started to “return” to their country of origin in recent years, only to find that they are marginalized because of their culturally different backgrounds. This course introduces students to sociological theories of race, ethnicity, and nationhood by analyzing how South Koreans define self and Other. We will learn how racial and ethnic identities continue to evolve as the contexts of migration change. We will also learn why it is difficult for individuals of particular backgrounds to find a sense of belonging in the societies in which they live and work.
ANTH 20311	What are the cultures of medicine? How does belief create possibilities for healing? How do cultural, social, and political forces shape experiences of illness? When can care be a form of violence? How can histories of oppression make you sick? Medical anthropology is an expansive field of research concerned with the study of medicine, affliction, and healing in historical and cultural context. This course provides an introduction to topics in medical anthropology, from classical texts on belief, illness experience, and structural violence to contemporary work on disability, care, and critical global health. Over the course of the semester, students will gain experience in methods, critical thinking, independent research, and public communication as we collectively explore what medical anthropology can contribute to the urgent health challenges that we face in the contemporary world today.

This disciplinary survey will also lead to questions of how, through these particular anthropologists, insights from the anthropology of religion intersect, complicate, and enrich the Catholic intellectual tradition.
ANTH 20701	This course will examine the Latino experience in the United States, including the historical, cultural, and political foundations of Latino life. We will approach these topics comparatively, thus attention will be given to the various experiences of a multiplicity of Latino groups in the United States.
ANTH 23200	Humans deeply affect their social and natural worlds. Their impact reverberates across time and space making it difficult to understand the long-term ramifications of our daily decisions and actions. This seminar enhances our understanding of the complex web of relationships between humans, resources, and climate by exploring the concepts of sustainability and collapse from an anthropological perspective. Key questions guiding this exploration include: What do we mean by sustainability? What is it that want to sustain?

Through readings, media, debates, and analysis, we will learn how our culture shapes and promotes both sustainability and collapse and assess whether they can be attained or prevent. And, we will all gain a better understanding of our place in the world around us.
ANTH 30025	Many people predict that the 21st century will be the &quot;Asian Century,&quot; dominated by China, India, and other nation-states on the continent. What does it mean to imagine an Asian future? In this class, we answer this question by rethinking connections between past, present, and future, both within and between different nations in Asia. How can we better understand the global connections between past and present if we take Asia, rather than Europe and North America, as our starting point? By contextualizing contemporary issues in Asia within global social and historical context, students will learn to move beyond common stereotypes about the region. We will use materials from history, anthropology, religion, and literature to explore the impacts of colonialism, nationalism, and globalization on everyday life across the continent. Through this course, students will learn how to analyze the intersections of personal, local, regional, and global contexts in order to better explain how Asia shapes our world. All majors and backgrounds are welcome. No prior knowledge about Asian languages or topics is required.
ANTH 30036	Research for Impact is an engaging and dynamic course that investigates wicked problems through creative research methods that provide insights and opportunities for project stakeholders to produce lasting change. Students are equipped with essential quantitative and qualitative research skills and methodologies, empowering them to explore, analyze, and help confront complex design challenges. Students will craft inventive research toolkits, which they will utilize in real-world scenarios to uncover deep needs and foster opportunities for a more inclusive design and research process.
ANTH 30041	Native Americans have long been trapped in a betwixt and between state, caught by the forces of past and present, tradition and assimilation, romanticization and caricature. Yet through it all, Native voices have continued to speak of the Indian experience with great power and eloquence. This course will introduce Native American literature as a distinctive contribution to American and world literature. We will examine a wide range of expressive culture from the last century, including novels, poetry, graphic stories, children's literature, film, digital media, autobiographies, performances of oral literature, and music. Through the passion, creativity, and humor of Indian authors, we will learn something of the historical experience of Native men and women, and how they have reacted to massacres and mascots, racism and reservations, poverty and political oppression. Above all, we will try to understand how indigenous authors have used literature to engage crucial issues of race and culture in the United States that continue to influence their lives: identity, self-discovery, the centrality of place, cultural survival, and the healing power of language and spirituality. Class discussions will incorporate literary, historical, and ethnographic perspectives of Native expressive culture and the agency of authors as artists and activists vis-à-vis the wider American literary tradition. Authors include Sherman Alexie, Nicholas Black Elk, Louise Erdrich, D'Arcy McNickle, N. Scott Momaday, Linda Hogan, Winona LaDuke, and Leonard Peltier.
ANTH 30071	This course will focus on exercises, research and reading from a diverse range of historical and current influential environmental writings from philosophers, economists, environmentalists, theologians, political scientists, naturalists, and practitioners. Learners will analyze the impact that human actions have on the natural world–particularly through foodways, or the social, cultural, and economic practices of producing and consuming food. This course will also explore how our understanding of race/ethnicity, nature, and the environment influences human choices around food. And it offers alternative courses of action toward viable, ethical, and antiracist solutions to questions about sustainable farming, global economic inequality, and world hunger. Throughout the semester, participants will use the lens of race and ethnicity to study and discuss how these two concepts affect access to agricultural land, foodstuffs/ foodways, environmental justice and nature. A fundamental objective will be to create podcasts focused on student’s engagement with the course themes. 
ANTH 30115	This course offers a critical examination of what it means to be an immigrant or child of immigrants through scholarly works, memoirs, blogs, and popular journalism. Since the liberalization of immigration policy in 1965, immigrants from Latin America and Asia are becoming an increasing and emergent demographic of American society. In major American cities such as Los Angeles and New York, they comprise over 50% of the population. This course focuses on how immigrants and the children of immigrants experience the United States. How are immigrants changing the US racial and ethnic structure? How do their experiences differ given varying legal statuses? How is the second generation becoming American? We will explore these questions through readings that focus on family, religion, education, dating and sexuality. This course will include a community based learning component where students will work with immigrant serving organizations. Students will have the option to teach citizenship classes or to work with immigrant children. Service will be 2-3 hours per week outside of class.
ANTH 30121	Why do weight lifters wear lifting belts? How does athletic training and diet differ between endurance athletes and strength athletes? What are the sex-based differences in athletic performance? What impact do supplements and performance enhancing drugs have on athletic performance? Through the use of peer reviewed research, popular media articles, podcasts, and film we will answer these and many other questions within the field of exercise physiology. The course will be split into two broad units: 1) Powerlifters and 2) Marathoners. Topics covered will include cellular metabolism, muscle physiology, training programs, response to training, basic nutrition, body composition, some methodological exercise testing, supplements and performance enhancing drugs, recovery, fatigue, and activity in extreme environments. Through this use of mixed media, we will also discuss how the media misrepresents and misreports exercise physiology studies, making us all more discerning consumers of information.
ANTH 30123	If you were to perform a Google image search of “human evolution,” you would see endless pictures of men linearly evolving from apes to modern humans. These overwhelmingly one-sided depictions are because much of our human evolutionary story has been written by and about men to the exclusion of women. Consequently, many of the key theories explaining the unique suite of human features seem to assume that evolutionary forces act only upon men, and women are merely passive beneficiaries. Not only is this exclusion of roughly half the population sexist, it is also bad science – bad science that to this day has been repeated and perpetuated to justify the status quo. In this class, we will explore human evolution from a feminist perspective intellectually drawing upon human biology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, primatology, exercise physiology, and reproductive health to demonstrate that women were and still are a driving force in human evolution. Using non-traditional learning methods and assignments, we will cover: 1) foundational feminist human evolutionary theory, 2) the pervasiveness of estrogen, 3) physical/athletic performance and sexual division of labor; 4) the significance and frequency of alloparenting; 5) multiple orgasms and the control of women’s sexuality; 6) cooperation and competition among women; 7) concealment (or not) of human ovulation; 8) evolutionary reasons for the difficulty of human birth; 9) the physical and mental resilience of women; and 10) the crucial role grandmothers and menopause. It is my hope that this class not only provides an alternative perspective to current thinking in human evolution, but also encourages students to bring their experiences and perspectives to bear. Because who asks the questions matters, and a greater diversity of views can only improve and enrich our holistic understanding of human evolution.
ANTH 30302	In 2007, after decades of organizing on the part of indigenous activists, the United Nations issued a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Declaration was the result of years of work by people from particular communities--each with its own history, culture, language, and home--who decided to call themselves, and work together as, Indigenous people. This creative step allowed indigenous peoples to work collectively for justice on a global scale, rather than individually and in confrontation with single states. This class explores the concept, and reality, of Indigeneity in both historical and contemporary perspective: we will consider the many shared struggles and opportunities of indigenous peoples around the globe today and the ways that similar (or distinct) histories have led to similar (or distinct) present realities.
ANTH 30307	This course examines the origins and development of contemporary opinions and policies concerning migrations and migrants. It does so by looking backward to the age when transoceanic mobility became more frequent and increasingly more accessible before moving forward to our own times. It is the central claim of this course that it is impossible to understand what drives policy today without first surveying the changing ideas of migration and the movement of people over time. It will therefore take students through the history of migration in the modern world, as well as studying the migrant journey, connections to home, the process and difficulties of assimilation and community creation, and the problems or opportunities that could arise for migrants from characteristics like race, religion, ethnicity, or language. Also considered will be the complex relationship between colonization and migration. In the process, Migrants and Mobility will also examine how different societies place value judgments upon migrants and analyze how and why migration/migrants have been categorized as “good” or “bad” over time. Students will also encounter and consider the effects of growing urbanization and industrialization, changing demography and global trade patterns, and, more recently, the impact of climate change. Migrants and Mobility will be primarily seminar based, placing a premium on participation and analytical discussion.
ANTH 33101	By helping us step back to see humans as primates, mammals, vertebrates, and beyond, evolutionary theory provides a framework for understanding many aspects of our day-to-day lives that shape the health and well-being, including weight gain-diet, psychosocial stress, immune function, sleep patterns, risky behavior, and child development.  But, increasing evidence from the exciting field of &quot;developmental origins of health and disease&quot; suggests that our biological and behavioral patterns are far from being determined solely by our genes. Our early life contexts, from before birth, and possibly even the experiences of our parents and grandparents in prior generations influence how our brains and biological systems function, including how genes are expressed, and thus impact our health and behavior. This course will bring these dynamic perspectives together to answer questions regarding why we get sick, how our bodies flexibly respond to the world around us, and the inheritances we receive from our ancestors.
ANTH 33201	This course is aimed to provide a basic understanding of how Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and satellite imagery can be used to visualize and analyze environmental data. Students will learn basic techniques for analyzing, manipulating and creating geospatial data in both pixel-based (satellite imagery and digital terrain models) and vector based (point, line and polygon representation of spatial data) formats. Students will also learn how acquire high resolution satellite imagery and other GIS data from online data servers.
ANTH 33315	The course will adopt a broad anthropological perspective to introduce students to the cultural and utilitarian contexts of justice that speak to the everyday experience – urging students to rethink issues of education, health, wage, economy, immigration, peace, environment, and spirituality, including the issue of justice itself. We will read some classic and contemporary works on justice that may have (or have not) garnered attention in a world emerging from a pandemic. By the end of the course, students will learn how to use the framework of ‘just-ness’ in things they do on the campus, at home, offices, marketplaces, and inside other social and civil arenas – and unpack their drivers as budding scholars in the humanistic social sciences.
ANTH 33333	As an emergent field of ethnographic theory and methods, design anthropology involves talking to people, figuring out what they want, and creating ways to improve our shared lives. These practices are focused on developing ideas and forms based on people’s needs while anticipating conscious practice and considerate use. Design anthropologists create potentials for future selves, anticipating projected needs and transcending potential limitations. This seminar introduces the emerging phenomenon and ongoing merger of the anthropology of design. It integrates sources in design anthropology, ethnographic design, cultural marketing, and other applied methodologies. We will engage with theoretical discussions, analytical approaches, practicing exercises, and portfolio development to explore the holistic depths of this nascent field.
ANTH 40029	In this course, we will examine the creation of &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sexuality&quot; as objects of development practices around the world. While development projects often assume that gender and sexuality are stable, coherent categories of identity, scholars have long shown that both take socially and historically specific forms as they emerge through social practices. In this course we will read a range of critical case studies that demonstrate the complicated ways that local and transnational ideas about gender, sexuality, and development intersect in everyday life around the world. This course will help you approach &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sexuality&quot;—two key terms in development discourse and global affairs—with an understanding of how these categories shape not just individuals but institutions, processes, and practices.
ANTH 40066	This five-week course will examine forced migration from the perspective of the beliefs, teachings, and programmatic commitments of faith communities. The first week will be devoted to identifying the causes of and global trends in forced migration, as well as the categories of forced migrants. It will also explore the “law of migration”; that is, the diverse legal systems that migrants must negotiate on their journeys and that religious actors use to assess migration policies. The second week will explore the teachings of diverse faith communities on forced migration, their understanding of this immense and growing phenomenon, and their programmatic and policy responses. The third week will segue to state-centered approaches to the governance and management of migration, with a focus on the concepts of sovereignty and the rule of law. It will also consider ideologies such as nativism and exclusionary nationalism that are in tension with the beliefs, policy positions, and programs of religious actors. The fourth week will be devoted to guest speakers and student presentations on situations of protracted displacement throughout the world. Persons in protracted displacement have lived in exile for at least five years and have no viable course out of their “long lasting and intractable status of limbo.” The fifth week will be devoted to US refugee protection trends and policies.
ANTH 40121	Why do weight lifters wear lifting belts? How does athletic training and diet differ between endurance athletes and strength athletes? What are the sex-based differences in athletic performance? What impact do supplements and performance enhancing drugs have on athletic performance? Through the use of peer reviewed research, popular media articles, podcasts, and film we will answer these and many other questions within the field of exercise physiology. The course will be split into two broad units: 1) Powerlifters and 2) Marathoners. Topics covered will include cellular metabolism, muscle physiology, training programs, response to training, basic nutrition, body composition, some methodological exercise testing, supplements and performance enhancing drugs, recovery, fatigue, and activity in extreme environments. Through this use of mixed media, we will also discuss how the media misrepresents and misreports exercise physiology studies, making us all more discerning consumers of information.
ANTH 40123	If you were to perform a Google image search of “human evolution,” you would see endless pictures of men linearly evolving from apes to modern humans. These overwhelmingly one-sided depictions are because much of our human evolutionary story has been written by and about men to the exclusion of women. Consequently, many of the key theories explaining the unique suite of human features seem to assume that evolutionary forces act only upon men, and women are merely passive beneficiaries. Not only is this exclusion of roughly half the population sexist, it is also bad science – bad science that to this day has been repeated and perpetuated to justify the status quo. In this class, we will explore human evolution from a feminist perspective intellectually drawing upon human biology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, primatology, exercise physiology, and reproductive health to demonstrate that women were and still are a driving force in human evolution. Using non-traditional learning methods and assignments, we will cover: 1) foundational feminist human evolutionary theory, 2) the pervasiveness of estrogen, 3) physical/athletic performance and sexual division of labor; 4) the significance and frequency of alloparenting; 5) multiple orgasms and the control of women’s sexuality; 6) cooperation and competition among women; 7) concealment (or not) of human ovulation; 8) evolutionary reasons for the difficulty of human birth; 9) the physical and mental resilience of women; and 10) the crucial role grandmothers and menopause. It is my hope that this class not only provides an alternative perspective to current thinking in human evolution, but also encourages students to bring their experiences and perspectives to bear. Because who asks the questions matters, and a greater diversity of views can only improve and enrich our holistic understanding of human evolution.
ANTH 40201	Service Design is an interdisciplinary course that explores the theories, methods, and practices involved in designing effective and human centered services. Students will be introduced to key concepts and frameworks used in service design, with a focus on creating seamless and customer-centric experiences at critical touch points. As a capstone course, it combines elements from design thinking, design research, visual communication, and industrial design to develop solutions that meet customer needs and create value for organizations.
ANTH 40300	The concept of the &quot;commons&quot; has returned to the focus of socio-environmental research, politics, and theorizing with recent debates on climate crisis and justice. From the late 1960s debates on environmental degradation and overpopulation to the present concerns with social change, economic degrowth, and global warming, the &quot;commons&quot; has returned as a key symbol for social analysis, political organizing, and collective resource management. Since then, various currents have claimed and reclaimed the concept under the guide of &quot;communality,&quot; &quot;conviviality,&quot; &quot;common-pool resources,&quot; and the &quot;common&quot; as concrete alternatives to public and private modes of governance. In the past two decades, the concept has been central as well for the discussion of the &quot;digital commons&quot; with decentralized, community-based governance of online resources. In this seminar, we will map out key definitions of the &quot;commons&quot; to examine socio-technical and socio-environmental alternatives to existing enclosures across a wide range of examples (including, but not limited to land, tools, forests, lakes, heirloom seeds, potable water, fish stocks, software, hardware, and much more). The seminar will be organized around presentations by students and guest speakers, followed by debate of concepts, case studies, and methodological approaches in socio-environmental and digital commons research. We welcome advanced undergraduates and graduate students working on environmental research technologies, climate change, conservation, and sustainability to join the seminar.
ANTH 40302	This course is meant to provide a relatively comprehensive introduction to Marxist theory in relation to expressive culture, or the aesthetic in social life. We begin with the writings of Marx and then move historically through various major re-readings of Marxist thought in relation to aesthetic theory.
ANTH 40400	Anthropology attempts to make sense of an infinitely complicated world by organizing its observations, inquiries, and explanations. Some of these are grand, while others are modest.  Still, all anthropological work involves some kind of analysis.  All analysis stems from a view of what is basic and of what is related most centrally. This course introduces the most powerful analytic perspectives in the four subdisciplines of anthropology, preparing students to encounter and situate anthropological works of all sorts. The seminar format encourages student involvement not only in reading and writing but also in discussion and analysis of the works under consideration.  Written and spoken assignments will permit students to try their hand at a wide range of anthropological practice. Required of all Anthropology majors.  To provide a theoretical background for later courses, anthropology students and faculty highly recommend taking this course in Junior year.
ANTH 40700	This course will give students the opportunity to develop a research proposal and prepare for anthropological fieldwork, regardless of subfield. The class will meet for three weeks at the beginning of the semester and two weeks following Spring Break. The first section will focus on developing a research proposal, seeking approval from the Institutional Review Board, and submitting the proposal for funding. The second part will concentrate on logistical preparation for the field and examining fieldwork ethics and expectations. Students should begin the course with a concrete idea for a research project that they develop in consultation with their advisor.
ANTH 40707	This course provides an intensive introduction to statistical methods of use for anthropological research. It will examine why and when to use quantitative methods, and how such methods can be incorporated into a holistic anthropological research design. Topics covered include probability theory, and parametric, non-parametric, and Bayesian principles of hypothesis testing, data ordination, and methods of analyzing non-independent data including network analysis. All course work will be undertaken using free statistical packages available through the R programing language. No prior mathematical or programming experience is needed.
ANTH 40763	What is race? How do concepts of race change according to social, political, and historical context? Do Asian understandings of race differ from those in the West? How are concepts like &quot;blackness&quot; and &quot;white privilege&quot; interpreted in Asia? In this class, we will grapple with this set of questions by looking at how competing definitions of race and nationhood emerged in conjunction with the rise of the Japanese empire (1910-1945), and American military occupation in Asia during the Cold War. Students will investigate how this historical context has continued to affect the ways more contemporary flows of migrants from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa are racialized in Asia, by analyzing sociological, anthropological, and historical texts of everyday life. No prior knowledge about Asian languages or topics is required.
ANTH 40825	This course examines the intersection of gender, health policy, and health care organization around the world.  Gender is frequently a central contributing (though sometimes ignored) factor to people's health.  Men and women have different biologies, and it thus stands to reason that their lives—social, economic, political, and biological—would have an effect on their health.  What causes men to have different illnesses than women? What places one gender at greater risk for illness than the other?   How do men and women across the world experience health policies?  Are they affected and constrained by similar factors?  How do their work lives affect their experiences with health?  How is the body medically produced? How do poverty and development play a role in people's well-being?  Through an inquiry-based approach, these and other topics will be addressed in this class.
ANTH 41840	This course is a hands-on opportunity to work with a team on an ongoing project—School Story Lab—about people's experiences of being in school, and to amplify the work via social media. School Story Lab builds on both interviews and crowdsourced stories. The goal of the project is to collect and disseminate personal experiences of people (especially students and teachers) involved in schools at all levels, and internationally. Experience-near accounts of school should always be considered by policy makers and those charged with designing schools, but they are often overlooked in favor of simpler standardized measures. These experiences are affective, bodily, social, economic, medical, and more, not just cognitive. Stories provide it all. The course meets weekly for an hour, and students spend another 1-2 hours weekly working on the project: conducting and analyzing interviews, contributing to the website, and bringing their own experiences.
ANTH 43101	Bioarchaeology is the study of human skeletal remains for reconstructing the biology and cultures of past peoples. We will use the three large ancient Near Eastern collections housed in the Anthropology department to explore theoretical and methodological issues related to: paleopathology (violence, infection, &amp; nutrition indicators in particular), population mobility (migration &amp; pilgrimage), subsistence (chemical analysis of diet &amp; weaning), paleodemography, childhood health and adaptability, mortuary analysis, daily activities (musculo-skeletal indicators), bimolecular genetics, and ethical issues faced when working with human remains. We will explore the archaeological and/or historical records associated with each collection as well, for an holistic understanding of ancient life at these sites. This will be a very hand-on class requiring active participation.
ANTH 43102	By helping us step back to see humans as primates, mammals, vertebrates, and beyond, evolutionary theory provides a framework for understanding many aspects of our day-to-day lives that shape the health and well-being, including weight gain-diet, psychosocial stress, immune function, sleep patterns, risky behavior, and child development.

This course will bring these dynamic perspectives together to answer questions regarding why we get sick, how our bodies flexibly respond to the world around us, and the inheritances we receive from our ancestors.
ANTH 43202	In this course, students will explore the potential for studying and reconstructing a prehistory of people through archaeology. We will consider the historical and theoretical foundations of creating an engendered past, the methodological and practical aspects of &quot;doing&quot; engendered archaeology, and the intersection between political feminism, archaeological knowledge production, and the politics of an engendered archaeology. Topics for consideration include feminist perspectives on science, anthropology, and archaeology; concepts of gender in prehistory and the present; women's and men's relations to craft production, state formation, and space; and the complex relationship between feminism, archaeology, and the politics of women and men in archaeology and the archaeological past. Under the broad theoretical, political and historical umbrella of feminism, archaeologists today are negotiating their own paths toward an engendered past from multiple directions, and this course will explore the diversity of these approaches toward creating a prehistory of people.
ANTH 43255	We usually think of field work and excavation as being the essence of archaeology, but much of what we know about the past is learned in the laboratory, where we study the artifacts brought in from the field.  A rough rule of thumb states that two hours of lab time are needed for every hour spent in the field, so in reality, lab work may be even more important than field work in archaeology.  This course is a laboratory class that will use many different activities to teach you about how archaeologists organize, preserve, and study archaeological artifacts to learn about the past.  This class provides an in-depth introduction to basic laboratory methods for the organization, curation, and analysis of pottery, stone tools, metals, soil samples, and floral and faunal remains.  By the end of the semester, you will engage in a hands-on application of course principles by conducting a research project on materials from Notre Dame's archaeological collections.
ANTH 43257	Prehistoric stone tools represent the oldest form of human technology. Much of human prehistory worldwide and throughout ancient times is decipherable primarily through stone tools. Experimental replication of stone technologies is viewed as an essential method to understanding past technologies. Organized as a series of practical laboratory exercises, in this class we deal with a broad survey of the fundamental concepts of stone tool technology, including mechanical properties of tool stone, stone heat treatment, prehistoric quarrying and mining strategies and elementary concepts of flaking stone. Students gain familiarity with these topics in a laboratory context by participating in flint knapping practice and working intensively with several archaeological collections. In addition to the laboratory exercises, students will present the results of a team project based on hands-on manufacture of tools, or analysis of materials from archaeological collections.
ANTH 43500	This course provides a broad approach to technical skills and strategic information for developing a career with anthropology. It focuses on honing tools for careers that are informed by anthropological and ethnographic issues in a variety of institutions and settings. The course is a vehicle from which students can explore professional techniques that augment their career goals and academic interests.

ANTH 48500	Intensive independent research on a special problem area in archaeology, about which the student will be expected to produce a detailed annotated bibliography and write a scholarly paper. 
ANTH 48900	This course provides the student with the opportunity for independent study and the development of skills in research and writing. The effort is the student's own, from the choosing of a topic to the conclusion presented in the final paper. A thesis director is chosen to guide the student and provide assistance. 
ANTH 60093	MATERIALS FEE. Traditionally, design has been used to connote the process by which the physical artifacts of the objects and communications around us come into being. But over the last decade, design has come more and more to describe not only the development of objects but the process by which one shapes the interactions and experiences of people with the systems, services and organizations around us. A deeply human-centered approach to problem solving, design thinking is centered around identifying and reframing complex problems, and solving them through a more creative, iterative and hands-on approach. This course will follow a series of overlapping modules that will introduce the student to the various steps employed in the design thinking process and becoming familiar with the tools and methodologies used. The course will feature a hybrid seminar format with lectures and case studies followed by hands-on exercises and practical applications of the theories in the form of team projects. At the conclusion of the course, students should be able to articulate the tenants of the design thinking process and apply those methodologies to problems of a variety of disciplines from science and engineering to business and the liberal arts. If there are no seats available, please contact the art department (art@nd.edu) and the instructor to indicate interest and to sign-up for the waitlist. The course is the gateway for the Collaborative Innovation minor. Only students enrolled or having completed the course may sign up for the minor. There are only limited seats for juniors and no seats available for seniors with special approval.

ANTH 63500	This course is geared towards understanding, developing, assessing, and applying the necessary skills and tools to undertake advanced research in anthropology. Core areas covered include research project development, design and implementation, connecting theory to practice, institutional review boards (human and animal subjects), ethics, grant writing and evaluating, field and lab work, qualitative vs/and quantitative approaches, and related topics.  In addition to short written assignments and classroom presentations, students will be required to develop a research proposal and a companion grant proposal over the course of the term in dialogue with the topics covered.

ARCH 10211	This course offers a broad overview of the history of architecture and urbanism from antiquity to the present day. Global in its perspective, the course proceeds chronologically through a series of important historical moments and monuments. Lectures examine works as experiential wholes and within their specific contexts. In this way, the emphasis of the course is not on a history of styles but on buildings as complex cultural artifacts. To link examples across time, place, and culture, the course emphasizes themes like ritual and belief, the patron-client relationship, architecture's relationship to power, materials and construction techniques, the authority of historical models, the architect as artist and professional, and the rise of modern cities.   In addition to developing a broad knowledge of major monuments, theoretical ideas, and figures in architectural history, the class will also develop skills for engaging more critically with the built environment. Through readings, assignments, and discussions, students will learn how to analyze visual forms of evidence and to read, think, and communicate about architecture.   Lectures will be offered twice a week, but students will also meet in smaller groups each week for a discussion section with a teaching assistant, where they may participate actively in conversation about course readings, and engage in workshop activities. This introductory course is designed with both architecture majors and non-majors in mind.

ARCH 43311	Catholicism and The City is an Architecture course intended primarily but not exclusively for undergraduate and graduate architecture students, and for undergraduate students from other disciplines. Viewed through the lenses of Catholic metaphysics and social teaching, the norms of historic classical humanist architectural and urban theory and practice, and related contemporary academic disciplines, the course is an introduction to cities generally, and more specifically a typological and historical introduction to the physical and spatial characteristics of the traditional urbanism of western Christendom, its global expansion, present devolution, and future prospects. The course addresses generally the nature and purpose/s of cities as cooperative human artifacts embodying particular cultural ideals and related forms of economic and political organization; and considers specifically cities as they relate to a Catholic understanding of human flourishing grounded in truths about God, creation, and human nature, including strategies for urbanism in a post-urban world in which human beings can flourish in towns and city neighborhoods that both anticipate and sacramentally participate in the City of God.
ARCH 43511	This lecture class in an introduction to the processes and procedures of preforming a building assessment on a historic property. Often the first step in initiating a preservation project, the assessment of a structure identifies current areas of concerns in the building and offers remediation recommendations on the correct procedures for maintaining both historic fabric and economic feasibility of a proposed project. This class will introduce students to the techniques commonly used to assess a structure, as well as the correct format in which to present these findings to a client.  The class will take a step by step approach to examining assessment techniques for all areas of a structure. Student will be introduced to common construction techniques found throughout the United States, common deterioration issues found in these components, as well as typical remediation techniques used to address these issues. Concepts pertaining to adaptive rehabilitation of buildings to meet modern code requirements as well as sustainability will also be addressed.

ARCH 53311	The goal of this course is to focus on the history, theory, and practice of ecclesiastical architecture. The focus will be on five principles of sacred architecture. Students will be required to engage fundamental questions about sacred architecture, including: what makes architecture sacred? How does church architecture reflect Catholic liturgy? Which aspects are universal and which aspects can be local? What should be the place of sacred architecture in the city and in the world? The course is open to architecture students and students in other disciplines.
ARCH 53381	Why do some buildings look and feel better than others? While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, there are universal characteristics and elements that differentiate good and bad designs. This course explores how and why things go wrong so you can recognize and avoid common mistakes.  In some cases, Classical architecture goes bad because of modern code constraints. In other cases, it is because of the limits of available products. But most often, it is simple mistakes in speaking the language of Classical Architecture that throw the designs off track. This course will explore all of these factors and introduce alternatives for creating buildable designs that are true to Classical principles.
ARCH 53411	This course is seminar on the history of architecture in the United States from the colonial period in the 1600s until World War I. The purpose of this course is to introduce some of the formative ideas, major monuments, and characteristic experiences of different building cultures in the United States and to investigate various problems of interpretation raised by the material under review. Architecture will be defined in the broadest possible terms to include vernacular as well as high architecture examples of buildings, distinctive urban configurations, and landscape design. Architectural History will be defined as the record of the rich diversity of human experiences evident in the different ways Americans have shaped the built environment to pursue social, civil, and religious ends. By the end of the semester, students should have an understanding of the cultural and historical factors that shaped American architecture from 1630 to 1915 and should have the ability to identify and distinguish between the different styles and periods of architecture from this period. They should have the research skills to prepare scholarly and theoretical papers and essays on the subject, and they will have experience with in-class presentations on topics related to their research. Course requirements consist of attendance at seminars, completion of required readings and writing assignments.
ARCH 57821	Continuation of Architecture 57811. Spring.
ARCH 60021	“Life Cycle Assessment” is a lecture- and practicum-based class primarily targeted at graduate students. The class is designed as a once-per-week session where we will spend about half the time on lectures and the other half on hands-on activities to practice LCA. The class is designed to introduce you to Life Cycle Assessment as a method for evaluating environmental, and social impacts of products, policies, systems, and services, with a focus on International Standards Organization (ISO)-compliant LCA. We will primarily be using OpenLCA, with some exposure to alternative tools. This course will particularly focus on LCA practice in the context of policy development, with emphasis on LCA’s role as a decision support tool. We will address the implications of LCA and related methods being increasingly required in policy contexts (e.g., for prioritizing grant recipients and allocating tax subsidies). We will also address the challenges associated with disparities in the maturity of various life cycle methods, most notably social LCA in comparison to environmental LCA and life cycle costing. We will evaluate published LCAs in forms like Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements, and also investigate the use of life cycle thinking and LCA for Environmental Product Declarations. The course will also emphasize the role of LCA in the energy transition, particularly given LCA’s strong role in greenhouse gas accounting, and explore how both technological and climate dynamics pose challenges for LCA practice. This course is primarily a methods course, and we will work through case studies and examples together both in and out of class, with a topical emphasis on energy, buildings, and climate due to LCA’s particular relevance in those areas.
ARCH 60221	Part of a two-semester survey introducing graduate students to the history of architecture, this course covers the 1300s to present. The approach is based on the concepts of architectural type and character, and the material is multicultural in scope. The study of type also extends to urban context and placemaking.
ARCH 60421	Qualitative and quanitative principles of modern building assembly and detailing in concrete, steel and glass.

ARCH 71321	An introductory urban design studio with a conservation emphasis. The focus will be on traditional urban neighborhoods and their preservation in terms of physical fabric as well as with respect to social, economic, political, and cultural resilience and sustainability. The close interaction between architecture, urbanism, and historic preservation will be explored through student design proposals.
ARCH 71421	Bi-weekly demonstration session for ARCH 73421: Historic Construction and Preservation.
ARCH 73321	Consideration of the theoretical and practical background of traditional architecture through a careful reading both of primary theoretical sources (including Vitruvius, Alberti, Serlio, Palladio, Vignola, Claude Perrault, and others) as well as influential pattern books; and the pertinence of both to contemporary architectural discourse and practice.
ARCH 73421	This course explores the knowledge that leads to successful preservation of historic construction. The study of materials, methods and resources available to architects from antiquity, through the early twentieth century is requisite for all rational choices made for preservation structures today. Historic Preservation and Construction will provide preservation professionals with information needed to analyze, modify, and certify historic buildings for modern use.   Demonstrations of production or fabrication methods for stone, brick, mortar, paints and wood framing and trim will give first-hand knowledge to preservation specialists. Acceptable practices for structural rehabilitation will be discussed and evaluated.   Students completing this course will have the basis for understanding the process used to build historic structures and the means to preserve them. Course requirements consist of attendance of seminars, completion of required readings and assignments. There will be a midterm and final exam.
ARCH 73422	This seminar class in an introduction to the study of the architectural history of the Americas, with a focus on North American architecture. While we will be studying the progression of styles throughout history, this course will primarily focus on how &quot;fragment societies&quot; (Winks, 1976) have adopted the traditions of their homelands to the geographical and material variations of their new environs, and how these adaptations have developed into widely held concepts of &quot;national&quot; styles.  It is with this concept in mind, that this course will deviate from a traditional &quot;march through history&quot; framework typically adopted by architectural history courses, and instead will focus on regional developments of design and construction which not only reflects the ethnic groups which settled the areas, but the larger societal forces which have influenced their development. During the course of the semester, students will be required to demonstrate their understanding of the course material through written and visual assignments and presentations as well as in-class examinations. It is anticipated that by the end of this course, students will gain a greater understanding of the complexities which comprise the study of architectural history of the Americas, and how to apply their complexities in developing sustainable approaches to both the conservation of existing structures and the design of new compatible buildings.
ARCH 80212	In this course, students will focus on the preparatory process necessary for any architectural or urban design project, developing research, analytical, and programming skills.  Students will each consider a different building type and location.  Exposure to this variety will expand each student's understanding of the range of questions and avenues of inquiry required in design at both the building and urban scales.

ARHI 20103	This course explores how the disciplines of chemistry and the history of art are connected. Experience in either of these discipline is not required to register. Students will engage in interactive solo and group activities in the classroom, the Raclin Murphy Museum of Art, and the chemistry laboratories in Jordan Hall of Science. 
ARHI 20310	This course provides an introduction to key works and themes in Western art from the Renaissance to the twentieth century.  Focusing on a selection of key monuments, artists, and examples of art historical scholarship, and by looking back to classical values and models as well as forward to contemporary debates, we will explore various ways in which Western art has been made, used, and interpreted.  The course will concentrate on building fundamental analytic skills necessary to the study of art, and will consider works of art both from an aesthetic perspective and in the context of the individual, cultural, social, and economic conditions of their production and reception.  Topics will include an investigation of the history of the discipline, the use of objects, and a consideration of how the various practices and processes known as &quot;art&quot; have engaged society and the world. By looking at - and talking about - specific aesthetic phenomena, the course will survey the general history of modern representation and its alternatives.
ARHI 20420	This course surveys the major works of art and architecture produced within the context of the social, political, and intellectual ferment that shaped Europe in the 19th century. We will investigate how artists and architects experimented with new styles, techniques, technologies, and materials in the face of political revolution; cross-cultural exchange and colonialism; developments in philosophy, science, and technology; and the rise of industrial capitalism, the middle class, and the modern city. We will also consider how such works of art participated in the construction of ideas about gender, race, and class; “realism” and objectivity; nature and the environment; and modernity and modernism. Artistic movements covered include Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and Symbolism. While the course focuses on European art, we will touch on relevant developments in American art and global networks of cultural exchange. This course includes visits to the Raclin Murphy Museum of Art.
ARHI 20451	In 1419, a Florentine goldsmith designed a building that changed the history of Western architecture. It was the first structure since antiquity to systematically apply the formal vocabulary of ancient Greco-Roman architecture. This new experiment with old ideas took Florence and then Europe by storm. In this course, we will investigate the revival—and transformation—of the classical architectural language, the emerging ideas about architectural authorship, the ability of architectural forms and materials to convey particular meanings to particular audiences, and the deployment of architecture as an instrument of power.
ARHI 30204	This class explores the development of monumental mosaic and fresco in the Middle Ages through key monuments in places like Rome, Constantinople, Thessaloniki, Palermo, and Venice. A central goal for the course will be to understand the ways in which mural paintings and mosaics distinguish themselves from other visual media in the medieval world. We will consider the relationship between murals and their architectural setting and how the relative size of wall paintings and mosaics impacts the way beholders relate to and understand them. We will also examine the many different functions of medieval murals, as media for story-telling, as liturgical instruments, and as vehicles for the transmission of knowledge, theological doctrines, or political propaganda.
ARHI 30805	This course traces the developments of contemporary art practice in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, and subsequently expands beyond this physical location to include global borders and artworks that reflect on living in between cultures, races, and languages. Students will develop a toolkit for analyzing the way borders shape culture and identity (race, gender, sexuality, class, religion, and ethnicity) in transnational points of contact. With an emphasis on printmaking, performance, photography, and film, the course will dwell on borders that respond to paradigms of fear and desire, contagion and containment, utopia and dystopia. Students will enhance their skills in visual analysis and writing, and refine their ability to conduct original research. No pre-requisites or prior knowledge of Art History and Latinx Studies is required for the course.
ARHI 30820	This survey traces the developments of photographic practices in Latin America and its US-based diasporas. We will look at the origins of photography in the region (from early explorers to portraitists and artists) and how the medium helped shape ideas on nationalism, modernity, cosmopolitanism, internationalism, and migration. Students will develop a toolkit for analyzing photographs from various social lenses attentive to the workings of race, class, and gender from the nineteenth century to the present. Much of the class will be based on the Raclin Murphy Museum photography collection providing opportunities to work with historical and contemporary photographs in person. Students will enhance their skills in visual analysis and writing, and refine their ability to conduct original research. No prerequisites or prior knowledge of Art History is required for the course.
ARHI 33151	Museums are not only caretakers of cultural artifacts; they are also microcosms that reflect a society’s beliefs about the order of the world and, in turn, teach us about our place within it. This seminar considers the museum from its origins in individual collections and cabinets of curiosity to the rise of the modern public museum and its role in the present day. We will investigate how these institutions—including art, ethnography, natural history, and local history museums—have preserved, constructed, and erased cultural memory, identity, and knowledge. We will pay particular attention to recent efforts to reckon with the imperialist legacy of museums, including repatriation, artists’ interventions, and the inclusion of narratives, objects, and voices traditionally excluded from museum spaces. This course includes visits to campus and area museums and discussions with museum professionals.
ARHI 40231	This class explores medieval representations of scientific ideas and mythological stories.
ARHI 43406	This seminar concentrates on art made within the last forty years and looks at the everyday as it relates theoretically, materially, and historically to such practices.  By examining artwork that takes the everyday as its source, subject, or material point of departure, we will consider how that realm is useful for its position as a place outside of the sphere of professional artistic practices. Looking at the use of amateur and domestic materials and objects in art, as well as works that mimic daily routines (eating, housekeeping, childrearing, playing, etc.) will play a large role in our investigations. Additionally, we will examine theories of the everyday and those problems that accompany attempts to concretize abstract ideas such as routines and habits.  In so doing, we will aim to question those biases that conventionally accompany everyday experience that often deem it to be altogether mundane and apolitical, and look at how artists counter such notions by mining its common experiences for its politicized potential. Some of the artists we will look at include Louise Bourgeois, Robert Gober, Anna Maria Maolino, Amalia Mesa-Baines, Ree Morton, Martha Rosler, Do Ho Suh, and Rikrit Tiravanija.

ARST 30103	This course provides an atmosphere for detailed conversation and exploration of students' individual work within the contemporary context of sculpture. Quite often artists work for several years with different series, while not having a clear compartmentalization of the works in their mind, or what is the work about. This course will help students to push their conceptual work to a more advanced level with the creation of a proposal for an exhibition, the development of a website, referencing their own interest and studio practice, while in consultation with the instructor. The class will provide an in-depth exploration of how to categorize and describe their various bodies of work into different series according to subject matter, formal aspect, and materials. Sculpture seminars may include topics such as discussions of contemporary issues, exhibitions, professional practice, or methods and directions. The class meets regularly for lectures, visiting artists, and/or field trips.

A combination of production, critique, and readings will advance student understandings of narrative structure and experimental approaches to time-based media.
ARST 30421	This course will approach the digital medium of video art to consider spatial possibilities of installation. We will explore how to create an experiential presence for video art, both virtually and physically. Looking at contemporary examples of video artwork that have global significance, we will develop the language to critically analyze their effect. There are largely two components—understanding video art and its social impact, and the technical skills of projection mapping, After Effects, 360 camera, working with the realities of gallery installation. The course will end with a collective project installation. Over the semester we will acquire awareness as makers who have a close relationship to our surrounding society.
ARST 40203	MATERIALS FEE. The emphasis is on drawing in all its aspects: materials, methods, techniques, composition, design, and personal expression. The human figure is the subject matter.

ASIA 17001	Special studies course for students interested in learning Hindi.
ASIA 20033	The Thousand and One Nights, also known as the Arabian Nights, is a collection of tales originated in the Arab lands that has become a masterpiece of world literature. These enchanting stories, framed by the tale of Scheherazade (or Shahrazad), have enjoyed a widespread and varied reputation over the centuries and across cultures. It is said that the Thousand and One Nights is the most read (or heard about) book in human history, second only to Bible. In this class, we will examine these stories from a variety of academic and cultural perspectives, taking advantage of the wealth of material available (both textual and audio-visual). We will examine issues of provenance: where did these stories originate and when? We will study the stories as literary texts as well as historical documents, asking what, if anything, they tell us about the cultures they reflect and the societies in which they are set. We will examine how these tales have been interpreted by later societies, both Arab and Western, and what those interpretations tell us about the interpreters. We will use this class and its content to introduce ourselves to the study of the Middle East, its languages, history, literature, and peoples. We will gain a better understanding of the analytical tools and techniques for the study and appreciation of literature in general.
ASIA 20055	This course examines the history of the Middle East from the late eighteenth century to the Arab uprisings of 2011. We will approach cultural, social, political and intellectual transformations in the Middle East. We will pursue a number of themes including engagements with modernity; reactions to Western colonial expansion; religious and secular reform movements; nationalism and revolution; changes in gender and family experiences; the Arab-Israeli conflict; the impact of oil and the Cold War; postcolonial state-building; the rise of political Islam and piety movements; globalization and economic disparities; and movements for democracy and social justice.
ASIA 20101	This course aims at introducing students to the history of the Arab world. Through a panoramic view encompassing twelve centuries of Arab history and culture, we look at all sides of this rich and venerable civilization: the beauty of the Alhambra and the great mosques, the importance attached to education, the achievements of Arab science—but also internal conflicts, widespread poverty, the role of women, and the contemporary Palestinian question. We explore how the religion of Islam created a far-flung Arab Muslim world that embraced lands reaching from the shores of the Atlantic to Iraq and the Indian Ocean. Each has its own geographical features and historical traditions, yet certain themes and experiences are common to all: the rise and spread of Islam, the growth of the Ottoman Empire, the expansion of European trade and empire, and in the last decades, the challenge of Islamic resurgence and integration into a new kind of world. We attempt at a clear and comprehensive interpretation of the paths of the Muslim religion, its divisions, its authorities and traditions, its current contradictory powers to unite and to divide. Throughout, social institutions and culture are intertwined with politics and economics. The texts we read in this class are studded with famous names from the past—Ibn Khaldun, al-Ghazali, and Ibn Sina (Avicenna); Saladin and ‘Abd al-Nasir (Nasser)—as well as with those of the recent memory—Hafiz al-Asad and Saddam Husayn; the Nobel Prize winner Najib Mahfuz, the cultural critic Edward Said and popular singer Umm Kulthum.
ASIA 20200	When India gained independence from British Rule in 1947, democracy was not expected to last in the heterogeneous and poor sub-continent. Yet, democracy has thrived in India for over 70 years. More recently, other South Asian countries have democratized. What explains this unexpected trend? Is there a connection between colonial legacies, international institutions and South Asian democratization successes (and failures)? After an overview of caste, religion and language in the region, this course explores South Asian politics by examining the historical and institutional development of democracy in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, including internal and external threats to democratic institutions. In particular, we will examine how the politics of accommodation and good institutional design have affected the persistence of democracy on the sub-continent, while also considering how non-state actors and international organizations have impacted outcomes. The course also takes a deep look at the degree to which findings from South Asia might be used in other parts of the world and relevant policy implications. 
ASIA 20203	This course introduces students to the field of social-cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropologists are primarily interested in exploring issues of human cultural diversity across cultures and through time. This course will explore key theoretical, topical, and ethical issues of interest to cultural anthropologists. We will examine diverse ways in which people around the globe have constructed social organizations (such as kinship, and political and economic systems) and cultural identities (such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, race, and class) and we will consider the impact of increasing globalization on such processes. Throughout the course we will consider how different anthropologists go about their work as they engage in research and as they represent others through the writing of ethnographies. 
ASIA 20300	What does it mean to be Korean? How are definitions of Korea and “Koreanness” affected by recent waves of globalization and migration? This course investigates the social construction of race and nationhood within the context of South Korea. While many believe South Korea to be ethnically and racially homogeneous, the country has increasingly opened up its borders to foreign migration to offset the adverse impact of its rapidly aging society. More than one in ten marriages in South Korea involves a foreign-born person today, and growing numbers of racially mixed people consider themselves Korean. In addition, members of the Korean diaspora have started to “return” to their country of origin in recent years, only to find that they are marginalized because of their culturally different backgrounds. This course introduces students to sociological theories of race, ethnicity, and nationhood by analyzing how South Koreans define self and Other. We will learn how racial and ethnic identities continue to evolve as the contexts of migration change. We will also learn why it is difficult for individuals of particular backgrounds to find a sense of belonging in the societies in which they live and work.
ASIA 20600	Understanding religious communities and their values are crucial to understanding human societies and global affairs. One particular group of interpreters of Islam, namely the traditional or orthodox religious scholars called the ulama and their institutions, are often hidden from contemporary accounts of Islam when in fact they are critical players. This course will provide historical contexts in order to explore how traditional Muslims navigate the discourses of modernity and how they resist it. We will read original texts in translation and secondary sources of descriptions of representatives of the orthodox tradition in regions of Asia, the Middle East and in the West. The course will pay particular attention to the institutions of learning known as madrasas, jami` and hawzas. Of course, the orthodox views are challenged by other Muslims and some of those debates will also be channeled in the class while the focus will remain on the Ulama. The course aims to equip students with analytical skills and the resources to understand how religious ideas impact religious communities and global affairs.
ASIA 20708	This class introduces students to the aims and methods of meditation with a particular emphasis on its Buddhist and Christian forms. It covers the stages of meditation in both traditions, their Scriptural foundations, and the wide variety of techniques used to attain contemplative states, including prayer, visualization, and the control of posture, breath, sleep, and dreams. Christian sources will include the Bible, St. Gregory of Nyssa, Evagrius Ponticus, St. John of Sinai, St. Dominic, St. Bonaventure, Gregory Palamas, St. Ignatius Loyola, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Seraphim of Sarov, and Pavel Florensky. Buddhist sources will include Tsongkhapa, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Lati Rinpoche, and other modern Tibetan authors. Special attention will also be given to recent debates about the Christian practice of yoga.
ASIA 30002	Many people predict that the 21st century will be the &quot;Asian Century,&quot; dominated by China, India, and other nation-states on the continent. What does it mean to imagine an Asian future? In this class, we answer this question by rethinking connections between past, present, and future, both within and between different nations in Asia. How can we better understand the global connections between past and present if we take Asia, rather than Europe and North America, as our starting point? By contextualizing contemporary issues in Asia within global social and historical context, students will learn to move beyond common stereotypes about the region. We will use materials from history, anthropology, religion, and literature to explore the impacts of colonialism, nationalism, and globalization on everyday life across the continent. Through this course, students will learn how to analyze the intersections of personal, local, regional, and global contexts in order to better explain how Asia shapes our world. All majors and backgrounds are welcome. No prior knowledge about Asian languages or topics is required. 
ASIA 30023	This interdisciplinary course offers a topical survey of the relationships between biological sex, culturally bound notions of &quot;masculinity&quot; and &quot;femininity,&quot; and the gendered body in the Islamic tradition. The primary aim of the course is to explore the intersection of religion and social constructions of gender and the body in a variety of historical and cultural contexts in the Muslim World. Students read and interpret religious texts and commentaries, literary and legal texts, women's writings, and media in English translation. Coursework focuses on increasing students' understanding of the diversity of scholarly views on women's bodies as sites of piety and sites of political and social contestation (reproductive rights, public vs. private space, etc.).
ASIA 30056	This course will provide advanced undergraduates and graduate students with a critical introduction to digital humanities for the study of early China, the fountainhead of Chinese Civilization. Collaborating with the Center of Digital Scholarship, this course will focus on relational data with structured information on historical figures, especially high officials, of early Chinese empires. Throughout the semester, we will read academic articles, mine data from primary sources, and employ Gephi and ArcGIS to visualize data. Those constructed data will cover three major themes: how geographical mobility contributed to consolidating a newly unified empire over diversified regions; how social networks served as the hidden social structure channeling the flow of power and talents; and how criminal records and excavated legal statutes shed light on the unique understanding of law and its relationship with the state in Chinese history.
ASIA 30094	India, Pakistan and Bangladesh account for more than a fifth of humanity: nearly two billion people in one of the most densely populated parts of the planet. South Asians speak more than a hundred languages, and represent most of the Hindus, Muslims, Sikh, Jains, and Zoroastrians in the world. The region;s major economy, India, is by itself among the ten largest economies and one of the fastest growing. Yet, there is much about South Asia that can be perplexing. Caste based violence remains widespread in a society that is fast modernizing; billionaires mushroom alongside widespread malnourishment; space missions are launched to Mars amidst vast numbers of illiterate and uneducated citizens; Bollywood thrives while freedom of expression is often under threat; religious fundamentalism exists alongside extraordinary religious pluralism; gay rights expand alongside the murders of atheist bloggers; a democratic government lives in fear of military overthrow; a society that has that has chosen women as heads of state also sees increasing reports of sexual crimes. This course will unravel these knots and explain the processes that gave rise to them. Beginning in the middle of the twentieth century, this course will progress chronologically and bring us to the present day via themes on politics, economy, society, and popular culture. It offers an understanding of contemporary India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh and their place on the global stage.
ASIA 30101	This lecture and discussion course on the religion, philosophy, and intellectual history of China that introduces the student to the world view and life experience of Chinese as they have been drawn from local traditions, as well as worship and sacrifice to heroes, and the cult of the dead. Through a close reading of primary texts in translation, it also surveys China's grand philosophical legacy of Daoism, Buddhism, &quot;Confucianism&quot; and &quot;Neo-Confucianism,&quot; and the later religious accommodation of Christianity and Islam. 
ASIA 30117	This class will survey the various historical and contemporary dimensions of Asian American experiences including immigration &amp; integration, family &amp; community dynamics, ethnic/gender/class identity, as well as transnational and diasporic experiences. We will explore contemporary and historical issues of racism, the model minority myth, inter-generational relationships, and the educational experiences of Asian Americans. To accomplish this, our class will pose such questions as: Who is Asian American? How did racism create Chinatown? Is there an Asian advantage? Coursework includes essays based on topics of your choice, presentations, and a creative narrative.
ASIA 30133	This course traces the history of Buddhism in the United States since the nineteenth century. After considering the history of Asian immigrants who brought Buddhism with them and American-born converts who embraced it here, we take some steps toward a cultural history of Buddhism in the US since 1945, analyzing the tradition's influence on other faiths and on politics, activism, fiction, poetry, painting, video art, film, music, architecture, martial arts, how-to literature, psychology, and medicine.
ASIA 30281	China has gone from international isolation to global superpower in record-breaking time. How has Beijing orchestrated its meteoric rise? How have US policies facilitated and hindered China's efforts to close the power gap? Does China's rise present a challenge to American hegemony and an attack on the U.S. constructed post-WWII order? Are the world's two most powerful states locked in a 'Thucydides Trap' destined for war? This course analyzes China's ascendance through international relations theories and practices.
ASIA 30315	What did it mean to be a man or a woman in Japan in the centuries before the modern era? How did conceptions of masculinity and femininity evolve under the influence of Buddhism and Confucianism, not to mention changes in the social order? Above all, how was gender performed when it came to matters of the heart? In this course, students will explore these issues, primarily through fiction and drama, but also through diaries, essays, and poetry.  The course is divided into three units. Unit 1 surveys the literature of the Imperial court from the 8th through the 12th centuries. We will begin with selections of love poetry from the Man'yoshu, Tales of Ise, and Kokinshu as background for Murasaki Shikibu's epic of courtly love, The Tale of Genji (ca. 1000 A.D.). Unit 2 focuses on plays from the Noh theater, which typically dramatize the problem of desire from a Buddhist perspective. In Unit 3, we will explore the issues of gender and sexuality in Ihara Saikaku's Five Women Who Loved Love (1685) and plays by Chikamatsu Monzaemon, such as The Love-Suicides at Amijima (1721). All materials are in English and no special knowledge of Japan or Japanese is required. Students will also read essays by Western scholars to acquire a critical perspective on the issues of gender and sexuality in specific texts.
ASIA 30340	This course provides an introduction to Korean culture and history through contemporary Korean films. Exploring Korean culture and history through films is recognized as an effective method which helps students understand the past events and interpret embedded messages from the periods as well as explore cinematic representations of past events. This course will guide students to an extensive understanding of modern and contemporary Korean history and thematic issues, including colonization by Japan and Korean nationalism until 1945, the division of the Korean peninsula and Korean War in the 1950s, rapid industrialization in the 1960s to 1980s, democracy and human rights in the 1980s to 1990s, social issues in the 2000s such as Korean diaspora, multiculturalism, inter-Korean confrontation and reconciliation, feminism, familism, cultural hybridity, Korean capitalism and social class. No prior acquaintance with the Korean language and history is required.
ASIA 30342	This course explores the major developments in Byzantium and the Eastern Mediterranean from the time of the crusades and the eastward expansion of the Italian naval powers until the rise of the Ottoman Empire to a new universal power unifying the Balkan Peninsula and Asia Minor under the rule of a Muslim sultanate. The encounter between Latin and Greek Orthodox Christians in the wake of the crusade led to political rivalries and religious discord, culminating in the Latin conquest of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade of 1204. While the eastward expansion of Italian naval powers had already begun in the late eleventh century, it was mainly as a result of 1204 that Venice and, later on, Genoa became predominant political and economic factors in the Eastern Mediterranean, controlling much of the long-distance seaborne trade between Italy and the Syrian coast. The Anatolian Seljuk Turks initiated the gradual Turkification and Islamization of Asia Minor. In the thirteenth century, the Eastern Mediterranean endured increasing pressure from the Mongols and the Mamluk sultanate. One of the results of this development was the rise of the Ottoman principality to a leading political power incorporating large parts of the Balkan Peninsula and, in 1453, the city of Constantinople. We will discuss both socio-economic and political aspects of these developments.
ASIA 30600	In a religiously diverse and vastly troubled world, how do religious traditions motivate believers to work toward the common good? &quot;Engaging World Religions,&quot; the course title, refers to three things we will examine. First, it describes how religions are intrinsically engaging: they draw in adherents by fulfilling their material, intellectual, and spiritual needs. Second, it specifies what various secular institutions like governments and development organizations must do in pursuing the common good across our planet -- most of whose inhabitants are religious. Finally, it characterizes our work in this class: exploring how various religious traditions conceptualize and work toward the common good in a global context. We will read historians, social scientists, philosophers, and critical theorists on how to analyze and interpret the role of religion in contemporary life, while examining case studies of how religious practices, beliefs, and identities intersect with issues in global affairs such as inequality, armed conflict, and climate change. In doing so, we will engage how religious traditions from the East and West -- from Asian and Abrahamic &quot;world&quot; religions, to a variety of indigenous &quot;local&quot; religions -- complicate or complement modern Catholicism's emphasis on Integral Human Development.
ASIA 30750	In 1600, China was the richest country in the world. In 1978, China’s economy accounted for just a trivial amount of world GDP. It was agricultural, backwards, and dirt-poor. Today, its economy is second only to the U.S. The major theme for the course is to develop an understanding of these transitions and prospects for the future. Since the 1950s, society and economy have operated under a central plan. Economic and social policies have allowed Chinese people to build the world’s second largest economy. The speed and the extent of this transition for a country of this size is an economic miracle and unprecedented in history. The economic impact on human welfare has been remarkable, raising millions out of extreme poverty. China’s economic system operates under the heavy hand of an authoritarian government, run by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Economic policy decisions often reflect political reasons. Implementation and focus vary by the CCP leadership. The heavy hand of the state in economic affairs sharply contrasts with the American system. Questions we will seek to answer include: (1) Why was China so poor in 1978? (2) How and why did the economy take off? (3) How does the China economic miracle fit within accepted economic theory? (4) Is China’s economic development and growth sustainable?
ASIA 33320	This course is an introduction to the major authors and works of Japan's modern period, from the 18th century through the middle of the 20th century. We will examine writers, works and literary institutions in historical context to explore how Japanese writers engaged with the changing world in the modern era. This was the period when modern literature, more specifically the novel, was emerging internationally as a new technology of state-building. Early modern Japan was highly literate with a flourishing popular culture that included diverse literary forms (high and low) that would be refashioned, contested and sometimes abandoned as the institution of literature would come to be established by the turn of the 20th century, although not without ongoing contestation. The rise of the novel (shosetsu) as exemplar of literature corresponded with Japan's rise to imperialist power over the fifty-year build-up of the empire. Our themes will include: elite and popular literature; the West, Orientalism and Counter-Orientalism; protest literature by women, workers and ethnic minorities; empire and resistance; modernism and modernity. Authors will include: Higuchi Ichiyo, Natsume Soseki, Tamura Toshiko, Tanizaki Jun'ichiro, Kobayashi Takiji, Edogawa Rampo, and others.
ASIA 33333	As an emergent field of ethnographic theory and methods, design anthropology involves talking to people, figuring out what they want, and creating ways to improve our shared lives. These practices are focused on developing ideas and forms based on people’s needs while anticipating conscious practice and considerate use. Design anthropologists create potentials for future selves, anticipating projected needs and transcending potential limitations. This seminar introduces the emerging phenomenon and ongoing merger of the anthropology of design. It integrates sources in design anthropology, ethnographic design, cultural marketing, and other applied methodologies. We will engage with theoretical discussions, analytical approaches, practicing exercises, and portfolio development to explore the holistic depths of this nascent field.
ASIA 33848	This course encourages students to read and discuss English translations of key modern Chinese literary texts, selected from among those that have delighted western audiences (such as the Nobel Prize winners Gao Xingjian and Mo Yan) as well as those that have been considered of huge significance by Chinese communities at different times. Most of the readings will be short stories and (parts of) novels, but due attention will be paid also to poetry and the prose essay, both incredibly important genres in the Chinese context. Students will be provided with a key vocabulary to discuss the texts, including both western and Chinese critical terminology, and with a range of interpretative methods. They will also be expected to carry out background reading, including academic studies of the literary works under scrutiny, and general works introducing the relevant historical contexts. At the end of the semester, students will have gained a good knowledge of the modern Chinese literary canon and will have gained critical ability in analyzing modern Chinese literary works from a range of perspectives.
ASIA 36000	Requires &quot;contractual agreement&quot; with the professor prior to scheduling. For advanced students who wish to pursue an independent research project reading advanced materials 
ASIA 40130	Asian theatre- and film-makers have produced some of the most innovative and exciting versions of Shakespeare's work. His strong presence in Asia also speaks to the histories and legacies of colonization and cultural imperialism. This course explores several well-known Shakespearean plays through the lens of Asian adaptation, rooted in both close reading of the plays themselves and the historical-cultural contexts of their adaptations. How, when, and why have specific Shakespearean plays captured the imaginations of Asian theatre artists and filmmakers? How have they transformed Shakepearean texts through translation, the use of local performance forms, new geographic and historical settings, and other techniques? How do these reimaginings rethink what &quot;Shakespeare&quot; might mean? By exploring such questions, students will gain a deeper understanding of Shakespeare, Asian theatre, and the complexities of their conjoining.
ASIA 40212	What are Beijing's objectives towards the developing world and how have they have evolved and been pursued over time? In light of China's unprecedented Belt and Road Initiative and increasingly assertive military activities far from its shores, the answer to this question is perhaps more important than ever before. This course analyzes and explains China's strategies in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Latin America, and evaluates their effectiveness. It is informed by the functionally organized academic literature, but uses a regional approach that allows for comparisons among regions based on their economic, political, military, and social characteristics. Topics will cut across the overlapping political, economic and security spheres, with particular attention paid to how different developing countries have perceived and responded to China's rapidly growing engagement and influence. This structure allows us to consider not only the unique features of Chinese engagement in each region, but also place them in the larger context of Beijing's strategy towards other developing regions and the developing world as a whole. This course will be of great interest to students and scholars interested in international development, Chinese foreign policy, comparative political economy, and international relations.
ASIA 40403	At a moment when global challenges - from climate change to inclusive development to public health threats - loom large, many nation-states seem unable to come together to address them. In what ways are the world's cities and subnational governments working on their own and in concert to meet these challenges? This course examines the distinctive roles and capacities of cities, provinces, and states in managing global policy issues and explores different modes of trans-local cooperation and coordination. We start by considering the global governance shortcomings of nation-states and exploring the multilevel character of key policy challenges. We next use case studies from different issue-areas to assess how action by subnational governments is contributing to but also complicating solutions. We conclude by discussing the limitations of subnational approaches to global challenges and considering the most appropriate policy roles and portfolios for subnational actors in the 21st century.
ASIA 40413	This course is an introduction to the Chinese sound and writing system, morphology, and syntax of the modern standard forms from a historical and linguistic perspective. The purpose of this course is to lead students who have the limited or no knowledge of Chinese to explore some interesting language phenomena by comparing Chinese and English, and to familiarize students with fundamental and systematical knowledge of the modern Chinese word formation and sentence structures.
ASIA 40726	In 1965, the Second Vatican Council issued a &quot;Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions&quot;, which contains a statement that Muslims &quot;submit wholeheartedly to even His inscrutable decrees, just as Abraham, with whom the faith of Islam takes pleasure in linking itself, submitted to God.&quot; While the Declaration can be understood as recognizing the possible validity of Islam's claim to Abrahamic status, some scholars have introduced the notion of &quot;Abrahamic religions&quot; as a way of associating Judaism, Christianity and Islam as related faiths. This course will explore the defining features of the Abrahamic religions that tie them closely together as well as their particularities and differences. As the youngest of the three Abrahamic religions, Islam has a lot of things to say about Abraham which largely correspond to the Biblical story although the Qur'an also contains some novel features, including the claim that Abraham, together with Ishmael, built the Ka‘bah. This course will discuss how the scriptures of the three religions emerged within the same cultural milieu, and explore their intertwined histories and the ways in which Jews, Christians, and Muslims developed their own independent religious identities from their early encounters to the present. Students will also be introduced to some basic teachings of Islam. No prior knowledge of Islam is required.
ASIA 40763	What is race? How do concepts of race change according to social, political, and historical context? Do Asian understandings of race differ from those in the West? How are concepts like &quot;blackness&quot; and &quot;white privilege&quot; interpreted in Asia? In this class, we will grapple with this set of questions by looking at how competing definitions of race and nationhood emerged in conjunction with the rise of the Japanese empire (1910-1945), and American military occupation in Asia during the Cold War. Students will investigate how this historical context has continued to affect the ways more contemporary flows of migrants from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa are racialized in Asia, by analyzing sociological, anthropological, and historical texts of everyday life. No prior knowledge about Asian languages or topics is required.
ASIA 48512	Students who are contemplating graduate study in a particular area of the world or a career in international business or government-or those who are merely curious-are well served by the Minor in Asian Studies.

BES 30310	This gateway seminar for the Minor in Business and the Common Good will be limited to 24 Mendoza College students, with priority given to students intending to pursue the Minor. The seminar focuses on the place of wealth and commerce in a well-ordered life, both for the individual and the community. Among other topics, the course takes a special interest in the rich Catholic tradition of reflection on these topics, especially the Catholic social teaching relevant to business that has emerged in the last two centuries.
BES 30792	What is the role of business in a just and humane society? Many of you are about to dedicate your lives to business, and the rest of you will work, in one way or another, with business. Yet many people believe that business is a morally suspicious activity, a suspicion evident in the common belief that business people need to &quot;give back&quot; to society. Is business an activity for which one must atone? Are people right to be suspicious of business? This course is designed to engage ideas from the Catholic tradition with perspectives drawn from moral philosophy, business, and economics. We will engage issues of faith and normativity both critically and constructively. Students will consider competing positions on faith and normative questions, will reflect on (or discover elements of) their own faith or non-faith, and will describe the extent to which they believe various claims are supported by faith or reason. This course responds to Pope John Paul II's Centesimus Annus (1991) and Pope Francis's Laudato Si (2015), which called on Catholic education to &quot;safeguard the moral conditions for an authentic 'human ecology'&quot; (Centesimus Annus, 38). *FOR BUSINESS HONORS PROGRAM STUDENTS ONLY.*

BES 33702	The International Business Scholars Colloquium is a 1.5 credit undergraduate course affiliated with and organized by the Business Ethics and Society Program (BESP) at the Mendoza College of Business and the Nanovic Institute for European Studies in the Keough School of Global Affairs. The course runs for both the fall and spring semesters, 1.5 credits per semester. A small group of selected students will meet in-person weekly to discuss assigned readings, to listen to and engage with invited speakers, and to form a community of Notre Dame business and/or other students interested in global affairs (with particular emphasis on Europe), to explore the nature of honorable business within our globalized world, and the ethical and professional challenges and opportunities for pursuing business as a force for good in the international context(s). The first hour of class will be dedicated to discussion of readings or an invited speaker. During the second hour, we may have a meal together and continue informal discussion and conversation with faculty and invited practitioners. International Business Scholars will be encouraged to participate in the activities of the BESP and the Nanovic Institute beyond the Colloquium (occasional lectures, panels, etc.). As a capstone immersion experience, students may be able to participate in an international trip exploring the challenges and opportunities of business in a foreign country in the spring of 2024.  Students interested in the colloquium should contact Prof. John Sikorski to obtain instructor permission for enrollment in the colloquium (jsikors2@nd.edu). 
BES 43100	This course is a discussion-based seminar investigating a series of “economic sins.” That is, we will explore differing perspectives on a series of controversies in economics and business, such as just or fair wages, collective action problems, exploitation, asymmetry in knowledge and leverage, inequality, sweatshops, sustainability, and cronyism. How does business in a market economy give rise to such problems? How does it, or can it, address them? What is the proper role of government with respect to such issues?   Readings will draw from classical and contemporary sources in economics, philosophy, theology, political science, and business ethics, and will represent a range of perspectives.   This course is part of the Business and the Common Good minor.
BES 43200	In this course, we examine the sometimes productive, sometime corrosive, relationship between business and politics in America. To do so, we will focus on the ways in which the relationship between business and politics in America has facilitated the rise of extractive forms of exchange and rent-seeking practices at the expense of genuine value creation brought about by voluntary cooperation in productive activities. Throughout the course, then, we will pay close attention to debates—philosophical, theological, political—about the determinants of value in a market economy, including the relative voluntariness of its participants, the definition of “rents” as a kind of unproductive, and so extractive, form of economic activity, and the continuing appeal—for political and business leaders alike—of exercising managerial control over the masses, i.e., their fellow citizens. To illustrate the significance of these debates, and the social implications of the answers provided by their participants, we will investigate how America’s political class has been utilized as an instrument of extraction and rent-seeking by market actors throughout our nation’s history, covering the post-war Gilded Age, the Depression and New Deal, the deindustrialization and deunionization of the American economy in the 1970s, and the globalization of trade in the 1990s. Ultimately, students will be asked to reflect on the moral significance of the ends for which political and economic power has been deployed in an era marked by the rise of big business, the emergence of mass politics, and the expansion of public power to control its citizens.
BES 48000	The Business Honors Program Capstone Thesis is written under the direction of a regular Mendoza faculty member, with another faculty member, preferably one associated with the BHP, as a second/outside reader. The thesis should be approximately 30 pages, either an original work of scholarship or a research paper.

CHR 20101	Race is often thought of as a biological characteristic of individuals. Yet research consistently demonstrates that race, rather than a biological reality, is a social reality. This course will introduce you to how to think sociologically about race and racism. We will explore the origins of race, and the theoretical and empirical analysis of race, ethnicity, and immigration. We will also examine patterns of racial/ethnic inequality in a variety of domains including education, income and wealth, criminal justice, media, and health. Throughout the course we will view race through an intersectional lens, emphasizing the interplay between social categories such as race, ethnicity, gender, and social class. We will also discuss immigration patterns and how they affect race and ethnic relations. While we will talk about historical and global processes and patterns, most of the class will focus on racial and ethnic stratification in contemporary U.S. society (post-1960s).
CHR 30104	In 2007, after decades of organizing on the part of indigenous activists, the United Nations issued a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Declaration was the result of years of work by people from particular communities--each with its own history, culture, language, and home--who decided to call themselves, and work together as, Indigenous people. This creative step allowed indigenous peoples to work collectively for justice on a global scale, rather than individually and in confrontation with single states. This class explores the concept, and reality, of Indigeneity in both historical and contemporary perspective: we will consider the many shared struggles and opportunities of indigenous peoples around the globe today and the ways that similar (or distinct) histories have led to similar (or distinct) present realities.
CHR 30141	This course examines the origins and development of contemporary opinions and policies concerning migrations and migrants. It does so by looking backward to the age when transoceanic mobility became more frequent and increasingly more accessible before moving forward to our own times. It is the central claim of this course that it is impossible to understand what drives policy today without first surveying the changing ideas of migration and the movement of people over time. It will therefore take students through the history of migration in the modern world, as well as studying the migrant journey, connections to home, the process and difficulties of assimilation and community creation, and the problems or opportunities that could arise for migrants from characteristics like race, religion, ethnicity, or language. Also considered will be the complex relationship between colonization and migration. In the process, Migrants and Mobility will also examine how different societies place value judgments upon migrants and analyze how and why migration/migrants have been categorized as “good” or “bad” over time. Students will also encounter and consider the effects of growing urbanization and industrialization, changing demography and global trade patterns, and, more recently, the impact of climate change. Migrants and Mobility will be primarily seminar based, placing a premium on participation and analytical discussion.
CHR 30712	This course will focus on the writings of Black political thinkers in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. Through critical examination of the conditions against, and contexts within, which the political theories of these thinkers are situated, this course hopes to arrive at some understanding of the principles, goals and strategies developed to contest and redefine notions/concepts of citizenship (vis-a-vis the imperatives of race/racism and the global colonial formations), humanity, justice, equality, development, democracy, and freedom.
CHR 30715	Are human rights modern inventions or are they as old as humankind? Are they universal or culturally specific? How much progress, if any, has transnational human rights advocacy achieved? How and to what extent should human rights influence foreign policy? What are the advantages and disadvantages of encoding human rights in international law? By examining these and similar questions, this course initiates students in the study of international human rights. In addition to informative readings, intriguing podcasts, and interactive lectures the course features in-class debates on the most pressing human rights problems. 
CHR 30719	The course will examine U.S. policies and practices to combat human trafficking including how U.S. policies advance the prevention of trafficking in persons, the protection of victims and survivors and the punishment of perpetrators as a foreign policy objective of the U.S. Students will develop a basic understanding of the various aspects of and perspectives in human trafficking including domestic and international law; foreign nationals and United States Citizens; victim services, survivor aftercare and law enforcement and sex and labor trafficking. Students will also analyze international trafficking prohibitions under the various international conventions and identify current trafficking issues in the United States, with a particular focus on commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor and involuntary servitude and the range of remedies available when rights have been violated. Finally, students will identify gaps in existing remedies and formulate policies to address them.
CHR 30721	Civil Rights in the US is a living tradition that students can both understand and engage with. This course traces the non-linear, contested and ongoing history of Civil Rights in the US from the founding period to the present. It employs the perspectives of a lawyer and historian to illustrate how:  the Civil War and the end of slavery made Civil Rights in the US possible, international human rights and Civil Rights in the US have interacted over time; the complicated relationship between the definition of Civil Rights and the realization of these rights played out over time, and the tensions between the federal government and the states continue to shape Civil Rights down to the present.    The course is structured around three key historical periods in which Civil Rights in the US developed and the divisive legacy of these periods of possibility: The Founding and Constitutional period 1776-1790, Civil War and Reconstruction, 1863-1883 and the Civil Rights Era 1945-1991.  Through an examination of social movements, Supreme Court cases, and congressional action the course illustrates how the meaning of citizenship and civil rights, who constituted a citizen, and what institutions—state and local government, private individuals, and so on—posed the biggest threat to equal treatment under the law changed over time. Finally, the course provides opportunities for students to actively participate in the US Civil Rights tradition.
CHR 30722	This course provides an introduction to the history of American slavery. After examining the origins and transformation of Atlantic world slavery, the course focuses particularly on slavery in the United States. Between the American Revolution and the Civil War, the United States grew into the largest slaveholding society in the modern world. U.S. slavery's growth was driven forward by massive global economic transformations and territorial conquest. Yet, in the face of unprecedented violence, enslaved people themselves brought about the end of slavery and transformed the meaning of freedom in the United States. This course focuses on this history from the perspective of enslaved people themselves with particular attention to struggles for freedom. Through an examination of this history and its legacies, the course will introduce students to histories of resistance.
CHR 30723	Although advances in science and technology have made tremendous gains in promoting health and longevity, these achievements have not been  experienced evenly. Instead, devastating health and disability-based inequities persist, such as environmental racism and disability-based discrimination. As a result, social movement groups and organizations are fighting to protect vulnerable communities and promote civil rights. This class will therefore address how social movements have impacted the health and human rights of vulnerable social groups in the US and beyond today. To do so, we will (1) use a sociological perspective to investigate the structural determinants of health and the social construction of disabilities, and (2) investigate how advocates, activists, and organizations fight for good health and disability justice. This course will require participation in a daylong multi-fieldsite visit, weekly readings, presentations, and a final paper.
CHR 30725	More than a century before African slaves were trafficked to the Virginia colony in 1619, Christopher Columbus transported captured indigenous peoples to Spain from the New World. The dispossession and enslavement of non-Europeans in the colonization of the Americas was justified by Christians but also condemned by Christians with different economic and political interests. This development course in theology introduces students to the challenging intersection of faith, slavery, and freedom by exploring key figures, events, and movements that have shaped the complex historical legacy of Christianity in the Americas, a hemispheric past that remains ever bound together. In addition to Christianity's role in colonial expansion and racial ideology, the course especially considers how lived faith in God provided a catalyst for the empowerment and resistance of the oppressed and their advocates in shared struggles to attain greater social justice, racial equality, and political autonomy. From the &quot;Protector of the Indians&quot; Bartolomé de las Casas to César Chávez, and the &quot;Black Moses&quot; Harriet Tubman to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the course explores these and other extraordinary figures of hope in the Americas who gave their lives to protest social violence and promote authentic expressions of faith. In the course, students will engage this turbulent past through a contextual approach to theology that examines idolatry, migration, land, liberty, poverty, social sin, nonviolence, and solidarity as normative categories relevant for addressing contemporary social crises afflicting our nation and earth.
CHR 30726	Racial Justice in America is focused on the historic and current impact of racial injustice and the urgency of the work of racial justice today. Racial Justice in America will invite course participants to consider how the stories of the struggle for racial justice in the United States shapes our imaginations for the work of racial justice today. The centerpiece of this course is a required spring break immersion to major civil rights locations in the South. Additionally, students will read/reflect on how we tell the stories of racism in the United States and will create their own narrative/reflective account of their experience with racism and the civil rights movement sites.
CHR 30728	This course will examine the opportunities and challenges facing Latino communities today as they simultaneously transform and are transformed by their continuing growth in U.S. society. Through a careful examination of the biographies of leaders in Latino communities, we will examine what role they have each played in empowering Latino communities to advance in business, arts, education, community organizing, entertainment, medicine, religion, law, academia, politics, and other areas. The course will coincide with the Transformative Latino Leadership Speaker Series sponsored by the Arthur Foundation through the Institute for Latino Studies. Students in the class will have the opportunity to interact with invited leaders in several setting including the classroom, meals, receptions, and university-wide events. The primary course requirement is a research essay about the life and career of a chosen leader.
CHR 30734	Sociologists who study social movements and activism typically address questions about how disadvantaged groups are able to organize and engage in sustained protest in hopes of bringing about progressive change.   In recent years, however, we have witnessed the growth of many organizations that aim to prevent change with hopes of preserving benefits that they enjoy.  To understand this form of organized resistance to change, we need to closely examine how power operates in society to understand conditions that give rise to activism that resists progressive change.   We consider the extent to which theories designed to explain progressive activism fail to account for conservative activism.  The ultimate goal for the course is to provide you with the tools needed to formulate your own research questions and to engage with the academic literature to theorize your questions in a way that could lead to publishable research.
CHR 30735	Given the dramatic rise in mass incarceration over the last 50 years, understanding the spillover consequences of this uniquely American phenomenon has become increasingly important as a growing number of families now have direct experience with imprisonment. This course will provide a broad overview of the ripple effects of mass imprisonment on family life and how it shapes opportunity and structures disadvantage for communities, families, and especially children. This will be done through 1) exposure to mixed-media portrayals of imprisonment’s effects on family and community life and 2) the close analysis of empirical research on the spillover and intergenerational consequences of incarceration across a range of outcomes. With the concentration of imprisonment falling among poor, minority families, much of the readings in this course will focus on family life in urban communities of color, however, we will spend a little time exploring broader accounts, including those of rural communities and encourage students to consider impacts for families exposed to incarceration due to white-collar crimes.
CHR 30736	This course examines the socio-histories, movement, and settlement patterns of racial minorities in America. The course will focus on how race and racial imaginaries shape the movement and settlement of racial minorities. It will include deep examinations of these mobility patterns and how they are constructed and articulated through laws, policies, and social arrangements. Special attention will be paid to the racialization of the United States, American-ness as whiteness, and the consequences for the social and physical landscape. And finally, the course will consider how the racial construction of America is manifested and buttressed through the built environment and the consequences.
CHR 30738	Scholars and activists use the concept of the &quot;carceral state&quot; to describe the official, government use of criminalization, surveillance, and mass imprisonment to exercise control over society. This course examines the histories, cultures, politics, and economics of the US carceral state. Reading feminist scholarship from across the disciplines, we will study its genealogy — beginning with the surveillance embedded in the earliest practices of slavery and settler colonialism, tracing its development through the 19th and early 20th centuries, and concluding with the rise of the modern prison industrial complex. We will then focus on contemporary case studies including the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; immigrant detention, sex-crime regulation, and police violence. Finally, we will consider alternatives to prisons and policing, as we learn about academic research and activist movements working to end state violence, abolish prisons, defund police, and build opportunities for restorative justice. We will ask and address such questions as: How does the US carceral state function as a tool for social control? What histories, policies, and ideologies underlie the carceral state? How have individuals and organizations worked to reform, transform, or abolish the carceral state? How have media and the arts been used to normalize and/or critique the carceral state? And can we imagine a world without prisons or police?
CHR 30739	The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 26% of Americans (about 61 million people) have a disability—a physical, intellectual, sensory, or self-care impediment that affects major life activities. This course considers this population, their stories and experiences, as well as how disability—as a social, cultural, legal, and political construct—has shaped the nation and its history. A particular focus of the course will be on disability and social justice. Throughout American history, and still today, disabled people have been excluded from basic civil rights, such as voting, marrying, holding property, and living independently. This course will examine how these restrictions developed and changed over time as well as how disabled people have fought for greater access and equality. Coursework may include response papers, primary source analysis, and a final project.
CHR 30740	This class will survey the various historical and contemporary dimensions of Asian American experiences including immigration &amp; integration, family &amp; community dynamics, ethnic/gender/class identity, as well as transnational and diasporic experiences. We will explore contemporary and historical issues of racism, the model minority myth, inter-generational relationships, and the educational experiences of Asian Americans. To accomplish this, our class will pose such questions as: Who is Asian American? How did racism create Chinatown? Is there an Asian advantage? Coursework includes essays based on topics of your choice, presentations, and a creative narrative.
CHR 30741	While it is a notoriously difficult concept to define, “race” is undoubtedly a powerful force in American life. Focusing on the late nineteenth century to the present, this course examines the ways in which racial ideas are formed, negotiated, and resisted in the arenas of American literature and popular culture. From the story of racial confusion in Mark Twain’s Pudd’nhead Wilson (1894) to contemporary cultural politics of performance and appropriation, this course will ask how popular culture actively shapes—rather than merely reflects—American ideas about race and ethnicity. A key aim of the class is to go beyond looking for “good” and “bad” pop culture texts to explore the deeper meanings of racism and antiracism. By closely engaging with a diverse set of theoretical, historical, and primary texts, students will learn to approach and analyze popular culture with a critical eye.
CHR 30742	Nearly one in four people is an immigrant or child of immigrants in the United States. This course critically examines what it means to be an immigrant or child of immigrants through interdisciplinary sources, including memoirs, blogs, art, and popular journalism. Since the liberalization of immigration policy in 1965, immigrants from Latin America and Asia are becoming an increasing and emergent demographic of American society. In major American cities such as Los Angeles and New York, they comprise over 50% of the population. This course focuses on how immigrants and the children of immigrants experience the United States. How are immigrants changing the US racial and ethnic structure? How do their experiences differ, given varying legal statuses? How is the second generation becoming American? We will explore these questions through family, media representation, religion, education, dating, and sexuality. Students will participate in a service-learning opportunity related to migration and social justice and learn skills in quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Service learning will be 2-3 hours outside of class each week.
CHR 30743	Global health is an area of study, research and practice that focuses on achieving equity in health for all people worldwide. The health status of individuals and populations arise from a myriad of complex biological, social, economic, political, and environmental factors that operate synergistically. Through a social justice lens, we will examine how these factors shape health outcomes and how interventions must be developed that include addressing the root causes of inequity. We will use a case-based approach, focusing on specific health problems in several countries, including the United States. Cases will include a variety of themes including health disparities arising from stress-associated racial discrimination, the epidemiological transition from infectious to non-communicable diseases, and how the health effects of climate change disproportionately affect the most vulnerable
CHR 30744	What is race? How do concepts of race change according to social, political, and historical context? Do Asian understandings of race differ from those in the West? How are concepts like &quot;blackness&quot; and &quot;white privilege&quot; interpreted in Asia? In this class, we will grapple with this set of questions by looking at how competing definitions of race and nationhood emerged in conjunction with the rise of the Japanese empire (1910-1945), and American military occupation in Asia during the Cold War. Students will investigate how this historical context has continued to affect the ways more contemporary flows of migrants from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa are racialized in Asia, by analyzing sociological, anthropological, and historical texts of everyday life. No prior knowledge about Asian languages or topics is required.
CHR 40114	This five-week course will examine forced migration from the perspective of the beliefs, teachings, and programmatic commitments of faith communities. The first week will be devoted to identifying the causes of and global trends in forced migration, as well as the categories of forced migrants. It will also explore the “law of migration”; that is, the diverse legal systems that migrants must negotiate on their journeys and that religious actors use to assess migration policies. The second week will explore the teachings of diverse faith communities on forced migration, their understanding of this immense and growing phenomenon, and their programmatic and policy responses. The third week will segue to state-centered approaches to the governance and management of migration, with a focus on the concepts of sovereignty and the rule of law. It will also consider ideologies such as nativism and exclusionary nationalism that are in tension with the beliefs, policy positions, and programs of religious actors. The fourth week will be devoted to guest speakers and student presentations on situations of protracted displacement throughout the world. Persons in protracted displacement have lived in exile for at least five years and have no viable course out of their “long lasting and intractable status of limbo.” The fifth week will be devoted to US refugee protection trends and policies.
CHR 40590	Is it possible to think of the 21st century as a post-racial, post-feminist world? In her provocative 2012 study, Body as Evidence: Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender, Janell Hobson suggests that rather than having been eradicated, millennial hopes that the historical difficulties represented by race and gender have lost their significance in the present day are as far, if not even further away from the mark as they have ever been. For Hobson, policing the body, whether that be in terms of its race, its gender, or its sexuality, has remained paramount. &quot;[W]hile the early-twenty-first century discourse of 'postracial' and 'postfeminist' often declares the loss of meaning attached to race and gender,&quot; she argues, &quot;..the global scope of our media-reliant information culture insists on perpetuating raced and gendered meanings that support ideologies of dominance, privilege, and power.&quot; In Hobson's view, the body and how it is imagined rests at the center of such ideologies, pointing also to a number of crucial questions that become particularly important when considering the significance of race and gender through the lens of modernity. How might a reconsideration of race point also to a rethinking of gender and vice-versa? What does race actually mean? How does/can it alter the way we understand gender? Is it possible to think race beyond the idea of race? What might a new conception of race actually look like, and how might this influence our thinking on gender? How are the problems of race and gender intertwined, and how is/has the body been imagined in and through them? What can such questions tell us about today's racial and gendered realities, both inside and outside the university, both in the past and the present? This course takes a step backward to investigate these and other like questions in the context of the utopic impulse and its emphasis on the imagination in several 19th-century American authors whose work may be viewed as participating in a broad yet under-acknowledged vision of race, gender and Atlantic modernity that seeks to interrogate hierarchies of race and gender as these have been constructed and maintained within dominant ideologies. Grounding our analysis in a number of 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century political philosophical texts on law and utopia and drawing on insights from critical race theory, gender studies, feminist theory, theories of law and literature, and utopian studies, our goal will be to gain a more nuanced understanding of our racialized past and its troubled link to questions of gender both then and now, so that we may better hope to imagine - and reimagine - the shape of our collective democratic future in the 21st century's global community. Course Texts: To be determined, but will most likely include some of the following, either in their entirety or in the form of relevant excerpts: Plato's Republic; Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince; Thomas More, Utopia; Francis Bacon, The New Atlantis; James Harrington, 
CLAS 13186	Introduces first-year students to the study of classical literature on a comparative basis with readings from Greco-Roman literature.
CLAS 20065	Have you ever encountered something or someone exceptional in your life? If you were lucky enough to have such an experience, how did you communicate it to your family, friends and schoolmates? Did you give specific details about this encounter, or did you rather focus on your own emotions at that time? In the Greco-Roman and Biblical world, many people had exceptional encounters mostly with gods and divine-like figures. Most of these encounters are conveyed to us in the form of engaging narratives, which will be the focus of this class. We will start from accounts of divine encounters in human life, ranging from Homeric Hymns to the Biblical stories of Abraham, and from the Gospel narratives down to Apuleius' Metamorphoses, the story of a man transformed into an ass and then saved by the Egyptian goddess Isis. Then, we will focus on the Biblical and tragic stories of unjust sufferers such as Job and Oedipus, who, motivated by the desire to understand their suffering, decided to talk with God and the Olympian gods respectively. Finally, we will explore stories whose narrators struggle to provide details of their encounters with gods because the divine presence is beyond human time and space, and therefore their accounts are filled with chronological disorder and repetition. Here Aristides' account of the dreams in which the god Asclepius appeared to him will be followed by Longus' providential story of Daphnis and Chloe, and by a selection of early Christian martyrdom stories. We will conclude the class watching some movies such as the Truman Show, Les Misérables, and Mel Gibson’s Passion, and a selection from the TV Series The Chosen to explore the most popular medium which narrates stories of human encounters with the gods and the Biblical God in our contemporary era. The entire class will be discussion-based, so that we will help each other to become immersed into the world of ancient (and contemporary) stories about the divine. I hope this class will highlight the differences between Greek, Roman and Biblical responses to the gods, and reflect on the way in which each of us understands and narrates the exceptional encounters of our own life.
CLAS 20203	This course examines the history of the Roman Empire, from the establishment of a veiled monarchy under Augustus to the Christianization of the empire following the reign of Constantine (ca. 1st century B.C. to 5th century A.D). Throughout the course, we will analyze and interpret ancient textual and archaeological evidence, from both Italy and the provinces, to assess the multi-faceted institutions and cultures of the Roman people. This body of material includes the writings of emperors (Augustus, Marcus Aurelius) and ancient historians (Tacitus, Suetonius, Ammianus Marcellinus), as well as the personal letters of Pliny to the emperor Trajan. Major themes discussed in the course include the nature of despotism, dynasties and the problem of succession; imperial governance of the Mediterranean (central, provincial, and local); cultural diversity and acculturation (so-called &quot;Romanization&quot;); religions and the imperial cult (worship of the Roman emperor); citizenship; urbanism, politics, and the economy; mortality and ecology; and the discrepant identities of women, children, slaves, freedmen, and freeborn under the imperial system of Rome.
CLAS 20340	Humans have told stories about sprawling battles, voyages across the world, and larger-than-life heroes for thousands of years. Why are tales of such gigantic proportion so impactful for the individual? What about the human experience is captured so thrillingly by myths spanning years and miles? In this introductory-level class, we will read excerpts from the epic literature of ancient Greece and Rome in order to explore these questions and many more. We will encounter cosmic creation and political foundation through Hesiod's Theogony and Virgil's Aeneid, the enormity of war and its aftermath in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and stories of quests, magic, and transformation in the Argonautica by Apollonius of Rhodes and Ovid's Metamorphoses. We will also take a look outside Greece and Rome to compare large-scale storytelling in different cultures, and outside the conventional examples of epic to compare the traditions of the genre to authors who play with those traditions. In all of our readings, we will collaboratively confront what the genre of ‘epic' means, the cultural contexts of its production, and the profound impact it still has on audiences today.
CLAS 30027	In the modern world, sports and sport-like spectacles are a source of livelihood, entertainment, and social interaction for huge swathes of the global population. Fans and practitioners of physical feats of strength were likewise a major component of ancient Greco-Roman society, from the earliest Olympic Games at the dawn of Greek history to the gladiatorial contests and chariot races that characterized the most decadent phases of the Roman Empire. The purpose of this course is to provide an interdisciplinary examination of the origin and nature of sport and spectacle in the Classical world and to compare the role that athletics played in ancient society to the position it occupies in our own lives - from the point of view of athletes, spectators, and patrons alike. Topics covered will include: Near Eastern precursors to Greco-Roman sport; the development of Greek and Roman sport and spectacle through time, the Olympic Games; the role of religious thought in ancient sport; the position of the athlete within society; ancient and modern rewards for athletic valor; athletes in architecture, literature, and art; and the political appropriation of athletes and athletics. The course will focus mostly on formal athletic contests in ancient Greece and on athletic spectacles in ancient Rome, but general recreation and physical education will be considered as well.
CLAS 30210	An introduction to the nature and influence of Roman law, one of the most celebrated and distinctive elements of ancient Roman culture. The course surveys the development of Roman civil and criminal law from the very early and enigmatic &lt;i&gt;Twelve Tables&lt;/i&gt; to the very late and amazingly great &lt;i&gt;Digest of Justinian&lt;/i&gt;. Topics covered include legal procedures, the creation of law, and Roman jurisprudence, all of which are studied in the broad context of Roman government and administration. The lasting effects of Roman law on modern legal systems are also considered. 
CLAS 32027	A weekly discussion group for those registered for CLAS 30027, Sport and Society in the Ancient World.
CLAS 33022	In ancient and medieval texts the soul is the principle of life, of sense-perception, emotions, passions, rational thought and ethical behavior. Throughout history, the investigation of the soul has been special in two ways. First of all, we are not addressing an external topic; we are treating ourselves. Secondly, this study of ourselves is not merely meant to describe and analyze, but to change and to form. Ancient philosophers thought of their work as &quot;care of the soul&quot;. The soul is not a mechanism or machine, but something living which can err and go wrong. Pre-modern authorities often described this in the terms of sickness: The body may be sick and need the help of the doctor, and the soul may need therapy if it is sick.In the course, we will address a selection of texts and topics from ancient and medieval sources (Plato, Aristotle, Galen, the Stoics, Neoplatonic authors and Christian authors from late Antiquity and the Middle Ages), and compare them with select contemporary texts. What constitutes a healthy soul? What are the sicknesses of the soul? What therapies are recommended? How can one build resilience and how much resilience is right? What role does gender play? The course will also integrate lectures/discussions with practicing therapists and a field trip to &quot;mindworks&quot; (Chicago Museum of cognitive psychology).
CLAS 40305	"This course provides an in-depth introduction to the archaeology of the ancient Greek world, focusing on the Classical, Hellenistic and Early Roman Imperial periods (ca. 480 BC to <a href=""/search/?p=AD%20138"" data-action=""result-detail"" data-group=""code:AD 138""  class=""notoffered"">AD 138</a>). The survey of material culture traces the development of architecture, painting, sculpture, coinage, and other archaeological material in relation to cultural, political, social and philosophical issues. The course explores the urban, sacred, rural, funerary and provincial landscapes of Greece and introduces students to the analysis and interpretation of archaeological sites, monuments, artifacts, and art. Topics include the Athenian Acropolis in the age of Pericles, the masterpieces of Praxiteles and Lysippos, the creation of the Roman province of Greece under Augustus, and Hadrian's Roman Agora in Athens, as well as the methods, results, and theory of archaeological research in the areas of field excavation and intensive surface survey. Through the material record, the course attempts to reconstruct what life might have been like in ancient Greece."
CLAS 40820	Herodotus has been called both the &quot;Father of History&quot; and the &quot;Father of Lies.&quot;  Thucydides is revered by some as the first &quot;scientific&quot; historian; others deny him the title of historian altogether.  The most famous tales in Roman history come from the early books of Livy, and yet it is unlikely that he had any way of obtaining reliable information for that period.    The historians of the classical Greek and Roman world stand among the greatest writers of the Western tradition.  But to what extent were they performing the task that we call &quot;history?&quot;  How did the ancient historians envision their project?  What claims to knowledge did history make, and how did these differ from other forms of knowledge?  In this course we will survey (in English translation) the works of seven of the major historians of ancient Greece and Rome:  the Greek authors Herodotus, Thucydides, and Polybius, and the Roman authors Sallust, Livy, Tacitus, and Ammianus Marcellinus.  Our survey will take us through a vast expanse of time (the 5th century BC to the 4th century AD) and space (from Iberia to the Russian steppe, from the North Sea to North Africa).  We will examine the origins of ancient historiography, the methods espoused and practiced by Greek and Roman historians, the effect of political and social changes on the writing of history, the place and purpose of history in Greek and Roman culture, and the relationship of ancient historical writing to that of modern scholars.

CLGR 10002	This two-semester sequence of courses introduces students to the language of the ancient Greeks for the first time. It emphasizes the fundamentals of ancient Greek grammar and vocabulary, and prepares students to read original Greek texts. An appreciation for ancient Greek culture is also fostered through secondary readings and class discussion.
CLGR 30012	Herodotus has been called both the &quot;Father of History&quot; and the father of lies. His Histories, written in the second half of the fifth century BCE, is one of our earliest fully-surviving Greek prose texts and our most important source for the Greco-Persian Wars. But Herodotus offers so much more than political and military narrative: ethnography, geography, religious history, political theory, rhetoric, and a welter of short stories, all delivered by a master storyteller. In this advanced Greek course, we will read a selected book of the Histories in Greek, as well as the entire work in English and a selection of modern scholarship. We will consider the historical and intellectual context, questions of genre and prose style, and the tradition of historical writing begun by Herodotus and his work.
CLGR 40011	Homer's epic poems stand at the head of the tradition of European literature; their themes and poetic style have substantially influenced the works of Dante, Milton, and many other European writers. This advanced Greek course offers close readings of passages from the Iliad and Odyssey. The selection of texts will vary with every iteration of the course. In addition to reading the Greek texts, we will discuss the poems in their historical, cultural, linguistic and literary context, and reflect on aspects of Greek religion, Greek warfare and the place of men and women in Greek society.

CLLA 10001	This Latin course initiates a two-semester sequence that introduces students to the language and culture of the ancient Romans. It emphasizes the fundamentals of Latin grammar and vocabulary, and prepares students to read original Latin texts. During the academic year, this course is taught as a hybrid course; a significant portion of the learning will be done by students working independently online. A deeper appreciation for English grammar and ancient Roman culture will be fostered through class discussion and attentive reading. This course is offered every semester.

An appreciation for ancient Roman culture is also fostered through secondary readings and class discussion.
CLLA 20003	This second-year language course builds on the work of Beginning Latin I and II.  It combines a review of grammar with careful reading of classical Latin authors such as Cicero and Ovid.  The course improves students' translating skills, introduces methods for studying Latin literature in its historical and cultural contexts, and prepares students for more advanced work in the sophisticated literature of the ancient Romans.  Offered every semester.
CLLA 30004	This course reviews major topics in Latin syntax, which students practice through compositions and specially designed, targeted readings, to the end of learning to group syntactic phenomena in sets, the fundament of quick and accurate reading.  The course also introduces students to stylistic analysis and historical syntax and semantics through a survey of exemplary texts from various stages of Latin literary history.
CLLA 30075	This course introduces students to the genre of Latin Love Elegy through close reading of the poetry of Propertius and Ovid.  We will be concerned mainly with the practice of translation, analysis of poetic meter and style, and literary interpretation.  However, our work will also involve examination of the socio-political conditions in Rome in the late 1st c. BC that provided an essential context for the development of the genre.  Related to this, we will be paying close attention to the ways in which Roman elegy constructs gender and how it defines itself in relation to other genres, especially epic.  In addition to daily translation assignments, students will recite selected poems to the class, take two semester exams and a final exam and write an essay of 5-6 pages.
CLLA 40017	In this course, students will read a wide variety of Latin texts from the Middle Ages, both prose and poetry, both stylized rhetorical texts and private documents, texts in a highly technical language, or texts in specific dialects and sociolects of medieval Latin. A different geographical focus will be chosen for each semester. The general methodological approach is careful and linguistically sensitive close-reading, with various other strategies of reading and criticism applied throughout the semester.  The main course goal is to provide students from various branches of medieval studies (graduate students and advanced undergraduates) with a core knowledge in medieval Latin and the philological analysis of Latin texts, which may serve them in their scholarly work in whichever area of the Western Middle Ages. This includes proficiency in the language itself, but also a basic knowledge of subjects such as intertextuality, textual criticism, manuscript studies, rhetoric, allegorical language, literary genres, metrics and prose rhythm.
CLLA 40054	A reading of Augustine’s Confessions, partly in Latin and in its entirety in English, with a special emphasis on close reading and precise grammatical and stylistic analysis. We will focus on understanding Confessions as a work of Latin literature and Christian philosophy, part of the great late ancient endeavor to develop new genres and styles to mirror the new belief system, yet connected to the classical world in multiple ways. In addition to the narrative itself, Augustine’s personal experience, Confessions allows the reader to gain insight into his major philosophical tenets and the conversations and controversies of his life. We will also discuss important scholarly questions (origin, historical setting, sources and parallels, biblical framework, structure, philosophical background, modern readings, etc.) and read selections of scholarly literature.
CLLA 40118	"The course is an intensive survey of Latin scripts from antiquity through the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Students will be able to accurately read and transcribe Latin scripts, expand systems of abbreviation, identify, date, and localize (when possible) different hands, and defend their interpretations. There will be a strong emphasis on the different varieties of Gothic script (textualis, cursiva, hybrida).Once the class reaches the twelfth century, students will work extensively with Notre Dame¹s medieval collection of codices and fragments.

CLLA 40510	This class offers an overview of Latin literature from its origins in the 3rd century to the late Republic. During this period, as the poet Horace put it, Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit &quot;Captured Greece captured her savage conqueror&quot;: Greek literary forms - epic, drama, historiography and rhetoric - provided the models for literature in Latin.  But these adaptations were never simple copies: the values of the Romans' militarist and hierarchical society lie close to the surface.  Furthermore the values of that society were hardly static but themselves developed as Rome grew from a regional power into a world empire.  The chief purpose of this class is to grasp the dual identity of Roman literature: what does it owe to the Greek world? and what does it owe to its own developing social world?  Additional topics include the history of the Latin morphology and syntax and the development of Latin meters, especially the hexameter.  Authors to be read include Plautus, Naevius, Ennius, Terence, Cicero, Lucretius, Caesar, Sallust and Catullus.
CLLA 46801	Individual or small group study under the direction of a departmental faculty member.
CLLA 60001	This Latin course initiates a two-semester sequence that introduces students to the language and culture of the ancient Romans. It emphasizes the fundamentals of Latin grammar and vocabulary, and prepares students to read original Latin texts. During the academic year, this course is taught as a hybrid course; a significant portion of the learning will be done by students working independently online. A deeper appreciation for English grammar and ancient Roman culture will be fostered through class discussion and attentive reading. This course is offered every semester.
CLLA 60002	This two-semester sequence of courses introduces students to the language of the ancient Romans for the first time. It emphasizes the fundamentals of Latin grammar and vocabulary, and prepares students to read original Latin texts. An appreciation for ancient Roman culture is also fostered through secondary readings and class discussion.
CLLA 60003	This second-year language course builds on the work of Beginning Latin I and II.  It combines a review of grammar with careful reading of classical Latin authors such as Cornelius Nepos and Ovid.  The course improves students' translating skills, introduces methods for studying Latin literature in its historical and cultural contexts, and prepares students for more advanced work in the sophisticated literature of the ancient Romans.  Offered each fall semester.
CLLA 60004	This course reviews major topics in Latin syntax, which students practice through compositions and specially designed, targeted readings, to the end of learning to group syntactic phenomena in sets, the fundament of quick and accurate reading.  The course also introduces students to stylistic analysis and historical syntax and semantics through a survey of exemplary texts from various stages of Latin literary history.

CLLA 60075	This course introduces students to the genre of Latin Love Elegy through close reading of the poetry of Propertius and Ovid.  We will be concerned mainly with the practice of translation, analysis of poetic meter and style, and literary interpretation.  However, our work will also involve examination of the socio-political conditions in Rome in the late 1st c. BC that provided an essential context for the development of the genre.  Related to this, we will be paying close attention to the ways in which Roman elegy constructs gender and how it defines itself in relation to other genres, especially epic.

CNST 20002	This course surveys the basic institutions and practices of American politics. The goal of the course is to gain a more systematic understanding of American politics that will help you become better informed and more articulate. The course examines the institutional and constitutional framework of American politics and identifies the key ideas needed to understand politics today. The reading and writing assignments have been designed not only to inform you, but also to help develop your analytic and research skills. The themes of the course include the logic and consequences of the separation of powers, the build-in biases of institutions and procedures, the origins and consequence of political reforms, and recent changes in American politics in the 21st century. This semester we will emphasize the significance of the upcoming 2016 elections, and the course will include election-related assignments. Although the course counts toward the Political Science major and will prepare prospective majors for further study of American politics, its primary aim is to introduce students of all backgrounds and interests to the information, ideas, and academic skills that will enable them to understand American politics better and help them become more thoughtful and responsible citizens.
CNST 20200	This course will focus on the relationship between democratic institutions, peace, and economic/human development. While drawing on lessons from North America and Europe, we will focus largely on countries of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. During the semester, we will discuss and debate the merits of various explanations or hypotheses that political scientists have proposed to answer the following questions: Why are some countries more &quot;developed&quot; and democratic than others? Is development necessary for democracy or democracy necessary for development? What is the relationship between culture, development, and democracy?  How do different types of political institutions affect the prospects for development and democracy? Should/how should U.S. and other established democracies promote democratization? By the end of the course, the objectives are that students (1) learn the most important theories intended to explain why some countries are more democratic and &quot;developed&quot; than others, (2) understand the complexity of any relationship between democracy and development, and (3) grow in the ability to think about and intelligently assess the strengths and weaknesses of strategies intended to promote democracy and development.
CNST 20403	Introduction to Criminology provides students with an overview of the sociological study of law making, law breaking and the resulting social responses. In  this class we not only look at a variety of crimes, but we also discuss the varying methods sociologists use to collect, interpret and evaluate data, as well as how we theorize about crime and punishment. We address questions such as &quot;Why are some people or groups labeled as criminal, while others are not?&quot; &quot;Do laws in both their construction and enforcement serve everyone's interests equally?&quot; &quot;How can the communities in which people are embedded be considered as criminogenic?&quot; &quot;How are poverty, race, gender and other social factors related to crime?&quot;
CNST 20602	This course is an introduction to political theory as a tradition of discourse and as a way of thinking about politics. The course surveys selected works of political theory and explores some of the recurring themes and questions that political theory addresses, especially the question of justice. This introductory course fulfils the political theory breadth requirement for the political science major.
CNST 20615	This course examines the history of the Roman Empire, from the establishment of a veiled monarchy under Augustus to the Christianization of the empire following the reign of Constantine (ca. 1st century B.C. to 5th century A.D). Throughout the course, we will analyze and interpret ancient textual and archaeological evidence, from both Italy and the provinces, to assess the multi-faceted institutions and cultures of the Roman people. This body of material includes the writings of emperors (Augustus, Marcus Aurelius) and ancient historians (Tacitus, Suetonius, Ammianus Marcellinus), as well as the personal letters of Pliny to the emperor Trajan. Major themes discussed in the course include the nature of despotism, dynasties and the problem of succession; imperial governance of the Mediterranean (central, provincial, and local); cultural diversity and acculturation (so-called &quot;Romanization&quot;); religions and the imperial cult (worship of the Roman emperor); citizenship; urbanism, politics, and the economy; mortality and ecology; and the discrepant identities of women, children, slaves, freedmen, and freeborn under the imperial system of Rome. 
CNST 30003	This course begins in 1848 and examines the coming of the Civil War, the experience of the war itself, and the period of Reconstruction up to 1877. The emphasis will be on the political, social, cultural, and legal events and decisions that were made by governmental and civilian participants, by men and women, by whites and blacks. Why were so many willing to go to war? What did they believe each side was fighting for? The sectional conflict touched every aspect of American life. In order to understand it fully, we will read not only political speeches, military reports, and judicial decisions, but also poetry, fiction, and private letters. We will examine the beliefs and values of veterans and nurses, of abolitionists and slave owners, of politicians and voters. We will also consider the way historians evaluate the war and the way in which the public remembers it.
CNST 30012	When speaking of the American Revolution, many writers reach for a comment made by John Adams in 1818 that, &quot;[T]he Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. . .&quot; Whether this assertion is true historically or not, it still does not adequately describe what that revolution was. The American Revolution obviously had its political elements, primarily the formation of the United States. To reach its political goals, military means were necessary. Without a successful War for Independence, there would have been no revolution. To leave matters there, however, would be insufficient. A fuller understanding of the revolution would need to address how it affected the whole spectrum of American life. It would consider the revolution as a social movement that challenged the political and social hierarchies of the day. It would also ask how the revolution affected those who were not white males, especially women, slaves, and Native Americans. Without considering the possible negative implications of the revolution, any telling would be incomplete. This class will take up these challenges and attempt to make a full-orbed presentation of the events surrounding the American Revolution. It will introduce students both to elites and to those whom the popular narrative glosses over. It will attempt to count the losses, as well as the gains, which flowed from the move to independence from Britain. Finally, it will attempt to describe the many changes through this period, which resulted, not only in a new political nation, but in a new society and culture--changes that in varying degrees are still with us today and of which contemporary Americans are the inheritors.
CNST 30016	This course offers an overview of the interaction between Catholics and public life in America during the half century following the Second Vatican Council and the election of a Catholic as President in 1960. The course should permit students to gain a greater familiarity with the engagement and response of various Catholic individuals and groups on some major political and social-cultural issues. It will explore the extent of Catholic influence in American politics and society during the period and will explore the role of religion in shaping (or not shaping) the outlooks of a number of significant Catholic political figures beginning with JFK, RFK, and Eugene McCarthy, moving to Mario Cuomo and Daniel Patrick Moynihan down to contemporary figures. The course offers each student the opportunity to research and write a major paper on a topic of his or her choosing in this area.
CNST 30025	This course introduces students to the dynamics of the social and historical construction of race and ethnicity in American political life. The course explores the following core questions: What are race and ethnicity? What are the best ways to think about the impact of race and ethnicity on American citizens? What is the history of racial and ethnic formation in American political life? How do race and ethnicity link up with other identities animating political actions like gender and class? What role do American political institutions the Congress, presidency, judiciary, state and local governments, etc. play in constructing and maintaining these identity categories? Can these institutions ever be used to overcome the points of division in American society? 
CNST 30032	This course asks how we should narrate and understand the great ordeal of Civil War and emancipation. Reading both primary and secondary sources, it considers the Civil War era and life of Abraham Lincoln in light of the rise of abolition and antislavery politics; attitudes toward race, slavery, and labor; the political and social meanings of war and emancipation; the political and social challenge of reconstructing the nation amidst the tangled legacies of racial slavery and a destructive war. 
CNST 30033	Sixty years ago, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, in broad daylight, in the presence of hundreds of witnesses, while traveling in his presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas, Texas. On that day, a historic presidency came to a tragic end. Two days later, the alleged assassin (Lee Harvey Oswald) was murdered by a Dallas nightclub owner (Jack Ruby) while being escorted from his cell by a host of police officers, raising the possibility of a conspiracy. The official investigation into Kennedy's assassination (&quot;The Warren Report&quot;) was met with fierce public skepticism, precipitating numerous Congressional investigations that revealed extensive covert operations (both in the US and abroad) conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that would have been relevant to those charged with investigating the assassination. When combined with an already heightened public skepticism of the assassination itself, these revelations proved to be an enduring catalyst for a slow and steady decline of public trust in government that continues unabated to our present day. In this course, we examine the origins and rise of the &quot;security state&quot; in the United States, its role in significant events in the Kennedy presidency, including the investigation into his assassination, and the extent of its power both before and after Kennedy's presidency. Ultimately, students will be asked whether and to what extent the demands of national security conflict with the constitutional prerogatives of a representative democracy.
CNST 30034	This proposed course would cover a lot of constitutional terrain involved in the area of criminal justice, from investigative steps through trial and sentencing. It would cover significant issues in 4 th , 5 th , 6 th and 8 th Amendment law as well as situating them within broader philosophical concerns about justice, Catholic Social Teaching, and the questions of race.
CNST 30035	America, at its core, is an idea. The lands that became America have been imagined and in certain ways and constantly reimagined. The history of the ideas that made America is less a lesson in philosophy and more about a series of clashes between contending visions: Democracy vs. Republicanism; Free vs. Slave; Christian vs. Secular; Individual vs. Society; and Universal vs. Particular. This course traces a long arc from the Puritans to the Culture Wars to understand the ideas Americans draw upon to comprehend the world and act in it. Lectures and discussions will consider the notions of equality, democracy, pluralism, religious freedom, and the tensions between contending visions for America. Readings for this course will include autobiographies, speeches, sermons, canonical texts, lyrics, novels, newspaper articles, and poetry.
CNST 30242	Between the early rumblings of the Reformations and the last cannon shot of World War I, Europeans profoundly changed how they conceptualized bodies as experience and metaphors. During these four centuries, Europeans grounded the ways in which they interacted with each other and the world in bodily imaginings. On an individual level, the living, human body provided a means of accessing and understanding the material or spiritual world. On a collective scale, the physical body, its adornments, and its gestures provided markers that Europeans used to fracture society along axes of gender, sexuality, class, race, mental aptitude, and even sacrality. Drawing in part from their myriad imaginings of the human body, Europeans constructed metaphorical political bodies. The body politic assumed diverse forms spanning from divine right monarchs to revolutionary republics to modern nation states. Our course will lay bare the human body as culturally constructed, while fleshing out how Europeans? evolving visions affected political imaginings.
CNST 30414	This course offers a broad thematic overview of the history of capitalism from the early sixteenth century up to the late 1980s. As a discussion-based seminar, we will devote most of our conversations to discovering, analyzing and reflecting on the transformation of the U.S. from a newly-independent British colony, to the most influential economic power in the world. Topics and themes we will consider include: the rise of early modern transnational capitalism, European imperialism and trade, and indigenous dispossession after 1492; science and technological transformations; social and economic thought; slavery and servitude, broadly construed; and characteristics of prosperity, wealth, and economic flux.     Our readings and viewings will be a mix of scholarly and primary sources, including an abundance of canonical literary and artistic material, such as novels, visual art, and film excerpts (e.g. Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House (1879), Aaron Douglas's Building More Stately Mansions (1944), and Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence (1920)). Over the course of the semester, students will draw upon this eclectic combination of sources to synthesize the dominant historical dimensions of capitalism in and beyond the U.S. via four short essays (4 - 5 pages, double-spaced-between 1,100 and 1,400 words), and a final paper (10 - 12 pages, double-spaced) based on cumulative texts.
CNST 30431	Although the mass media is not formally part of the U.S. government, it is arguably the most powerful institution shaping public attitudes, creating and producing information, and communicating political information to individual citizens. Almost all exposure to politics comes not from direct experience but from mediated stories. And, with the rise of the Internet, the growth of 24-hour cable news, and the decline of the &quot;Big Three&quot; television networks has created, a more diffuse media environment has been created. The primary purpose of this course is to analyze the role of the media in American politics and its relationship with the public, government, and candidates for office in a democratic society.
CNST 30435	This course will examine ways that law structures, promotes, and governs the practice of democracy in America. Topics include key features of the American constitution, including federalism, bicameralism, the separation of powers, and judicial review; the First Amendment and the freedoms of speech and press; voting rights, elections, parties, and campaigns; and the changes caused and challenges posted by technological and other developments.  This course will be taught by a member of the Notre Dame Law School faculty. It is designed and intended for undergraduates, without legal training, but it will be taught in a manner typical for law schools and will involve engagement with, and close reading of, legal texts. 
CNST 30436	This course is a discussion-based seminar investigating a series of “economic sins.” That is, we will explore differing perspectives on a series of controversies in economics and business, such as just or fair wages, collective action problems, exploitation, asymmetry in knowledge and leverage, inequality, sweatshops, sustainability, and cronyism. How does business in a market economy give rise to such problems? How does it, or can it, address them? What is the proper role of government with respect to such issues? Readings will draw from classical and contemporary sources in economics, philosophy, theology, political science, and business ethics, and will represent a range of perspectives. This course is part of the Business and the Common Good minor.
CNST 30437	In this course, we examine the sometimes productive, sometime corrosive, relationship between business and politics in America. To do so, we will focus on the ways in which the relationship between business and politics in America has facilitated the rise of extractive forms of exchange and rent-seeking practices at the expense of genuine value creation brought about by voluntary cooperation in productive activities. Throughout the course, then, we will pay close attention to debates—philosophical, theological, political—about the determinants of value in a market economy, including the relative voluntariness of its participants, the definition of “rents” as a kind of unproductive, and so extractive, form of economic activity, and the continuing appeal—for political and business leaders alike—of exercising managerial control over the masses, i.e., their fellow citizens. To illustrate the significance of these debates, and the social implications of the answers provided by their participants, we will investigate how America’s political class has been utilized as an instrument of extraction and rent-seeking by market actors throughout our nation’s history, covering the post-war Gilded Age, the Depression and New Deal, the deindustrialization and deunionization of the American economy in the 1970s, and the globalization of trade in the 1990s. Ultimately, students will be asked to reflect on the moral significance of the ends for which political and economic power has been deployed in an era marked by the rise of big business, the emergence of mass politics, and the expansion of public power to control its citizens.
CNST 30619	“Democracy &amp; Virtue?” investigates a simple question: Does democracy foster virtue? The class will approach this question, first, through a philosophical investigation of the nature of political regimes, including democratic regimes. This investigation will take place via a careful reading of and discussions about Plato’s Republic. The class will then turn to an examination of America as a modern constitutional democracy. Our primary text for this part of class will be Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. Additional readings from Montesquieu, The Federalist, and Catholic writers will also be introduced. Students should expect to read carefully and deliberately and to participate extensively in class, which will be conducted as a seminar conversation.
CNST 30638	This seminar-style course will examine foundational questions of constitutional order. We will begin from debates about the nature of political society among contemporary thinkers, J'rgen Habermas, Pope Benedict, John Rawls, and Carl Schmitt. We will then focus on key Ancient, Medieval, and Modern thinkers: Aristotle, Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and the Federalist writers. Our aim will be to attain clarity about the questions that are fundamental to every constitutional order, especially the character of our &quot;original&quot; or pre-political condition, the status of war and peace, the nature of political authority and law, and the proper ends of political community. This course also serves as a gateway course for the Constitutional Studies Minor.
CNST 30641	This course will examine the many ways in which religion has been fused into American politics. In doing so, we will also explore the rising tide of secularism in the United States, which many argue has resulted from a backlash to the fusion of religion and conservative politics. Then it will turn to trying to solve the puzzle of America's religious pluralism—if religion is so politically divisive, why are Americans so accepting of (most) religions other than their own? What explains the exceptions to that acceptance? What are the implications of a secularizing America for religious pluralism?
CNST 30644	This course will focus on the writings of Black political thinkers in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. Through critical examination of the conditions against, and contexts within, which the political theories of these thinkers are situated, this course hopes to arrive at some understanding of the principles, goals and strategies developed to contest and redefine notions/concepts of citizenship (vis-a-vis the imperatives of race/racism and the global colonial formations), humanity, justice, equality, development, democracy, and freedom.
CNST 30701	The &quot;Core Texts in Citizenship &amp; Constitutional Government'' course sequence offers a select group of students an opportunity to study some of the seminal texts in history and philosophy of constitutional government.
CNST 50002	In &quot;Constitutionalism, Law &amp; Politics II: American Constitutionalism,&quot; we shall study fundamental texts of the American constitutional and political tradition in an attempt to answer questions such as: What is the purpose of government? What is the meaning of political equality? What is political liberty and how is it best secured? Since we lack the time for a comprehensive survey of American political thinkers, we shall examine select statesmen and critical historical periods, focusing on the Founding era, Lincoln and the slavery crisis, and the Progressive era and New Deal.
CSC 23200	Students will work with a South Bend neighborhood to explore a structural challenge and, with the guidance of a local artist, respond to this challenge alongside community members in creating an artistic piece that serves the good of the neighborhood. This seminar will also provide a &quot;hands-on&quot; experience as students are exposed to practices of participatory research methods and the art-making process.
CSC 23915	Students selected to participate in the ND Bridge summer program enroll in this course exploring the ethics of encounter in local, domestic, and global contexts. Students will develop their awareness of what justice looks like in society, how systemic injustice is perpetuated by division, self centeredness, apathy, etc., and a growing sense of their role as agents of social change. Previously held ideas around identity, politics, and culture will be interrogated. The course will enable students to competently practice contemplation and action, as informed by the principles of ethical encounter, personally and professionally.
CSC 30951	This interdisciplinary research lab enlists students in the efforts of the Just Wage Initiative (JWI), a collaborative research and advocacy project of the Higgins Labor Program at the Center for Social Concerns. Students will help develop, refine, and update the Just Wage Framework, a multistakeholder online tool designed to advance a more inclusive and equitable economy. Students will also undertake research projects connecting their own intellectual interests and disciplinary expertise to the JWI's foundational question: What makes any given wage just or unjust? In addition, students will collaborate with the instructor and local, national, and international practitioners to envision and execute collaborative research and advocacy campaigns to promote a just wage economy. Extended weekly class sessions will feature visits by scholars and activists, as well as facilitate interactive group discussions and collaborative experiments.
CSC 30952	In 1964, when Martha Reeves sang, &quot;Calling out around the world/Are you ready for a brand new beat?/Summer's here and the time is right/For dancing in the street,&quot; was she beckoning listeners to join a party or the civil rights struggle? Or both? From spirituals sung by enslaved workers to protest anthems shouted at union rallies, music has provided the soundtrack to social justice causes throughout American History. Whether performed by rank-and-file reformers or famous recording artists -- from Frank Sinatra to Nina Simone to Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, and beyond -- popular music has accompanied and sometimes fueled transformations in American politics, culture, and social life. In this course students will explore American popular music in its many forms -- blues, country, jazz, folk, rock, punk, disco, hip hop, tejano, and more -- to understand its power and limits as both a force for social change and a window into major themes of the American experience.
CSC 33304	Racial Justice in America is focused on the historic and current impact of racial injustice and the urgency of the work of racial justice today. Racial Justice in America will invite course participants to consider how the stories of the struggle for racial justice in the United States shapes our imaginations for the work of racial justice today. The centerpiece of this course is a required spring break immersion to major civil rights locations in the South. Additionally, students will read/reflect on how we tell the stories of racism in the United States and will create their own narrative/reflective account of their experience with racism and the civil rights movement sites.
CSC 33310	This course explores the interaction of thinking and action for justice, of cognitive science and social change. In this contested moment, how might we examine the ideas with which we think as we envision social transformation and work toward solidarity and the common good? We will draw from psychology and neuroscience to understand how to overcome attribution errors, implicit bias, and motivated reasoning in work to promote justice. We will examine how assumptions about knowledge and our theories of mind impact our communication and work, and explore epistemic justice (who is invited to the table of knowledge). We will explore, in seminar format, means to promote intellectual humility, ethical imagination, practical wisdom, and commitment to action. Students will be encouraged to learn through experience and community engagement, and apply the lessons of the course in their own journeys.
CSC 33312	This research lab will employ an interdisciplinary approach to research on a range of issues related to mass incarceration. Collaborating with faculty, scholars, activists, practitioners, those impacted by systems of incarceration, and other classmates, students will develop, refine and implement a research project which contributes to the overall body of scholarship on incarceration. Students will be able to design projects (exploring moral, normative, and/or empirical etc. dimensions of incarceration) which connect their own academic and intellectual interests to emerging research questions at the Center for Social Concerns. This research lab is open to students in all disciplines.

DESN 40120	MATERIALS FEE. The course develops an understanding of what data means to humans and how does its visualization helps communicate ideas in the fields of medicine, technology and social sciences. The course touches upon measurement, collection and reporting, analysis but ultimately focuses on visualization. Visualization is when the data comes alive and is ready to be used to communicate a complex concept be it numeric, spatial, process or temporal. Types of data covered in this course include but are not limited to: geographical, cultural, scientific, financial, statistical, meteorological, natural, and transportation data. The goal of the exercises within this course is to understand how data can be used to tell a story as opposed to merely packaging and plotting a set of numbers on a page. The design process is therefore exploring the static, dynamic, interactive or 3-dimensional and performance formats of representation and understand why a certain format is more or less suitable for the nature of data, its analysis and therefore its representation. Students develop an understanding of how the graphics being used must correlate completely with the data and numbers that are being represented. The course traverses through these considerations to understand the various approaches that can be used to bring data to life and allow the viewer to understand a story that is being packaged within the representation. Is there revelation or a deeper understanding of a pattern once your data has been visualized and presented that had not been discovered earlier?

ECON 30750	In 1600, China was the richest country in the world. In 1978, China’s economy accounted for just a trivial amount of world GDP. It was agricultural, backwards, and dirt-poor. Today, its economy is second only to the U.S. The major theme for the course is to develop an understanding of these transitions and prospects for the future. Since the 1950s, society and economy have operated under a central plan. Economic and social policies have allowed Chinese people to build the world’s second largest economy. The speed and the extent of this transition for a country of this size is an economic miracle and unprecedented in history. The economic impact on human welfare has been remarkable, raising millions out of extreme poverty. China’s economic system operates under the heavy hand of an authoritarian government, run by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Economic policy decisions often reflect political reasons. Implementation and focus vary by the CCP leadership. The heavy hand of the state in economic affairs sharply contrasts with the American system.  Questions we will seek to answer include: (1) Why was China so poor in 1978? (2) How and why did the economy take off? (3) How does the China economic miracle fit within accepted economic theory? (4) Is China’s economic development and growth sustainable?

ECON 43570	Through the centuries, Catholic theologians have identified seven deadly sins:  pride, envy, anger, sloth, avarice, gluttony and lust. These sins are considered &quot;deadly&quot; as they kill the soul.  In this class, using the tools of modern economic analysis, we will consider how academics have examined the economic cause, consequence, and control of these sins. The course will be built around a series of academic readings and a special emphasis will be placed on how economists produce formal empirical tests of economic hypotheses.  Each section will begin with a writing by a Catholic theologian that outlines the nature of the sin.  Examples of topics covered in the class will be: the terrible levels of gun violence in the US (anger), the twin problems of obesity and drugs in the US (gluttony), how corruption negatively impacts economic growth (avarice), the growing ranks of idle young men in the US (sloth), markets for human trafficking (lust), the health consequences of economic inequality (envy), and the persistence differences in self-perceived ability across sexes (pride).  This is a writing intensive course where students have to produce an original piece of research that asks and answers an empirical question of interest to economists within the broad subject matter.

EG 20300	This one credit course introduces core concepts and builds competencies that are important for the development of proficient academic scholars.
EG 20560	The central idea behind this course is that engineering can and should ultimately be considered a calling from God, and not simply a discipline one joins or struggles through to achieve a lucrative career upon graduation. But how does one hear the voice of God in their training to become an engineer, especially given the technical focus of the material? the class is broadly divided into three sections. The first section promotes understanding the broader Catholic teaching on university education and the dignity of work. What is the role of the Catholic Church in educating engineering students? While technology and innovation serve a core purpose in the engineering enterprise, how does one rightly merge technical progress with Catholic position on the rights and dignity of workers, and care for God's creation? The second section moves on to the process of discernment, or hearing God's calling in our lives. Specifically, how the tools of spiritual discernment can be used to hear how to best deploy the technical skills and training of an engineering vocation. How do we make a choice about which engineering discipline to pursue? This portion of the class is based on a simple basic answer to these questions: to hear God's calling in our careers as engineers, one needs to read well and pray well. The class will explore the Catholic Church's rich store of tools for hearing and incorporating the voice of God in our work. The third section of the class focuses on engineering ethics. If we follow God's call to the engineering vocation, how should we act with integrity, compassion, and love? We will understand engineering ethics from a distinctly Christian perspective, and develop the idea that an ethical framework has a strong analogy with the engineering design process itself.

ENER 30600	In a religiously diverse and vastly troubled world, how do religious traditions motivate believers to work toward the common good? &quot;Engaging Religions,&quot; the course title, refers to three things we will examine. First, it describes how religions are intrinsically engaging: they draw in adherents by fulfilling their material, intellectual, and spiritual needs. Second, it specifies what various secular institutions like governments and development organizations must do in pursuing the common good across our planet -- most of whose inhabitants are religious. Finally, it characterizes our work in this class: exploring how various religious traditions conceptualize and work toward the common good in a global context. We will read historians, social scientists, philosophers, and critical theorists on how to analyze and interpret the role of religion in contemporary life, while examining case studies of how religious practices, beliefs, and identities intersect with issues in global affairs such as inequality, armed conflict, and climate change. In doing so, we will engage how religious traditions from the East and West -- from Asian and Abrahamic &quot;world&quot; religions, to a variety of indigenous &quot;local&quot; religions -- complicate or complement modern Catholicism's emphasis on Integral Human Development.

ENER 40113	&quot;Climate and Environmental Justice” is a lecture- and discussion-based class primarily targeted at undergraduates. It is designed to introduce you to the core and crucial concepts of climate justice and environmental justice, with a particular emphasis on existing legacy injustices and the injustices we are currently creating as environmental pollution, climate change, and human systems interact. We will discuss existing patterns of burden, inequality, poverty, and threats to human dignity, and discuss opportunities and mechanisms to repair and avoid injustice. In particular we will discuss environmental injustice as a widely experienced but largely localized experience of disproportionate burden (e.g., on the basis of race and class) associated with extraction, industrialization, and non-greenhouse gas environmental pollution, alongside climate injustice as a global and emergent phenomenon of severe and disproportionate impacts from climate change. We will address concepts of reparations and remediation, as well as governance and other strategies for enacting justice. We will also address links between climate and environmental justice with related movements focused on adaptation, energy, housing, transportation, health, and land. Our focus will be both domestic and international, with attention directed to power dynamics, vulnerabilities, and opportunities for corrective action. Climate change and the energy transition will be major themes given their deep relationship with both climate and environmental justice, particularly as processes of industrialization and deindustrialization associated with decarbonization proceed. Overall, the course will focus on patterns, drivers, and opportunities for corrective action associated with severe injustices associated with climate change and environmental burden.

The class is designed as a once-per-week session where we will spend about half the time on lectures and the other half on hands-on activities to practice LCA. The class is designed to introduce you to Life Cycle Assessment as a method for evaluating environmental, and social impacts of products, policies, systems, and services, with a focus on International Standards Organization (ISO)-compliant LCA. We will primarily be using OpenLCA, with some exposure to alternative tools. This course will particularly focus on LCA practice in the context of policy development, with emphasis on LCA’s role as a decision support tool. We will address the implications of LCA and related methods being increasingly required in policy contexts (e.g., for prioritizing grant recipients and allocating tax subsidies). We will also address the challenges associated with disparities in the maturity of various life cycle methods, most notably social LCA in comparison to environmental LCA and life cycle costing. We will evaluate published LCAs in forms like Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements, and also investigate the use of life cycle thinking and LCA for Environmental Product Declarations. The course will also emphasize the role of LCA in the energy transition, particularly given LCA’s strong role in greenhouse gas accounting, and explore how both technological and climate dynamics pose challenges for LCA practice. This course is primarily a methods course, and we will work through case studies and examples together both in and out of class, with a topical emphasis on energy, buildings, and climate due to LCA’s particular relevance in those areas.
ENER 40403	At a moment when global challenges - from climate change to inclusive development to public health threats - loom large, many nation-states seem unable to come together to address them. In what ways are the world's cities and subnational governments working on their own and in concert to meet these challenges? This course examines the distinctive roles and capacities of cities, provinces, and states in managing global policy issues and explores different modes of trans-local cooperation and coordination. We start by considering the global governance shortcomings of nation-states and exploring the multilevel character of key policy challenges. We next use case studies from different issue-areas to assess how action by subnational governments is contributing to but also complicating solutions. We conclude by discussing the limitations of subnational approaches to global challenges and considering the most appropriate policy roles and portfolios for subnational actors in the 21st century.

Special focus will be placed on the ways writing aids in the development of a sense of personal ethics, and how the practice of writing can be used as a therapeutic tool. The course will cover a wide range of genres and texts from the late 19th century to the present, with an emphasis on writings where the author is engaged in self-analysis, reflection on class, privilege, difference, and advocacy.
ENGL 20191	In literature and the humanities, we use the term theory to demarcate a way of looking at things. For example, a gender theorist insists upon the importance of gender or sexual identities, a Marxist theorist emphasizes how economic conditions affect social and political realities, and a narrative theorist examines the importance of such matters as perspective and plotting in storytelling. Rather than promoting one theoretical perspective, this course surveys numerous styles of literary theory and criticism. Students will come to understand key features and issues in topics such as: aesthetic theory; Marxism; psychoanalysis; various feminisms, gender theory and masculinity; structuralism and post-structuralism; race and ethnicity studies; and more. There is a great deal of sheer fun and surprise in learning about these various approaches. But such knowledge is also empowering, raising our consciousness concerning our own commitments and interests as readers and citizens. This course is therefore of special value to students anticipating subsequent thesis writing or graduate study in the humanities, social sciences, and law. Our principal text is The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism (3rd Ed.). It's a typically huge Norton tome but worth the wrist damage as a superb launching point into numerous areas of literary and cultural theory. Graded coursework involves several midterm papers and a final paper exploring a point of theory controversy that interests you individually, critiquing a theorist or applying a theoretical approach to a literary or cultural context of your choosing. Regular journal writings and active participation are also graded factors.
ENGL 20292	King Arthur is perhaps the most well-known figure from medieval European lore. The sheer number of movies, TV shows, and books about Arthur and his court indicate a continued and flourishing interest in Arthurian legend. But what are these contemporary writers re-making? Who exactly was Arthur? The goal of this course is not to discover the “real,” historical Arthur (although this question will certainly arise during the semester), nor is it to find the most “accurate” source for the Arthurian legend. Rather, this course aims to explore Arthur from two different angles. First, we will examine some of the foundational medieval texts that discuss Arthur and his beloved Camelot: Chretien de Troyes’s Arthurian Romances and Thomas Malory’s Le Morte D’Arthur. Second we will use more modern works—such as Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene (1596), Mark Twain’s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court, Guy Ritchie’s film King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017), and the short story collection Sword, Stone, Table (2021)—as springboards for discussing how and why people continue to write about Arthur. Although the course centers around Arthur’s character, we will of course discuss Guinevere, Merlin, Lancelot, and other residents of Arthur’s court throughout the semester.&quot;
ENGL 20301	A cliché, a painful truth, an old story, a new one—this course explores alcohol and alcoholism in Irish literature, Irish society and Irishness, examining how alcohol infuses the stories Irish people tell and those told about them, and asking what happens if we take alcohol(ism) seriously as a framework and topic of analysis. We will think about the romance and conviviality of drink and drinking, pubs and wakes and more; and counterposed crusades against drinking (by Father Mathew and others), as well as the unromantic and destructive dimension so central to recent writing. We will think about alcohol(ism) in relation to political authority and nationalism, as well as in relation to colonial resistance, recalcitrance and recovery. We will ask how this &quot;inheritance&quot; travels into Irish America, and even to this campus, asking what legacies are being lived out, and why, and what we make of that. The course will feature a diverse set of texts across a span of Irish literary tradition, including medieval and contemporary, fiction and memoir, poetry and prose, verbal, visual and musical media. On the way students will work on their speaking, analytical and writing skills. Course work will include short writing assignments and analytical papers, a presentation, and a creative assignment.
ENGL 20305	In this fine arts course we will read full-length books by young Latinx poets. We will discuss and learn from the them as we aspire to create our own literary art, in tandem with fun assignments, including but not limited to: writing to music, using a text from another language to write our own in English or Spanglish, visiting the Snite Museum on campus to use the visual or plastic arts as a springboard for our own literary art. We will also read and discuss essays on the craft of writing. The Latinx writers we will be reading will also be guests at special sessions on ZOOM, during which we'll be able to question them about their art. Students will experience at least one literary event to experience literature as performance. Finally, students will practice and hone a certain vocabulary in order to offer constructive feedback to one another. No prior experience with creative writing necessary. All levels and majors and colleges welcome.
ENGL 20340	“Have the courage to use your reason!” Immanuel Kant’s motto would have run into great difficulties in the age of artificial intelligence and ChatGPT. For early modern and Enlightenment writers, the cultivation of reason, individual freedom, and the pursuit of secular methods of inquiry were key frameworks through which to envision a future for human society. These ideals—and the literary, cultural movements through which they were propagated— have left a complex legacy that continues to be explored in modern literature and media. Enlightenment ideals are viewed now by scholars both as the harbingers of modernity and as implicated in the realities of slavery, colonialism, and empire. Now, when we confront our own uncertain future— in a moment of war, impending climate catastrophe, and sweeping technological changes— this class proposes an engagement with the futures of the past. We’ll collectively develop strategies to “read for the future,” paying attention to issues such as the scope and limits of “human” intelligence and the relationship between humans and the natural world. The class will especially foreground historically marginalized perspectives such as those of women and people of color; readings will include works by Margaret Cavendish, Mary Shelley, Olaudah Equiano, Joseph Conrad as well as texts such as sci-fi films and episodes from the TV-series Black Mirror.
ENGL 20396	In this course we will examine a range of works that have been read by children. These include works like fables, folk and fairy tales, which are meant for both adults and children, and works written primarily with a child audience in mind (though almost always with a &quot;dual address&quot; which simultaneously acknowledges the adult as a potential reader and purchaser of the work). Though often assumed to be simple, works written for children often demonstrate considerable complexity, both in terms of their plots, and in terms of the moral and ethical questions they raise. In addition to dealing with complex issues, children's literature is a key site for transmitting cultural and social values. By reading children's literature critically, we can learn much about ourselves, our society and our culture; but by reading children's literature from other places and other times we can also understand the cultural values, attitudes and behaviors of other cultures, which can in turn expose the limitations and benefits of our own structures of thinking.
ENGL 20440	This course introduces students to the Gothic short story. Areas of focus will include the history and development of the short story as prose fiction form, the print and publication market, and the many subgenres. The short story is a distinctive lens through which to view gothic literature's preoccupation with social, political, scientific, and moral issues. Students will also develop an understanding of the formal and thematic qualities of the gothic short story as a genre. Readings will include a variety of Anglophone authors.
ENGL 20591	Is it possible to think of the 21st century as a post-racial, post-feminist world? In her provocative 2012 study, Body as Evidence: Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender, Janell Hobson suggests that rather than having been eradicated, millennial hopes that the historical difficulties represented by race and gender have lost their significance in the present day are as far, if not even further away from the mark as they have ever been. For Hobson, policing the body, whether that be in terms of its race, its gender, or its sexuality, has remained paramount. &quot;[W]hile the early-twenty-first century discourse of 'postracial' and 'postfeminist' often declares the loss of meaning attached to race and gender,&quot; she argues, &quot;..the global scope of our media-reliant information culture insists on perpetuating raced and gendered meanings that support ideologies of dominance, privilege, and power.&quot; In Hobson's view, the body and how it is imagined rests at the center of such ideologies, pointing also to a number of crucial questions that become particularly important when considering the significance of race and gender through the lens of modernity. How might a reconsideration of race point also to a rethinking of gender and vice-versa? What does race actually mean? How does/can it alter the way we understand gender? Is it possible to think race beyond the idea of race? What might a new conception of race actually look like, and how might this influence our thinking on gender? How are the problems of race and gender intertwined, and how is/has the body been imagined in and through them? What can such questions tell us about today's racial and gendered realities, both inside and outside the university, both in the past and the present? This course takes a step backward to investigate these and other like questions in the context of the utopic impulse and its emphasis on the imagination in several 19th-century American authors whose work may be viewed as participating in a broad yet under-acknowledged vision of race, gender and Atlantic modernity that seeks to interrogate hierarchies of race and gender as these have been constructed and maintained within dominant ideologies. Grounding our analysis in a number of 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century political philosophical texts on law and utopia and drawing on insights from critical race theory, gender studies, feminist theory, theories of law and literature, and utopian studies, our goal will be to gain a more nuanced understanding of our racialized past and its troubled link to questions of gender both then and now, so that we may better hope to imagine - and reimagine - the shape of our collective democratic future in the 21st century's global community.
ENGL 20640	In this course, we will examine the role of labor in American literature from the decades before the Civil War to the late 20th century through the critical lens of Audre Lorde's theorization of the erotic. Through this theorization, Lorde identifies the intimate and varying relationships to power that are revealed when gender identity, race, sexuality, and class intersect with labor in U.S. American culture. We will critically examine what these classed, gendered, and raced aspects of labor reveal about American culture, ideology, identity, and future trajectories. We will interrogate, reflect, and deconstruct how writers affirm, challenge, and negotiate identity and conceptualize American society through representations of labor.
ENGL 20720	This literature course offers an opportunity to read, discuss, and write about a generous sampling of contemporary American poetry by living Latinx poets, utilizing as its principal text the anthology, The Wind Shifts: New Latino Poetry. There will also be a special module on Latinx poetry inspired by Latinx art, with particular attention to the Smithsonian American Art Museum's exhibit: &quot;Our America: the Latino Presence in American Art.&quot; We will also be relying significantly on a series of online resources, including video interviews with Latinx poets conducted here at Notre Dame. We will focus mainly on mid-career writers, discovering and examining some of the themes that characterize Latinx poetry. A number of the poets who we'll be reading will be special guests, via ZOOM, at various points during the semester: we'll get to ask them questions, and watch and hear them read some poems. We'll also encounter poems that challenge what one might expect when one hears the term, &quot;Latinx poetry.&quot;
ENGL 20780	US literature and popular music between the mid-19th century and the end of World War II. We will read key works of American prose (as well as some poetry) from the period's principal literary movements, including realism, naturalism, modernism, and multimedia documentary. We will also listen to musical works--Broadway tunes and blues songs, spirituals and symphonies. We'll pay particular attention to how segregation and other racial politics, changing roles for women, and the mass production of commodities influenced the art of this period. Texts will include writing by Stephen Crane, W.E.B. Du Bois, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Ernest Hemingway, Langston Hughes, Harriet Jacobs, and Edith Wharton, as well as music by George M. Cohan, George Gershwin, Scott Joplin, Paul Robeson, and Bessie Smith. Course requirements will include two essays, presentations, and active participation in online and in-class discussions.
ENGL 20791	Gazes are gravitational forces. They can erect and deconstruct identities, ideologies, and geography. This course investigates the ideological tensions that inform the gaze and how this gravitational force is experienced, produced, enforced, and reimagined by marginalized beings. It also reevaluates the gaze itself; we will examine the gaze within cinema, as a form of self-expression, institutional power, and a critical lens through which to question our looking practices. We will investigate how nationalism, race, gender, sexuality, ability, and class produce gazes while examining alternative gazes that envision an elsewhere. Context will guide our discussion as we consider how gazes are enforced within family, work, and political structures. Throughout the semester, students will research various interdisciplinary approaches to the gaze, consider their personal looking practices, and create a gaze of their own. This course takes an intersectional approach to the gaze; possible texts include La Llorona, Lilo &amp; Stitch, and poetry by Alan Pelaez Lopez and Larry Mitchell.
ENGL 20890	Lifelong Chicagoan Gwendolyn Brooks once said of her Bronzeville home, &quot;If you wanted a poem, you had only to look out of a window.&quot; This &quot;life in the raw&quot; that inspired the Pulitzer-winning poet also spoke to generations of writers and poets. What can the writing of Chicago, a place proud of its diversity but dogged by inequities, tell us about race and citizenship? And what does it mean to talk about the literature(s) of a city? We'll tackle these big questions as we learn about the 1893 World Fair; the Chicago Renaissance; the Black Arts Movement; the Latino Arts Movement; and Chicago's contemporary literary scene. Through discussion, several short writing assignments, and a longer, research essay, we'll sharpen our analytical and writing skills and seek to become lucid readers of Chicago's literary landscape.
ENGL 20891	The Black Panther movie franchise has intensified popular and scholarly interest in Black speculative fiction and Afrofuturism. To better understand the significance of this phenomenon, we will trace the literary traditions that made these films possible. We will start with genre-bending works by W.E.B. Du Bois, Toni Morrison, Ralph Ellison, Samuel Delany, Octavia Butler, and Ishmael Reed among other African American authors. Before we end the semester by watching both Black Panther films, we will also discuss other multimedia texts that challenge normative scifi narratives. By the end of the semester, students will have a better understanding of how Black speculative writing has indeed shaped science fiction as we know it today. Students from all majors are welcome. 
ENGL 20920	“What if we stun existence one more time?” writes Ayisha Siddiqa, Pakistani poet and water justice activist. As oceans heat and acidify, floods wipe out coastal populations, and polluted rivers poison communities, what will it take to literally transform the global relationships—colonial, raced, gendered, and classed—that have wreaked such destruction? Throughout this course, we will investigate how poems contain and spill ways of imagining these relationships. As we dive into the geopolitical, mythic, and ritual histories of the contemporary water crisis, we’ll examine how poems compose water, and how water composes poems–that is, how metaphors and media create and flood one another. We’ll begin the course with poems, news reports, podcasts of contemporary indigenous “water protectors,” and jump back to the primordial waters of various creation myths and flood narratives. From there, we’ll trace the emergence of global oceanic networks in the Early Modern period in courtly sonnets and Middle Passage testimonies. Animal migrations, human eroticism, and interreligious forms of prayer collect in verse at the end of the course. Assignments will include a writing journal, a podcast or experimental sound project, and a final paper.
ENGL 30007	Self-Writing  Foucault describes self-writing as writing that “transforms the things seen or heard into tissue and blood.” Our own self-writing practice will begin with a close reading of Augustine’s Confessions, which will be our guide as we build a reflective journaling practice rooted in both our everyday experiences and meditation on reading. Drawing on the material from these journals, we will then have the opportunity to workshop longer pieces in autobiographical, memoiristic, epistolary, and autofictional forms. Readings from Gertrude Stein, Clarice Lispector, Georges Perec, Fernando Pessoa, Kathy Acker, and Virginie Despientes will help us in these experiments. While the writing in this course will predominantly take the form of creative nonfiction, writers of all disciplines should enjoy the opportunity to play with authorial voice.
ENGL 30101	This course provides beginning English majors with experience in the analysis, interpretation, and appreciation of literary works of different kinds and eras. Texts assigned will vary from one section to another, but all sections will include significant attention to poetry, as well as treatment of at least one other genre (fiction, drama, non-fiction prose). Frequent writing about works studied will introduce students to the practice of critical argument and consideration of how to read criticism as well as literature critically.    
ENGL 30111	In this course we will read a rich variety of British literature from the end of the 17th century to the present – a sweeping period that includes some extraordinarily dynamic phases of literary and cultural history. During these centuries, phenomena that are now so familiar to us – individualism, consumerism, industrialism, mass publishing, and social debates about gender, class, childhood, and education – were being defined and gaining increasing influence in English society. These developments, together with such major historical events as the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, World War I, and World War II, helped to define key aspects of what we now think of as “modern” life. Our course will examine the many ways that British literature of this period reflects these historical and cultural conditions. We will read a variety of poetry and prose genres, taking in a span of authors running from the first Poet Laureate of England (John Dryden) to the current one (Simon Armitage), and including, among others, Jonathan Swift, William Blake, Jane Austen, William Wordsworth, Mary Shelley, Emily Bronte, Charles Dickens, T.S. Eliot, Katherine Mansfield, Zadie Smith, and Kazuo Ishiguro.
ENGL 30116	In this course, we will study landmark literary works published in the United States from 1865 to the present. You can think of this class as a survey in “American literature,” but as we explore the different movements and diverse traditions sometimes collected under that name, we’ll discover writers probing themes of identity and social belonging in ways that challenge and reimagine the idea of “Americanness&quot; itself. As a community of close readers, we’ll consider how the habits of thought and feeling enacted in novels, short stories, poems, and essays can lead us to remake our sense of the past, and stake claims for collective futures. Throughout the course, we’ll also keep front and center the historical contexts that give rise to literary achievements, from the massive population shifts that stirred up literary renaissances in Harlem and Chicago, to the liberation movements of the 1960s that set the tempo for contemporaneous revolutions in literary style. We'll conclude the semester by making some expert judgments about what's happening today in U.S. literature, and some informed predictions about its future. Our authors may include Henry James, Edith Wharton, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Robert Frost, Marianne Moore, Claude McKay, William Faulkner, Elizabeth Bishop, Gwendolyn Brooks, Flannery O’Connor, James Baldwin, Rudolfo Anaya, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Toni Morrison.
ENGL 30182	In this course, we will challenge the single story/ies U.S. schools and curricula have told about books, characters, and cultural groups by focusing on literature by and about people from various populations that have been traditionally underrepresented in the United States. We will discuss young adult literature from parallel cultures (including possible works by and about African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino/as, Native Americans, Middle Eastern Americans, and other ethnic groups), as well as literature by and about populations traditionally defined by class, religion, ability, gender and sexuality. Course participants will investigate theoretical perspectives, issues, controversies, and educational implications for these texts, including race and racism, whiteness and privilege (in society and in the educational system), and critical literacy. As an extension of the course, we will also examine the young adult literature market and how contemporary media may reinforce or resist the stereotypes, labels, and single stories associated with these cultures. Possible texts include All American Boys, American Born Chinese (graphic novel), a Jacqueline Woodson novel, Openly Straight, a canonical text like To Kill a Mockingbird, Every Day, and several choice options, including a Classic/Newberry text, one text representing a non-abled bodied protagonist, and one contemporary text.
ENGL 30218	This course will examine Irish poetry, written both in Irish and English, through the prism of protest. It will explore the public role occupied by the poet in Ireland and the concurrent anxieties and responsibilities felt by the poets who have occupied that role. The course will examine the formal prosodic dimensions of the poems and students will also learn about the historical circumstances in which the poems were produced. The course will include the work of WB Yeats, Seán Ó Ríordáin, Seamus Heaney, Máire Mhac an tSaoi, Eavan  Boland, Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill, Paula Meehan, Liam Ó Muirthile, Michael O’Loughlin, Aifric MacAodha and Thomas McCarthy.
ENGL 30851	In this course, students will read and model their poems upon writers who, by virtue of their talent and craft, have left their mark in English and American poetic traditions.  We will also examine performative aspects of poetry by attending a variety of readings either on or off campus.  Students will circulate their own poems among all the participants, who will then discuss and critique them in a workshop setting.  Throughout the semester attention will be given to those proven strategies for composing and revising one’s poetry.  Assignments will be fashioned so as to provide practice both in traditional forms and in free verse.
ENGL 30857	Hogwarts, Middle Earth, Westeros, Panem: every story starts somewhere. How do you build a compelling world that's not just backdrop, but part of the story? In this reading-intensive fiction workshop, you'll learn to create vivid and dynamic worlds, embed those worlds in your characters' thoughts, and bring those worlds to life through your characters' actions. While focusing primarily on fantastic, speculative, and weird fiction, this workshop will help you develop the skills you need to make any world breathe on the page - even this one. Readings will include work from William Blake, Kelly Link, George R.R. Martin, Nnedi Okorafor, Laurie Penny, J.K. Rowling, and Jeff VanderMeer.
ENGL 30858	In this course, we'll investigate the piercing and propulsive properties of short texts. While many of the texts we'll read are by poets, we'll encounter a range of genres including essays, short stories, captions, letters, annotations, fragments, and epigrams. In addition to trying out hands at a variety of short forms, we'll also examine how writers assemble short texts into sequences and longer works, ultimately using these methods to conceive of and configure final projects of our own. Coursework will include in- and out-of-class writing, collaborations, workshops, presentations, and a final project.
ENGL 40130	Asian theatre- and film-makers have produced some of the most innovative and exciting versions of Shakespeare's work. His strong presence in Asia also speaks to the histories and legacies of colonization and cultural imperialism. This course explores several well-known Shakespearean plays through the lens of Asian adaptation, rooted in both close reading of the plays themselves and the historical-cultural contexts of their adaptations. How, when, and why have specific Shakespearean plays captured the imaginations of Asian theatre artists and filmmakers? How have they transformed Shakepearean texts through translation, the use of local performance forms, new geographic and historical settings, and other techniques? How do these reimaginings rethink what &quot;Shakespeare&quot; might mean? By exploring such questions, students will gain a deeper understanding of Shakespeare, Asian theatre, and the complexities of their conjoining.
ENGL 40196	This course offers a multidisciplinary introduction to the vast variety of theoretical approaches used to understand media and technologies. From film, TV, and videogames to computers, internet, and social media, we will study different methods and concepts that help us understand our mediated condition(s) better. Moving historically and geographically, we will also encounter the many ways in which the term 'media' itself gets deployed and critiqued in scholarship across humanistic and social scientific disciplines. We will plug some of these (critical) theoretical understandings of media and culture into the longer histories of politics, philosophy, language, and literature, considering, for example, books as media technologies. And finally, we will ask what studies of media and mediation can do for our comprehension of the politico-economic, sociocultural, racial, and environmental crises surrounding us today.
ENGL 40202	Why did the Middle Ages produce so many legends, so many stories about gods, heroes, and fantastic events? What do the origins of these stories tell us about medieval European culture and the way it used both writing and the fantastic? What do the differences between different versions of the same story reveal about the stories' audience and composition? Why do some of these stories still resonate powerfully today? These are the kinds of questions we will ask as we survey a range of medieval works representing a variety of literary traditions, including Anglo-Saxon (Beowulf), Norse (the Poetic Edda and Hrolf Kraki's Saga), French (the Song of Roland), Italian (the Inferno), Welsh (the Mabinogion), and Finnish (Kalevala).
ENGL 40224	The Pastoral has been one of the longest-lasting and frequently most prestigious genres (or modes) of poetry in English-language traditions. This course explores how and why poetry that extols the virtues of rural life became so pervasive; how it adapted in the face of changing social, economic, and environmental contexts over more than a thousand years; what problems Pastoral poetry addresses and what problems it causes; how modern and postmodern poets have responded to the Pastoral tradition in a decidedly post-pastoral age; last but not least, what work Pastoral poetry can still do for readers today, and where this genre (or mode) can still do important cultural work.  In the first half of the course, we will read broadly across the long history of Pastoral poetry, with texts from the classical period, the Middle Ages, and the early modern period. The second half of the semester will be spent interrogating the changes that have occurred in the Pastoral genre (or mode) since the Industrial Revolution. An important part of the course will be looking at recent and contemporary engagements with the genre (or mode) in which poets critique or react against its conventions in the pursuit of newer and truer forms of ecopoetry. The critical framework for the course will be provided by ecocriticism--the relatively new critical approach that believes it is possible and useful to read literary texts from an environmental perspective.
ENGL 40259	In the wake of the Reformation-era's massive upheavals came the greatest flowering of devotional poetry in the English language. This body of literature offers its readers the opportunity to explore questions pertaining broadly to the study of lyric and to the study of the relationships between religion and literature. Early modern devotional poetry oscillates between eros and agape, private and communal modes of expression, shame and pride, doubt and faith, evanescence and transcendence, mutability and permanence, success and failure, and agency and helpless passivity.  It experiments with gender, language, form, meter, voice, song, and address.  We'll follow devotional poets through their many oscillations and turns by combining careful close reading of the poetry with the study of relevant historical, aesthetic, and theological contexts. You'll learn to read lyric poetry skillfully and sensitively, to think carefully about relationships between lyric and religion, and to write incisively and persuasively about lyric.  Authors we'll read may include Thomas Brampton, Richard Maidstone, Francesco Petrarca (in translation), Sir Thomas Wyatt, Anne Locke, Mary Sidney, Sir Philip Sidney, St. Robert Southwell, S.J., Henry Constable, Fulke Greville, Edmund Spenser, John Donne, George Herbert, Robert Herrick, Henry Vaughan, Richard Crashaw, John Milton, and the great hymn writer Isaac Watts.
ENGL 40264	Medieval literature abounds with tales of travel. Celtic, Norse, and British authors created an exciting array of narratives about journeys through far-flung, fantastical, and holy places, and transformative encounters with new people, landscapes, and ideas. While these stories often depict the distant and unfamiliar, they also reveal that which is &quot;close to home,&quot; shedding new light on the identities and beliefs of travelers and audience members alike. In this course we will explore the genre of travel literature through a variety of texts, both sacred and secular (adventure and voyage tales, pilgrimage accounts, sagas, hagiographies, etc.). In our conversations, papers, and, if students choose, creative work, we will analyze the ideas, motifs, and compositional goals that animate these works and examine the implications that they hold, with respect to both the cultures from which they originate, and ourselves as contemporary readers (or vicarious journeyers). We will read both a range of primary literary texts and recent critical essays. Primary texts include the Voyage of St. Brendan, the Welsh Mabinogi, the Vinland Sagas, the Book of Margery Kempe, and the Travels of Sir John Mandeville (all available in modern English, some excerpted). Students will be asked to write two papers (or one paper and one creative project with analytical reflection), take a written exam, and give a presentation, as well as to participate regularly in class discussions.
ENGL 40304	In this course we will read all of Austen's novels, supplemented by helpful contemporary texts, and critical commentary on the works. We will attend to Austen's style (her elegance, her irony, her rudeness); her aesthetic principles; her political and social engagements, (her views on slavery and Empire, the &quot;revolution in female manners&quot; advocated by Mary Wollstonecraft, her critique of masculinity); the function of the marriage plot; and the relationship between the novel and the theatre. Students will gain an appreciation for the complexity of the work of one of the greatest novelists in the English language. They will also consider how these works respond to the historical moment in which they were written, and how and why these works resonate across time.
ENGL 40326	This course examines British literature of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in the context of the period's major social, political, and cultural revolutions. Questions of literature and social justice will be at the forefront of our readings and discussions. We will focus on how writers engaged creatively and rhetorically with topics including the rights of men and women; the legitimacy of revolution; the abolition of slavery; the experiences of poverty and war; the nature of heroism; the powers of the imagination; the potentials of science; and the social role of the writer. We will read selections from a wide range of writers in diverse genres, including Mary Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, William Blake, Edmund Burke, Olaudah Equiano, William Godwin, William Wordsworth, Lord Byron, and Percy Shelley. Instances of contemporary visual art and, where possible, theater and/or film, will help broaden our understanding of this intensely creative and conflictual period in British literary history.
ENGL 40350	This double-author course showcases what most readers would see as an &quot;odd couple&quot; among Victorian authors. Charles Dickens (1812-70) was the Shakespeare of his time, a prolific creator of memorable characters and incidents, at once comic and tragic. But post-Victorian critics often see him as a prime exponent of Victorian earnestness, sentimentality and even hypocrisy. And Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) was, well, the Wilde of Victorian Britain: he was so dazzling that even those who wished to hate him often had to give up and laugh with him. But his life took a classically tragic form after his public humiliation and imprisonment for homosexual offenses. Our principal texts by Dickens will probably be Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, and Our Mutual Friend. Our readings in Wilde will cover the gamut of his efforts but emphasize his society comedies and his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. Graded coursework includes three papers and a final exam, along with reading quizzes and participation.
ENGL 40529	In this course, we will examine the relationship between national and sexual politics through our study of gender and twentieth-century Irish drama. Beginning with the first controversies surrounding the representation of women on the Irish stage at the beginning of the twentieth century, we will study representations of gender and sexuality in the major canonical figures of the Irish renaissance--W. B. Yeats, J. M. Synge, Sean O'Casey--while investigating lesser-known female and queer Irish playwrights from that time such as Lady Augusta Gregory, Lennox Robinson, and Teresa Deevy. We will also look at how the treatment of gender and sexuality changes in the work of postwar and contemporary Irish playwrights, including Samuel Beckett, Brendan Behan, Brian Friel, Anne Devlin, Frank McGuinness, and Marina Carr. Along with the plays we will study their historical and cultural context and the sometimes quite vehement responses that these plays evoked in their audiences. Students will write three papers and do one in-class presentation.
ENGL 40556	This course will explore novels and short fiction (mainly British) written between 1880 and the middle of the 20th century, a period organized by dramatic shifts in cultural understandings of gender and sexuality. Experimental, middlebrow, and popular novels attempted to represent the modern through depictions of new sorts of subjects: New Women, suffragettes, flappers, sapphists, typists, war workers, and more. Attention to these figures will give us an opportunity to notice how modern fiction engaged the texture of modern life through representations of free love and divorce; of reproduction, birth control, and abortion; queer sexuality; domestic and paid labor; and more. 
ENGL 40590	Is it possible to think of the 21st century as a post-racial, post-feminist world?  In her provocative 2012 study, Body as Evidence:  Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender, Janell Hobson suggests that rather than having been eradicated, millennial hopes that the historical difficulties represented by race and gender have lost their significance in the present day are as far, if not even further away from the mark as they have ever been.  For Hobson, policing the body, whether that be in terms of its race, its gender, or its sexuality, has remained paramount.   &quot;[W]hile the early-twenty-first century discourse of 'postracial' and 'postfeminist' often declares the loss of meaning attached to race and gender,&quot; she argues, &quot;..the global scope of our media-reliant information culture insists on perpetuating raced and gendered meanings that support ideologies of dominance, privilege, and power.&quot;  In Hobson's view, the body and how it is imagined rests at the center of such ideologies, pointing also to a number of crucial questions that become particularly important when considering the significance of race and gender through the lens of modernity.  How might a reconsideration of race point also to a rethinking of gender and vice-versa?  What does race actually mean?  How does/can it alter the way we understand gender?  Is it possible to think race beyond the idea of race? What might a new conception of race actually look like, and how might this influence our thinking on gender?   How are the problems of race and gender intertwined, and how is/has the body been imagined in and through them? What can such questions tell us about today's racial and gendered realities, both inside and outside the university, both in the past and the present?  This course takes a step backward to investigate these and other like questions in the context of the utopic impulse and its emphasis on the imagination in several 19th-century American authors whose work may be viewed as participating in a broad yet under-acknowledged vision of race, gender and Atlantic modernity that seeks to interrogate hierarchies of race and gender as these have been constructed and maintained within dominant ideologies.  Grounding our analysis in a number of 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century political philosophical texts on law and utopia and drawing on insights from critical race theory, gender studies, feminist theory, theories of law and literature, and utopian studies, our goal will be to gain a more nuanced understanding of our racialized past and its troubled link to questions of gender both then and now, so that we may better hope to imagine - and reimagine - the shape of our collective democratic future in the 21st century's global community.

ENGL 40621	Wherever we place it in the pantheon of great plays  and in spite of Tolstoy's loathing of it, King Lear is a very extraordinary play. This course will explore its extraordinariness by concentrating on it unremittingly. It will do so in two steps. For the first half of the semester we will slow-read the play together, thinking about anything and, insofar as we can, everything that it provokes us to investigate, from Shakespeare's sources to early stagings and revisions, from its views on power, gender and the spiritual to its verse and vocabulary, and so on and on. In the second half of the semester we will engage with the play in performance and reimaginings through film versions and a variety of adaptations from Nahum Tate to Jane Smiley and beyond.
ENGL 40750	Generative AI is a form of computing in which computer systems generate media such as text, images, sound, video, or combinations based on prompts or other information provided to the computer.  These systems, including, but are not limited to, ChatGPT, Midjourney &amp; DALLE, have been evolving rapidly and have led to extreme excitement, confusion, and fear.  This course provides a survey of how to understand and use a number of these tools including explorations in prompt engineering as well as addressing issues from across the liberal arts including artistic, economic, social/psychological, educational and legal concerns and opportunities. 
ENGL 40759	In this course, we will deploy critical and creative modes of inquiry as we undertake a survey of mid- to late twentieth-century American poetry arising from New York City, which in the postwar period became a nexus of literary and artistic experimentation. It is within this geographic and historical framework that the New York School of Poets coalesced around the core figures of Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, Barbara Guest, and James Schuyler. Focusing on this dynamic array of poets as well as their precursors (e.g., Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein, Federico García Lorca), fellow travelers (e.g., Allen Ginsberg, Amiri Baraka, Frank Lima), and subsequent &quot;generations&quot; of New York poets (e.g., Joe Brainard, Bernadette Mayer, John Yau), we will consider how lines of affinity and intimacy as well as the cultural reverberations of the city drew together writers so diverse in outlook and method that Ashbery remarked, &quot;our program is the absence of any program.&quot; In this light, to figure out what it means to be part of the this anti-programmatic community, we will explore how the New York School intersected with the Beats, the Black Arts Movement, the Boston and San Francisco Renaissances, the Nuyorican Movement, and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Poetry—prompting us to consider how the concept of an avant-garde becomes, in this period, a ramifying network of friends, lovers, and intellectual rivals engaged in aesthetic cross-pollination. Our undertaking will be attentive to the intermedial dialogue between these poets and New York painters (e.g., Willem de Kooning, Fairfield Porter, Jane Freilicher), methods of collaboration, the influence of postmodern theory, and how race, gender, sexuality, and place shaped what has been cited as one of the most enduringly influential bodies of literature in the postwar world. Assignments will engage students' critical and creative talents.  
ENGL 40814	Native Americans have long been trapped in a betwixt and between state, caught by the forces of past and present, tradition and assimilation, romanticization and caricature. Yet through it all, Native voices have continued to speak of the Indian experience with great power and eloquence. This course will introduce Native American literature as a distinctive contribution to American and world literature. We will examine a wide range of expressive culture from the last century, including novels, poetry, graphic stories, children's literature, film, digital media, autobiographies, performances of oral literature, and music. Through the passion, creativity, and humor of Indian authors, we will learn something of the historical experience of Native men and women, and how they have reacted to massacres and mascots, racism and reservations, poverty and political oppression. Above all, we will try to understand how indigenous authors have used literature to engage crucial issues of race and culture in the United States that continue to influence their lives: identity, self-discovery, the centrality of place, cultural survival, and the healing power of language and spirituality. Class discussions will incorporate literary, historical, and ethnographic perspectives of Native expressive culture and the agency of authors as artists and activists vis-à-vis the wider American literary tradition. Authors include Sherman Alexie, Nicholas Black Elk, Louise Erdrich, D'Arcy McNickle, N. Scott Momaday, Linda Hogan, Winona LaDuke, and Leonard Peltier.
ENGL 40850	Advanced Fiction Writing is an advanced workshop for students with a serious commitment to writing fiction. This course will look to examine contemporary conversations regarding race, diaspora, trauma, and ecological disaster, for us to - as Chris Abani notes - redress the art of an existential wound. We will read a range of contemporary authors, either story collections or novels. Discussions will also include contemporary publishing practices, placing work in literary journals, and pursuing writing beyond undergraduate study i.e., graduate programs. By reading as practitioners of the art of fiction, students will engage in productive critiques via antiracist workshop practices and lead class discussion framing. The emphasis will be the individualized reading of student work with the goal to refine their authorial &quot;voice.&quot; 
ENGL 40851	This class is for writers who have tried their hands at writing poetry and would like to push themselves further. We will read and write broadly, immersing ourselves in contemporary poetry and its traditional antecedents, as well as combing fiction, plays, visual art, film, music, and other media to find forms and techniques to try out in our poetry. We will draft, revise, improvise, workshop, critique and perform with and for each other, and we will also think about the means and media by which poetry is published. With our minds on the currents shaping, for good or ill, the world we live in, will deeply consider the possibility that poetry might change, enhance, redefine and ornament the world—and make new worlds.
ENGL 40852	This course is intended for students who have already taken Advanced Fiction Writing and who are seriously interested in writing fiction.  Advanced Fiction Writing is an advanced workshop for students with a serious commitment to writing fiction. This course will look to examine contemporary conversations regarding race, diaspora, trauma, and ecological disaster, for us to - as Chris Abani notes - redress the art of an existential wound.

ENGL 40863	While taking a hemispheric approach to black writing, this course will examine the creation of the black first person through autobiography. Taking up classic texts from across the Americas and the Caribbean, such as Biography of a Runaway Slave, Child of the Dark, The Narrative of the Life of Fredrick Douglass, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, and Black Boy, we will explore the multiple ways in which black writers create the black rhetorical self. Why is the black &quot;I&quot; ubiquitous across African American writing of the hemisphere, and what are its implications in relation to race, gender, class, and community? What does it mean for a black narrator to announce her or himself as author or speaking subject? What does it mean to speak or write oneself into the public's consciousness, and why does it matter? What are the constitutive elements of a black rhetorical self, and how might they differ from other racial/ethnic identities?
ENGL 40962	The novel might have always been global, emerging as it has alongside the massively expanding circulation of people, ideas, and commodities that characterise the past five hundred years of world history. But the past century has seen the rise of novels that are self-conscious about their global-ness, even as political and intellectual currents have tended towards focusing on the regional, linguistic, national, and other particularities of cultural production. This class will consider a range of modern and contemporary novels, critics, and theorists from around the globe and through them consider the relationships between specificity, particularity, generality, and universality in global literature. This will serve as an introduction to topics in transnational, postcolonial, world-literary, and global anglophone literary studies, and as an occasion to deepen those debates.
ENGL 46999	A directed reading is the equivalent of a regular English course in terms of assigned reading and writing. The student and faculty advisor determine the reading list and writing assignments. It may not duplicate an existing course. Students must complete the required forms in order to receive permission to take the course.

ENGL 60224	Medieval sources preserve amazing stories about journeys to far-flung and fantastical places told from the perspectives of women and men, migrants, pilgrims, colonizers and indigenous peoples. Accounts of Jerusalem, Purgatory, the pagan Otherworld, Ireland and even the Americas, highlight transformative encounters with new peoples, landscapes, and ideas. These stories also illuminate familiar anxieties and beliefs about place and identity, what it means to cross borders, to be exiled from home, and how that can change us, for better and for worse. We consider Celtic, Norse and British sources (voyage tales, Otherworld quests, pilgrimage guides, world maps) as well as contemporary works (Anzaldúa’s La Frontera/Borderlands) and speculative reinventions (an Inuit YA fantasy account of Vikings in America, films like The Green Knight and Howl's Moving Castle). Requirements include an exam, multiple writing exercises (creative writing an option), oral presentations, and 1-2 longer papers. No previous experience is necessary and all are welcome!
ENGL 90005	The course is an intensive survey of Latin scripts from antiquity through the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Students will be able to accurately read and transcribe Latin scripts, expand systems of abbreviation, identify, date, and localize (when possible) different hands, and defend their interpretations. There will be a strong emphasis on the different varieties of Gothic script (textualis, cursiva, hybrida, etc.). Once the class reaches the twelfth century, students will work extensively with Notre Dame's medieval collection of 288 manuscripts and fragments. Aspects of practical applications and textual criticism will be addressed at the end of the course. All meetings will be held in the Special Collections Seminar Room.
ENGL 90013	A fiction workshop for graduate students in the MFA in Creative Writing program, with an emphais on students developing their own aesthetic and personal vision, juxtaposed to and within the larger movement of the contemporary literary world.
ENGL 90038	English 90038 is designed for the graduate student enrolled in Notre Dame’s MFA program. The principal aim of the course is for each student to generate poetry of publishable quality by the end of the semester, and for the student in the second year of the program to complete the MFA thesis. Reading assignments are aimed to encourage and to sustain ongoing discussions on craft and poetics. The operative words here are diversity and plurality. We will also consider the current landscape of poetry publishing, especially that of first books.    
ENGL 90041	Perhaps the most famous definition of poetry in American literature is Robert Frost's quip that poetry is that which is &quot;lost in translation.&quot; Translation, it appears, is both central and marginal in the way we think about literature in this country. Through translation seemingly stable texts and notions of authorship become volatile. That is in large part why translation has at times been a source of anxiety in American literature, and at times a source of inspiration. In this class we will explore this volatile zone of translation by translating literary texts (prose, poetry, drama etc), reading theoretical texts, and by bringing our experiences as writers and readers, artists and scholars to the topic. Although it would be helpful, fluency in a foreign language is not required. Translation Studies is in the middle of an exciting moment - conventional ways of viewing translation are being questioned and US literature is becoming increasingly interested in foreign literatures -  and this class will participate in this moment.
ENGL 90155	 In this course, we will examine the intersections of migration with LGBTQ* identities. We will begin with James Baldwin's Another Country (1961) and explore the ways that migration and movement (in multiple senses), as seemingly fundamental aspects of queer identity, further intersect with race, ethnicity, and gender. Throughout the course, we will be asking - and responding to - several questions, such as: How is the idea of home, as space and place, explored by LGBTQ* writers?  Is migration a necessary paradigm for thinking of and through the LGBTQ* community?  How have cities been shaped by queer identities?  How is migration expressed through textual form in LGBTQ* texts?  How do race and ethnicity intersect with gender and sexuality?  There are many more questions that will be raised, and these five are just some of the first that we will think through. This is an interdisciplinary course with a bit of an international focus. Because this course works through a range of film and literature, we will be discussing various formal strategies and methods used by each medium, and how these textual qualities map onto and explore content. We will be concerned with &quot;movement&quot; as a paradigm, and as such, will examine how movement is conveyed in film and literature, especially in regards to LGBTQ* identities.
ENGL 90190	The field of literary studies has recently seen a return of interest in the aesthetic, traditionally defined as the realm of beauty detached from the concerns of everyday life, but now coming into focus as a mode of experience that develops individual and collective capacities, including for social and political critique. Representative titles include Joseph North's Literary Criticism: A Concise Political History (2017), Derek Attridge's The Work of Literature (2015), Caroline Levine's Forms: Whole, Rhythm, Hierarchy, Network (2015), Fred Moten's In the Break: The Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition (2003), and Deepika Bahri's Native Intelligence: Aesthetics, Politics, and Postcolonial Literature (2003). This seminar examines such returns to the aesthetic in theory and criticism while also addressing the returns (or gains) of the aesthetic for literary study today. Readings and discussion will be divided into four main units: a first on foundational treatments of aesthetics in late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literary theory and philosophy; a second on the adaptation of such theories in the early twentieth century, notably as part of the methodology of close reading that came to define academic literary studies in the United States and Britain; a third on the uptake and critique of aesthetically oriented methodologies in the mid- to late twentieth century; and a fourth on the past several decades' attempts to revive and redefine aesthetic concerns and criticism. Students will be invited to engage critically with the seminar material while reflecting on its returns for their own work.
ENGL 90250	In this course, we will read bestiaries, fables, beast epics, and other pieces of literature that focus on animals. We will read works originally composed in English, Arabic, Latin, French, and Spanish (Catalan), although all will be read in English. Included among them are fables attributed to Aesop, the Physiologus, Kalīla wa-Dimna, Marie de France’s fables and lais, Richard of Fournival’s bestiary, Chaucer’s Nun’s Priest’s Tale and Parliament of Fowls, the Owl and the Nightingale, Ramon Llull’s Book of Beasts, The Case of the Animals versus Man, and Peter Alfonsus’s Disciplina clericalis. We will also read a good deal of scholarship from the field of animal studies and elsewhere. We will discuss the ways in which animals are represented, their relationship with humans, their relationship to nature, the ethical questions they raise, their classification, the transmission of various stories, and their appeal.
ENGL 90270	The seventeenth century in Old and New England saw an exciting and unprecedented flourishing of writing by women. This course looks at a rich and diverse range of women's writing, primarily from the second half of the century. Genres to be read and discussed include autobiography, letters, recipe books, poetry, fictional and non-fictional prose, and private and public drama. Authors include such now well-known figures as Aemilia Lanyer, Lady Mary Wroth, Margaret Cavendish, Anne Bradstreet, Mary Rowlandson, and Aphra Behn. Primary texts will be read and discussed in biographical and historical context, alongside literary scholarship setting out current critical interests and debates. Among the questions to be addressed: How do women fashion themselves in and through their writing? How do gender concerns intersect with class, religion, politics, and race?  How do early women writers use and boldly revise different literary forms?
ENGL 90692	This graduate course will consider four or five newer approaches to the history of American literature. The approaches covered will include selections from the following list of topics, in consultation with the students enrolled in the class: war and peace; varieties of religious expression; media and mediation; nature, science, and technology; colonization and immigration; and captivities (from the colonial period and slavery through prison literature). There will be a mix of prose and poetry in each unit, and each unit will span the early and later periods. Most readings will be drawn from the Norton Anthology of American Literature, Shorter Tenth Edition, Volumes A and B. Assignments for the class will include a syllabus and course design; class presentation(s); and either one 20-25 page paper or two 10-12 page papers.
ENGL 90750	Generative AI is a form of computing in which computer systems generate media such as text, images, sound, video, or combinations based on prompts or other information provided to the computer. These systems, including, but are not limited to, ChatGPT, Midjourney &amp; DALLE, have been evolving rapidly and have led to extreme excitement, confusion, and fear. This course provides a survey of how to understand and use a number of these tools including explorations in prompt engineering as well as addressing issues from across the liberal arts including artistic, economic, social/psychological, educational and legal concerns and opportunities. 
ENGL 90798	Catastrophic global climate change presents intractable challenges to global politics, inherited notions of human progress and possibility, privileged Enlightenment understandings of freedom and liberation, and the very idea of literary narrative as it has emerged in imperial fossil fuel culture. This  seminar will explore the predicament of the postcolonial anthropocene through scientific, historical, theoretical, and literary approaches, with special attention to the relationship between literacy and extractive capitalism. Readings may include work by David Abram, Aime Cesaire, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Silvia Frederici, Amitav Ghosh, Hans Jonas, Achille Mbembe, Carolyn Merchant, Peter Sloterdijk, and Sylvia Wynter.
ENGL 90981	This course takes its title from an anthology of poetry published at the millennium which gathered together writers from Britain and Ireland—many with origins elsewhere, from the Caribbean to South Asia—under the flexible rubric of being “other,” and engaged in avant-garde, oppositional poetics. The project has been echoed in poetics theory that throws its nets far wider, such as Jacob Edmond’s impressive book A Common Strangeness (2012), which reads across to Russia and China, too, from his native New Zealand, to “show how the poetics of strangeness—just as much as history, geopolitics, and economics—have shaped conceptions of the 'global.'&quot; This course will consider such arguments and the accomplishments of such theoretical projects as it reads the work of Anglophone avant-garde communities and individual poets ranging from North America and the “Black Atlantic” to Europe and South Asia. Further stops may be planned depending on the interests of seminar members, and a final segment may include current work issuing from Ukraine. Requirements will involve consistent participation in discussion, partial planning and leading of seminar sessions, and a final, proto-publishable work whose goals and aspirational destination will be tailored to individual students and the degrees that they are pursuing.
ENGL 92001	The aim of English 92001 is to prepare you to teach Writing and Rhetoric (WR) in the University Writing Program at Notre Dame. The course does this in two ways: first, by introducing you to readings in rhetoric and composition that provide a basis for making informed choices in the classroom. Second, by providing you with opportunities to practice skills such as lesson planning, designing writing assignments, responding to student papers, managing writing groups, and planning a syllabus. To these ends, you will read selectively in rhetoric and composition theory, observe faculty currently teaching in the University Writing Program, and complete a series of short assignments. By the end of the course, you will be prepared to teach Writing and Rhetoric at the college level.

ESS 30596	In 1975, the African-American writer Ishmael Reed put culture at the center of politics: “If I have you revering my art, behaving like me and adopting my psychology, then I’ve got you. If I’ve got your head, I’ve got you.” Confronted with the whiteness of U.S. publishing and school curricula, Reed and his peers saw literature as a key front in this broader struggle over the making and unmaking of American identity. Yet the question of literature’s contribution to the struggle elicited stark disagreement. Would it counter racial stereotype with accurate representation or refuse the burden of racial representativeness? Would it lay claim to the American nation on behalf of the racially minoritized, or throw in with different political horizons? Would it address the white reader unfamiliar with the realities of racial oppression, or the non-white reader seeking a different relation to histories already lived? These disagreements would only intensify in the following decades as the call for multicultural representation became increasingly institutionalized – with syllabi and publishing undergoing modest diversification, and universities framing racial difference as a strategic asset.    Moving from the late 20th century to the present, our course attends to how these political ambitions and desires informed the writing, publishing, and teaching of American literature by writers of color. It asks how these authors not only engaged in activism by literary means, but also reckoned with the artistic and political dilemmas that attended this doubled pursuit. To this end, the bulk of our readings will draw from literary fiction, non-fiction, and poetry, including authors like Gloria Anzaldua, Paul Beatty, Maxine Hong Kingston, Viet Thanh Nguyen, and Wendy Trevino.
ESS 30600	ESS 30600 will provide an overview of the array of research methods used in educational settings. Topics covered include formulating research questions, data collection methodologies (survey methods, experimental design, observational methods, and interviews), analyzing the collected data, and interpreting results in context. Students will read and discuss different approaches to educational research, examine educational research, and engage in research activities. At the end of the course, students should be able to 1) critically review education research, 2) recognize the appropriate research method to address their question of interest, and 3) further study and engage in educational research.
ESS 30646	What is a mathematical idea you learned in school? How did you share what you learned? The purpose of this course is to examine children as individuals who construct understanding of the world around them through the study of mathematics. This course focuses on how adults working with children can mediate this process through learning opportunities, eliciting thinking, and providing support to encourage further understanding. In addition, we will reflect on how, as adults, we may misinterpret student understandings and either over- or underestimate what students’ knowledge and skill, which may impact future educational opportunities. Using this lens, we will consider the goals of mathematics education, current debates, and evidence for how children develop mathematical understanding using research articles and commentaries to guide our discussions and analysis. As a component of this course, we will interview children at an off-site facility during class hours to learn about their knowledge and experiences in mathematics.
ESS 30672	An overview of the principles of language structure, the processes of first and second language acquisition, and the issues involved in assessing language proficiency with special attention paid to the application of linguistic knowledge to the multilingual and multicultural school setting.
ESS 30682	“Innovative Practices in K-12 Education” introduces students to the past and present technology usage in the K-12 classroom, from the innovative to the controversial to the catastrophic. We will consider early attempts at using technology in education as well as barriers to innovation and counter-movements to remove all technology from instruction. Throughout the course, we will discuss ways to evaluate innovative pedagogical practices based on educational research best practices. Students will explore the limits of technology use in the classroom and determine what is helpful and harmful in creating learners who can think critically and solve real-world problems. Topics covered include what defines “technology” in the classroom, disruptive innovation, gamification, personalized and blended learning, inclusive education, and the emerging use (and possibilities) of AI in the classroom.
ESS 33523	This course strives to form a new community of inquiry at the intersection of religion, education, and democracy. It is at such an intersection that the atrophy of each—the central problem to be grappled with in the course—is seen by many to be caused by the values of the other. Are such claims true? Are religion, education, and democracy so incommensurable today that together they can no longer facilitate social coherence, despite the fact that robust educational systems have long bolstered democratic and religious institutions alike? With the discipline of education as its platform and Catholicism, among other religious voices, as its particular conversation partner, the course examines historical, contemporaneous, and ecclesial resources, including Catholic notions of the common good, fraternal humanism, and ecological conversion, to ask, among other questions: What has religion to do with present anti-democratic trends, and what can be done educationally to reverse them? How do we understand education differently when we view it from the perspective of religion, and vice versa? Why is education so prevalent in and fundamental to religion, especially Catholicism, in the United States? As people call for book bans, students will write on how debate, discussion, and dissension are normed and modeled differently by religious and secular philosophies of education. They will also write, assuming a Catholic philosophy of education as normative, on what relationship religion should have with education if the latter is fundamental to democracy while democracy itself serves as the guarantor of religious liberty. The goal of the course is to produce a philosophy of education that engenders in the current generation of students responsibility to the American proposition—to reference the Jesuit John Courtney Murray’s paradigm—and what we can call a religiously-informed, normative vision of the promise of “America” today.
ESS 33600	The aim of the introductory course is to introduce some basic questions about the nature and goals of education, its history, and theoretical explanations of influences on learning, teaching, and schooling. We will incorporate both classic and current texts. The core course will incorporate several disciplinary perspectives.
ESS 33614	This course is not for the faint of heart, but will explore the feint, adept, and deft use of Civics and History courses to try and create one ideal American narrative in K-12 classrooms. History in American K-12 classrooms and beyond is always political! Historical thinking is also supposed to be an active way of learning and establishing new ideas when there are new pieces of information or additional epistemologies not a passive regurgitation of facts. Join this class to struggle with how a more representative curriculum might help foster better-rounded citizens and broader critical thinking skills. Historical narratives created and true are installed in American curricula to create ‘good citizens,' but who determines what ‘good' is and who and what ‘citizens' are is an ever-changing pantheon of characters seeking god-like power over the nation's past, with aspirations of helping shape and control the nation's future. This course examines how historical events are molded and taught in curricula in different eras and shows the evolution of textbooks and curriculum firsthand. Students explore how early textbooks think of Native peoples as &quot;Noble Savages&quot; and how that ‘nobility' disappears in later texts. We'll have the opportunity to study the re-shaping of ethnic identities in the United States History curriculum and how the Cold War not only re-configures the size and orientation of the maps in our history books but also how the stories of other nations and their forms of government become commonplace slurs as a way to whip up righteousness for US policies in the Cold War and to quash rising ideologies connected to labor movements and those other nations simultaneously. We'll examine the rise and righteousness of both sides of the current debate over Critical Race Theory in the K-12 classroom and so much more. You will have the opportunity to explore additional historical narratives of Native peoples and many different groups who immigrants by choice, force, and forced annexations and their representations in curricula. This course recognizes the privileges that race, class, and gender has played in creating the historical narrative for K-12 classrooms through the study of the groups who make decisions about what civics and historical lessons are taught to students in American schools in different eras. This course will have writing and research elements go through multiple drafts and the final version of student works is not just academic in nature but is to demonstrate that you can utilize your knowledge and understanding for the good, to in essence show ‘what you are fighting for' in the parlance of all at Notre Dame working to bring academic thinking to the forefront for the common good. This course will require critical thinking, creative solutions and ideas on curricular philosophy, great classroom participation, a willingness to do original historical research, and a tremendous desire to share.
ESS 33629	In this course, we will challenge the single story/ies U.S. schools and curricula have told about books, characters, and cultural groups by focusing on literature by and about people from various populations that have been traditionally underrepresented in the United States.  We will discuss young adult literature from parallel cultures (including possible works by and about African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino/as, Native Americans, Middle Eastern Americans, and other ethnic groups), as well as literature by and about populations traditionally defined by class, religion, ability, gender and sexuality.  Course participants will investigate theoretical perspectives, issues, controversies, and educational implications for these texts, including race and racism, whiteness and privilege (in society and in the educational system), and critical literacy.  As an extension of the course, we will also examine the young adult literature market and how contemporary media may reinforce or resist the stereotypes, labels, and single stories associated with these cultures.   Possible texts include All American Boys, American Born Chinese (graphic novel), a Jacqueline Woodson novel, Openly Straight, a canonical text like To Kill a Mockingbird, Every Day, and several choice options, including a Classic/Newberry text, one text representing a non-abled bodied protagonist, and one contemporary text.
ESS 33632	Prior to the 18th century, children were viewed as little adults. The invention of childhood grew during the Age of Enlightenment along with a rapid increase of printed titles (1620: 6,000 vs. end of 18th century: 56,000). As a result, religious texts began to lose dominance over the written word and thus grew a new body of literature for children. The critical study and evaluation of literature for children has made significant growth since its modest beginnings in the early twentieth century, which we will examine in this course. We will also explore the creation of childhood, children as imagined readers, and how social, political, and cultural factors have influenced topics such as childhood, family, and religion in &quot;classic&quot; and award winning multicultural children's literature. By comparing literature with similar themes over time, we will explore how authors have reflected, challenged, or attempted to remain neutral in their writing about dominant social and cultural values and beliefs, especially those pertaining to race/racism, ethnic and cultural diversity, and equity and social justice. We will discuss literature within the context of historical and political events of when the work was published and consider how literature can be a reflection of a time-period and authors' political ideologies (Stephens, 1992; Sutherland, 1985). Finally, we will consider how literature can foster dialogue in K-8 classrooms to promote anti-racist counter-narratives to develop children's understanding of their role in contributing to a more just, equitable, and humane world.
ESS 36615	Student and Instructor will design readings relevant to a special interest in education.
ESS 40263	This course provides students with the opportunity to conduct educational programs with individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) while acquiring an in-depth knowledge of the individual, family, community, and cultural issues surrounding the diagnosis. For the practicum portion of the course, students will work within a structured program in a family home, on-average two times a weeks for at least four hours (50 hours over the course of the semester). For the in-class portion of the course, students will meet with the instructors to discuss current research/readings, important topics, and personal experiences related to ASD. It is our hope that through this course you will begin to gain an understanding of individuals with ASD and acquire the skills to support them and their families. In addition, you will continue to develop the communication skills (written and oral) that are crucial to be a successful professional in the field of developmental disabilities. Please note that a version of this course is offered at the 40000 level which has a significant writing requirement (and has additional required coursework, see listing). Other requirements: Unless other arrangements are made, students need to have a car or regular access to transportation. Access to a car can be arranged through the Center for Social Concerns.
ESS 41840	This course is a hands-on opportunity to work with a team on an ongoing project—School Story Lab—about people's experiences of being in school, and to amplify the work via social media. School Story Lab builds on both interviews and crowdsourced stories. The goal of the project is to collect and disseminate personal experiences of people (especially students and teachers) involved in schools at all levels, and internationally. Experience-near accounts of school should always be considered by policy makers and those charged with designing schools, but they are often overlooked in favor of simpler standardized measures. These experiences are affective, bodily, social, economic, medical, and more, not just cognitive. Stories provide it all. The course meets weekly for an hour, and students spend another 1-2 hours weekly working on the project: conducting and analyzing interviews, contributing to the website, and bringing their own experiences.
ESS 43643	One of the complicating factors in the formation of novice teachers has to do with the &quot;apprenticeship of observation:&quot; the fact that anyone who enters the teaching force has spent, as K-12 students, approximately 14,000 hours across 13 years watching teachers work. This 1-credit seminar, designed for prospective teachers and those interested in the practice of teaching, relies on community engagement, readings, focused observation of lessons from K-12 classrooms, reflection, and conversation with current K-12 teachers and school leaders to make visible the less apparent, and often quite complex, layers of teaching—like student engagement, learning, and classroom culture. By the end of the course, students will have developed a reflective framework that conditions them to know where and how to focus their professional development as they enter into more advanced education-related course and field work.
ESS 45600	This course provides students an opportunity for a pedagogical internship with an ESS faculty member.

EURO 20249	Eastern Christians and their Churches are an indispensable part of global Christianity that sheds light on its origins, its basic theological tenets, its achievements and its historical failures, dilemmas, and challenges. The course provides an overview of the variety of Eastern-rite Christian Churches belonging to the different cultural traditions of Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. The students will be introduced to the theological views and liturgical life of Eastern-rite Christians, i.e., Orthodox, Oriental, and Eastern Catholic, and their fascinating history. Special attention will be given to the Byzantine tradition, from the medieval period to our day. Russian and Ukrainian religious history and contemporary church life will be explored in more detail: we will focus on the challenges their theology and history present to contemporary world and international relations. Reflections on the diversity of Eastern Christian traditions lead to insights into theological, moral, and cultural issues such as ecumenism and Christian unity, war and peacemaking, Christianity and totalitarianism, the role of liturgy and ritual in modern culture.
EURO 20400	This course will focus on the practical use of French in an international professional environment. Emphasis will be placed on developing communicative skills and cultural knowledge necessary for the professional world. Students will review relevant structures and vocabulary needed to accomplish specific tasks and skills necessary in a broadly-defined formal professional setting.
EURO 20650	In the intricate and interconnected society of the Late Middle Ages in the Mediterranean Basin (12th-15th Centuries), the short story emerged as a dominant literary genre, transcending cultural and geographic boundaries. The Mediterranean’s bustling commercial networks served as a conduit for stories, knowledge, and people, bridging distant shores.  During this era, Italians held sway as the Mediterranean’s foremost commercial and naval power, a dominance reflected in the multitude of short story collections written from the 12th to the 14th Centuries. Figures like Giovanni Boccaccio, Franco Sacchetti, and Giovanni Sercambi skillfully portrayed the sociological, geographical, historical, and psychological intricacies of this cultural crossroads.  The short story explored diverse themes, including courtly love, the Crusades, the interplay of the three Monotheistic Religions, class struggles, varied perspectives on women’s roles from Spain to the Arabic domains, and encounters between different cultures. This genre provided a window into the era’s multifaceted facets.  This course aims to delve into the historical tapestry of the multiethnic and multicultural Italian peninsula during the Late Middle Ages. Through Italian short stories, we will explore its cultures, geography, and traditions, gaining insights into this captivating period. 
EURO 30006	This course will prepare students to participate in the Midwest Model EU simulation hosted by Indiana University, Bloomington. Through class meetings, assigned readings, and a final written &quot;Draft Directive&quot; to be used during the simulation, students will gain a practical understanding of the purpose and functioning of European institutions and European politics. In addition to familiarity with current EU policy issues and current events, students will gain an understanding of and experience with executing member states' policy positions, various EU decision making processes, and EU policy creation. The course culminates with students' participation in Midwest Model EU at the beginning of April, representing European state governments in intergovernmental policy creation.
EURO 30007	Diplomacy in its many forms is a way of doing politics: the established method of negotiating inter-state relations and of influencing the decisions and behavior of foreign governments and peoples through presence and engagement, dialogue, and negotiation. Diplomats are committed to their home country, but also their host country and the bigger picture of the common good. Contributors to peace building and peacekeeping, diplomats, serve political purposes through cultural engagement. In this way, they contribute to &quot;integral human development&quot; in the design of international relations. The Nanovic Institute invites undergraduate and graduate students to join our Diplomacy Scholars Program through Deep Dive Into Diplomacy. This course will examine diplomacy as a tool for social justice while providing students the opportunity to hone diplomatic skills such as conflict mediation, judgement and decision making, intercultural competencies, and written and oral communication. Students will learn from present and former diplomats about the diplomatic way of life and participate in a number of simulations and activities beyond the classroom. Enrollment in this course is by application only.
EURO 30102	What can we learn about Europe by exploring its cinema? Based on an extended version of the Institute's film series each semester, the content of this course will focus on the relationship between contemporary European cinema and the European ideas and realities it finds compelling in terms of social and imaginative power. The course will include some history of cinema, but emphasis will be laid on using cinema as a way of stimulating questions about the nature of Europe today. Open to students of all years and majors.
EURO 30112	Germany is globally recognized as a leader in the fields of renewable energy, sustainable development, and environmental protection. But how did this come about? In this course, we will examine the roles that culture and history play in shaping human attitudes towards the environment. Our case studies will range over two centuries, from damming projects in the Rhine valley at the start of the nineteenth century to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster at the end of the twentieth. We will study novels, films, and philosophical essays alongside works by leading environmental historians. Over the course of the semester, students will develop a richer understanding of German environmentalism that also includes an awareness of its dark sides, such as the role that nature conservancy played within Nazi ideology.
EURO 30128	This course will examine Irish poetry, written both in Irish and English, through the prism of protest. A translation into English will be available for the poems in Irish. We will explore the public role occupied by the poet in Ireland and the concurrent anxieties and responsibilities of the role. The course will examine the formal prosodic dimensions of the poems and students will also learn about the historical circumstances in which the poems were produced. The course will include the work of WB Yeats, PH Pearse, JM Plunkett, Seán Ó Ríordáin, Máirtín Ó Direáin, John Montague, Seamus Heaney, Máire Mhac an tSaoi, Eavan Boland, Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill, Paul Durcan, Paula Meehan, Liam Ó Muirthile, Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin, Michael O’Loughlin, Aifric MacAodha, Thomas McCarthy, Ciaran Carson, Theo Dorgan, Gerry Murphy, Gail McConnell, Rachael Hegarty, Trevor Joyce . The course will be delivered in a chronological and thematic fashion. Learning outcomes: Knowledge and appreciation of contemporary Irish Poetry  
EURO 30130	This course looks at the way in which Ireland is remembered. It will do so by looking at different sources of memorialisation. The course will examine the memory of the diaspora and the representation of Ireland through songs and memoirs.  It will be anchored both in the question of memory studies, drawing on the work of philosophers such as Paul Ricoeur. It will explore what gets remembered in times of commemoration of historical events, such as the 1916 Rising or the Great Famine. Students will also examine the notion of nostalgia. Other sources that will be studied in the course will be photographs, films, paintings and statues.
EURO 30141	This course examines the origins and development of contemporary opinions and policies concerning migrations and migrants. It does so by looking backward to the age when transoceanic mobility became more frequent and increasingly more accessible before moving forward to our own times. It is the central claim of this course that it is impossible to understand what drives policy today without first surveying the changing ideas of migration and the movement of people over time. It will therefore take students through the history of migration in the modern world, as well as studying the migrant journey, connections to home, the process and difficulties of assimilation and community creation, and the problems or opportunities that could arise for migrants from characteristics like race, religion, ethnicity, or language. Also considered will be the complex relationship between colonization and migration. In the process, Migrants and Mobility will also examine how different societies place value judgments upon migrants and analyze how and why migration/migrants have been categorized as “good” or “bad” over time. Students will also encounter and consider the effects of growing urbanization and industrialization, changing demography and global trade patterns, and, more recently, the impact of climate change. Migrants and Mobility will be primarily seminar based, placing a premium on participation and analytical discussion.
EURO 30217	This class analyzes the politics and cultures of remembrance in Europe from the late nineteenth century to today. Taking examples such as the politicization of Holocaust memory in Europe or the grassroots removal of monuments in Britain as points of departure, students will learn about processes of remembering and forgetting, and how memories of the past have shaped European identity and culture in the 20th and 21st centuries. We will pay particular attention to the mobilization and commemoration of Europe's traumatic pasts, including the World Wars, imperialism and decolonization, the Cold War, and histories of genocide, to investigate how Europeans have remembered these difficult histories and how these memories have shifted over time. We will look not only at how the traumatic past is represented today; but how memory work was enacted at the time and how Europeans have fought to revise these representations and demand new recognition of alternative visions of the past.  In its focus on memory, broadly defined, this course will deeply explore how representations of the past have shaped European identity, culture, and politics both at the time and today.   In its focus on memory and memorialization, this class also attends to the visuality and material culture of history and historical research. Students will learn to read visual and material sources as sources akin to political tracts, diaries, and memoirs. We will engage with sources including photo albums, monuments, memorials, museum spaces, memorial landscapes, film, cultural kitsch, and art all as critical primary sources to understanding the production and circulation of memory. We will read foundational texts on collective memory and remembrance to understand how scholars and theorists have defined and conceptualized memory. Students will also conduct an original research project on a topic of their choosing by exploring a case study of memory work or collective memory in the context of Modern Europe.
EURO 30219	Economic policy affects us all. That is why the best approach to solving the challenges that arise from it is an interdisciplinary one. From political science to economics to global affairs, each discipline offers something to this conversation that transcends national borders. Traditionally, they have operated in silos, but this course seeks to bring them together to address six multidisciplinary challenges facing contemporary society, including:  𝐓𝐡𝐞 (𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐝) 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞-𝐨𝐟𝐟 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲/𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲— How do societies balance the need for efficiency with a view to preventing or reducing inequality? Is this perceived trade-off actually a trade-off?  𝐊𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐥𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐞, 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐭𝐡: 𝐚 𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧-𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 — What is the root of innovation? How do external motivators and intrinsic motivations interact to stimulate growth? What is the role of government in these questions, and how has the European Union approached them?  𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 — How can we protect the environment and ensure a thriving ecosystem for generations to come while meeting our socio-economic needs? What is the relationship between sustainability and innovation in today’s rapidly evolving green tech market?  𝐑𝐨𝐛𝐨𝐭𝐬, 𝐀𝐈, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐮𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 — To what extent will the rapid iteration of AI technology affect the world of work? How is the deployment of generative AI unique compared to previous automation movements?  𝐆𝐥𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐥 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐬, 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐝𝐲𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐬 — How do nations and businesses fit a value chain that occurs across borders?  𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐦 𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐠𝐚𝐩 — How does the growing wage gap, even across firms in the same sector, relate to questions of inequality?  Students will learn about how the European Union is addressing each challenge, as well as offering space for reflection on global responses. Students will come away from the course with a strong understanding of how Europe and the world see each topic and the implications for future policy decisions, ethics, and diplomacy.
EURO 30314	A cliché, a painful truth, an old story, a new one—this course explores alcohol and alcoholism in Irish literature, Irish society and Irishness, examining how alcohol infuses the stories Irish people tell and those told about them, and asking what happens if we take alcohol(ism) seriously as a framework and topic of analysis. We will think about the romance and conviviality of drink and drinking, pubs and wakes and more; and counterposed crusades against drinking (by Father Mathew and others), as well as the unromantic and destructive dimension so central to recent writing. We will think about alcohol(ism) in relation to political authority and nationalism, as well as in relation to colonial resistance, recalcitrance and recovery. We will ask how this &quot;inheritance&quot; travels into Irish America, and even to this campus, asking what legacies are being lived out, and why, and what we make of that. The course will feature a diverse set of texts across a span of Irish literary tradition, including medieval and contemporary, fiction and memoir, poetry and prose, verbal, visual and musical media. On the way students will work on their speaking, analytical and writing skills. Course work will include short writing assignments and analytical papers, a presentation, and a creative assignment.
EURO 30453	The French Revolution created a turning point in history by paving the way for modern politics and society. Napoleon's empire, on the other hand, toppled some of the oldest European monarchies and shook up the international status quo. During two and a half turbulent decades, the French destroyed feudalism, created a constitutional monarchy, founded a republic, and built an empire that stretched across the continent. Our course will focus on how the French reinvented the social, cultural, and political dimensions of their world from the 1780s to 1815. We will ask major questions such as: What were the origins of the French Revolution? How did the revolutionaries recreate political culture and social structures? Why did the Revolution radicalize at first but eventually slide into an empire? Was Napoleon the &quot;son of the Revolution&quot; or did he betray its major goals? Of special note, our course includes a 4-week &quot;Reacting to the Past&quot; game that allows you to engage in history from a completely new perspective. During this historical role-playing unit, you will become a specific member of the National Assembly or the Parisian crowd. To win, you must pass a constitution favorable to your position while wrestling &quot;with the threat of foreign invasion, political and religious struggles, and questions of liberty and citizenship.&quot; Although we may change the course of history within the unit, you will root your arguments in resources available to your historical persona: primary documents, political treatises, inspiring speeches, secret collaborations, and &quot;current&quot; events.
EURO 30456	Between the early rumblings of the Reformations and the last cannon shot of World War I, Europeans profoundly changed how they conceptualized bodies as experience and metaphors. During these four centuries, Europeans grounded the ways in which they interacted with each other and the world in bodily imaginings. On an individual level, the living, human body provided a means of accessing and understanding the material or spiritual world. On a collective scale, the physical body, its adornments, and its gestures provided markers that Europeans used to fracture society along axes of gender, sexuality, class, race, mental aptitude, and even sacrality. Drawing in part from their myriad imaginings of the human body, Europeans constructed metaphorical political bodies. The body politic assumed diverse forms spanning from divine right monarchs to revolutionary republics to modern nation states. Our course will lay bare the human body as culturally constructed, while fleshing out how Europeans' evolving visions affected political imaginings.
EURO 30505	This is an introductory course for complete beginners in Ukrainian. The course aims to provide a solid foundation in four major communicative skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Students will learn to communicate effectively across cultural and linguistic boundaries while developing knowledge of the Ukrainian language, traditions, and culture. Emphasis is placed on the acquisition of basic structures, vocabulary, and sound systems. Students will be encouraged to use their language skills to communicate and interact in a variety of situations and contexts. Cultural awareness will be enhanced with authentic audio-visual materials, literary texts, and cultural artifacts. By the end of the course, students will be able to read short original Ukrainian texts and communicate on everyday topics. No prerequisite.
EURO 30554	This class introduces students to the history of Catholicism since the French Revolution, focusing primarily on Europe. It examines how Catholics confronted the challenges of modernity - from liberal democracy and nationalism; to capitalism and modern science; to new political ideologies such as fascism and communism. We will explore not only how these encounters transformed the Church, but also how Catholicism itself has shaped modern politics and culture. The first part of the course begins with the nineteenth-century - culture wars - between Catholics and anticlerical forces, focusing in particular on popular devotions like the Lourdes pilgrimage and the perceived &quot;feminization&quot; of religion. The second part of the course shifts to the twentieth century and examines the relationship between the Catholic Church and modern political ideologies such as nationalism, fascism, communism, and democracy. The third part of the course explores modern Catholic art, literature, and film. Finally, we close by examining the more recent history of Catholicism since the transformative changes of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. Readings are drawn from a range of primary sources - including novels, speeches, Church documents, works of art, and films - as well as secondary sources by historians.
EURO 30605	From country pastor to cathedral villain, from merciful bishop to weaselly lecher, the image of the Roman Catholic priest in French culture is nothing if not versatile. But what purpose does that versatility serve? Is the image of the priest simply all things to all people as a matter of utility, an easy target - for good or for ill - that provides to authors, artists, or directors a shortcut to a good laugh or to a character that their audience will love to hate? This course will explore the image of the priest in France from the Middle Ages to the present day in its varied manifestations in literature, film, and art. We will examine what the broad spectrum of representations reveals about the state of the French Church at any given moment in history, about the theology of the priesthood, or about clericalism and anticlericalism in a political or social context. In a moment when the meaning of the priesthood in the Catholic Church and beyond continues to be contested, a study of the French context will yield a deeper understanding of the priest and his role as an embodiment of the Church and its authority. Taught in English, with course materials available both in English and the original French.
EURO 30721	Renowned for its rich past but full of contradictions that persist to the present day, Italy has one of the most fascinating histories and abundant cultures in the modern world. This course provides a unique perspective onto Italian modernity by exploring the wealth of Italy’s modern and contemporary cultural production. We will focus on key issues that unveil the unique “spirit” of modern Italy, such as the weight of the past, the tension between political realism and idealism, the recurrence of social and political crises, immigration, revolution, and youth culture.  We will investigate how issues of gender, class, race, identity, and faith have shaped Italian literature, film, and theatre in the modern age. Through the study of texts, films, and other media, the course seeks to understand the development of modern Italy and its future trajectory. Authors studied will include Dario Fo, Natalia Ginzburg, Eugenio Montale, Elsa Morante, Anna Maria Ortese, Luigi Pirandello, Igiaba Scego, and Elio Vittorini. Taught in Italian. Pre-requisite: ROIT 20202 or 20215 or equivalent.
EURO 33012	This course is required for all students accepted to the Serving (in) Europe program. Students will prepare for their internships by engaging with relevant literature on social justice and humanitarian issues in Europe as well as regular meetings with their Caritas host organization. Each student will engage in an eight week service internship at a faith-based charitable organization in Europe. The locations include Bulgaria, Italy, Poland, and Slovakia. This course will meet once each week for a short lecture and discussion which will enable them to consider what they are likely to encounter, and to learn about each of the sites where they will serve. The course will provide an examination of Catholic Social Teaching as a way to approach the world, especially those living on the peripheries.
EURO 33027	As soon as Europeans began exploring and colonizing the so-called New World, Germans were there. Germans came to the Americas as conquistadors, settlers, refugees, missionaries, and merchants. The German colony in Venezuela was disastrously short-lived, but Germans came to play a significant role in the colonization of North America through the settlement of Pennsylvania. This course introduces students to the varieties of German presence in the Americas from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Topics may include the colonization and conquest of South America, German interactions with Indigenous communities, German missionaries to the enslaved peoples in the Caribbean, the role of German immigrants in early anti-slavery and pacifist movements, and the origin and afterlife of the language called Pennsylvania Dutch. This course will be taught in English.
EURO 33101	 In 1987, the Soviet Union was the largest political entity on the planet. Four years later, it had vanished from the map entirely. In this interdisciplinary course, you will learn about the ‘new Russia’ that has emerged in the three decades since this stunning collapse. Drawing on an array of resources in English translation, you will explore the politics, media, and culture of the post-Soviet period: from the lawless years of the “wild 90s” under Boris Yeltsin to the return of totalitarianism under Vladimir Putin and his brutal invasion of Ukraine. In so doing, your study of contemporary Russia will lead us to discuss some of the most pressing questions in global politics today. What is the nature of truth and power in Putin’s dystopian propaganda state? Should the current leadership in Russia be described as a fascist regime or neo-Soviet? And, perhaps most importantly, how did Russia’s democratic experiment ultimately end with the launch of the largest war in Europe since 1945—and what lessons might this failure hold for America and the rest of the world?
EURO 33205	With a focus on Germany, this course treats contemporary European responses to the influx of migrants and refugees. It includes a weeklong residential stay in Berlin during spring break (departing campus March 8, returning March 17, 2024). Enrollment only via competitive essay to the Nanovic Institute. Applications are due on November 3, 2023.
EURO 33206	This course explores the historical relationship between the Catholic Church and the rise and fall of European overseas empires since the sixteenth century. We will consider how Catholic missionaries both reinforced and resisted colonial power structures; how the Church made sense of racial, religious, and cultural differences in its efforts to evangelize colonial subjects; how African, Asian, and Latin American Catholics developed their own distinctive spiritual practices; and how Catholics in both Europe and its former colonies grappled with the challenge of decolonization and how to undo the legacies of colonialism within the Church itself. Readings will be drawn from a range of sources, including missionary diaries and manuals, memoirs, artwork, papal encyclicals, films, novels, works of theology, and historical scholarship.
EURO 33702	The International Business Scholars Colloquium is a 1.5 credit undergraduate course affiliated with and organized by the Business Ethics and Society Program (BESP) at the Mendoza College of Business and the Nanovic Institute for European Studies in the Keough School of Global Affairs. The course runs for both the fall and spring semesters, 1.5 credits per semester. A small group of selected students will meet in-person weekly to discuss assigned readings, to listen to and engage with invited speakers, and to form a community of Notre Dame business and/or other students interested in global affairs (with particular emphasis on Europe), to explore the nature of honorable business within our globalized world, and the ethical and professional challenges and opportunities for pursuing business as a force for good in the international context(s). The first hour of class will be dedicated to discussion of readings or an invited speaker. During the second hour, we may have a meal together and continue informal discussion and conversation with faculty and invited practitioners. International Business Scholars will be encouraged to participate in the activities of the BESP and the Nanovic Institute beyond the Colloquium (occasional lectures, panels, etc.). As a capstone immersion experience, students may be able to participate in an international trip exploring the challenges and opportunities of business in a foreign country in the spring of 2024.  Students interested in the colloquium should contact Prof. John Sikorski to obtain instructor permission for enrollment in the colloquium (jsikors2@nd.edu). 
EURO 40370	The passage from the nineteenth to the twentieth century was a period of great hope but also of great anxiety. While nobody could predict the coming of the First World War, pre-apocalyptic restlessness dominated culture, especially in the young nation of Italy. Modernity promised ever greater improvements in living conditions, but it also laid bare its contradictions: social inequalities, political conflict and polarization, and the abyss of existential angst, which afflicted so many and so much.  From fiction to poetry, from theater to visual arts, we will study how the great Italian authors of this period like Nobel Prize winner Luigi Pirandello, Gabriele d’Annunzio, Filippo T. Marinetti and the Italian Futurists bore witness to the transformations of the modern era. Some prospected a societal collapse and yearned for a rebirth accelerated by avant-garde aesthetics, while others escaped into individualistic introspection for personal and spiritual actualization.  We will explore the tensions of Italian literary Modernism, which live on to this day: progressivism with reactionism, nationalism with cosmopolitanism, regionalism with immigration, capitalism with socialism, pacifism with warmongering, religion with secularization and existentialism, to see why the turn of the century left an indelible mark for the centuries to come.  Taught in Italian. Italian 202 is a prerequisite for this course.
EURO 40715	The nineteenth century saw the rise of print media and professional institutions. Old-fashioned whisper networks came to be viewed suspiciously as a dangerous, “feminine” pastime for those without lives of their own. Yet the enduring popularity of gossip—in society columns, romans-à-clef, communal laundry rooms, and political caricatures—meant that informal social networks thrived, fueled by a heightened interest in the private lives of famous people. The learning goals of this class extend beyond those of textual analysis and the researched argument to media literacy. Following several scandals across a variety of sources, we will study how information was transmitted via different genres, spaces, and voices in nineteenth-century France, looking at a range of texts from broadsheets to Offenbach operettas. While reinforcing social mores, gossip also provided a means of resistance to the status quo, a way for the marginalized to reframe official narratives and point to the humanity shared across classes and identities. Taught in French.
EURO 40940	This course focuses on literary works in French that have received illustrious prizes, from the Nobel Prize to the Prix Goncourt, and it examines questions related to the prestige of publishing houses and the role of marketing techniques meant to package and sell books alongside questions of influence and imitation, and of possible accusations of plagiarism. The course’s tripartite emphasis on the ways in which authors and their textual creations are celebrated, circulated, and questioned is complemented by an analysis of how these award-winning attempts to decolonize literature in French constitute a contemporary quest with profound historical and intertextual resonances. We read literary works of a great variety, including novels by Nobel prizewinning authors Annie Ernaux (the first Frenchwoman ever to win this award in 2022) and Jean-Marie Le Clézio, Goncourt prizewinning authors Mohamed Mbougar Sarr (the first Sub-Saharan African to win this award in 2021) and Leïla Slimani, as well as works by other writers who are caught up in telling striking stories that involve intersecting understandings of the complexities of race, class, and gender that have too often been missing from the literary landscape in French.
EURO 48001	Research course for the capstone essay required for the Minor in European Studies through the Nanovic Institute. May not be double-counted for thesis credit in a major field of study. Department approval required before registration.
EURO 60007	Diplomacy in its many forms is a way of doing politics: the established method of negotiating inter-state relations and of influencing the decisions and behavior of foreign governments and peoples through presence and engagement, dialogue, and negotiation. Diplomats are committed to their home country, but also their host country and the bigger picture of the common good. Contributors to peace building and peacekeeping, diplomats, serve political purposes through cultural engagement. In this way, they contribute to &quot;integral human development&quot; in the design of international relations. The Nanovic Institute invites undergraduate and graduate students to join our Diplomacy Scholars Program through Deep Dive Into Diplomacy. This course will examine diplomacy as a tool for social justice while providing students the opportunity to hone diplomatic skills such as conflict mediation, judgement and decision making, intercultural competencies, and written and oral communication. Students will learn from present and former diplomats about the diplomatic way of life and participate in a number of simulations and activities beyond the classroom. Enrollment in this course is by application only.
EURO 63205	With a focus on Germany, this course treats contemporary European responses to the influx of migrants and refugees. It includes a weeklong residential stay in Berlin during spring break (departing campus March 8, returning March 17, 2024). Enrollment only via competitive essay to the Nanovic Institute. Applications are due on November 3, 2023.

FIN 30402	This section is an honors section and satisfies requirements in the Business Scholars program.  The course gives a broad overview of the theory of corporate finance with the objective to develop students' ability to apply financial principles to decision making in a corporate environment.  The course introduces several of the firm's financial policy decisions such as optimal capital structure, payout policy, and capital raising and further develops valuation skills to help determine the firm's best investment opportunities in the presence of more realistic market imperfections.  The course starts from where FIN 20510 (Fundamentals of Finance) left off without much review.  The accelerated nature of the course allows one to introduce further advanced topics such as security design, mergers and acquisitions, and possibly others, time permitting. The course identifies and examines the issues faced by corporations in greater depth by presenting empirical research results and real case discussions.  If you felt comfortable with the material covered in FIN 20510 Fundamentals of Finance, are curious about how corporations make decisions, and are ready to move at a faster pace, this may be the course for you.  It will help you develop the necessary skills to pursue more advanced finance courses and become a successful finance professional and leader, but also should make you think and realize the complexity and non trivial nature of the corporate financial world.  I find the subject useful, fascinating, and thought provoking; I hope you will too.

FTT 13182	This writing intensive course will be devoted to a variety of different topics in film, television, new media and theatre depending on the individual instructor's interests. Note: Freshmen only.
FTT 20101	This class is designed to enhance your understanding and appreciation of film and television. It operates on the philosophy that the better we understand how film and television texts work, the more intelligently and perceptively we will be able to consume them, which is an invaluable skill to have in our media-saturated world. You will learn about the basic elements that distinguish films and television programs from other aesthetic forms, such as editing, cinematography, sound and set design, and how these components work together to develop stories and characters. We will also work with interpretive frameworks that uncover deeper meanings and patterns in film and television, such as genre theory, the idea of authorship, political economy, and ideological analysis. Finally, you will acquire the skills and tools needed to write your own educated analyses of film and television texts. The class screenings present a range of films, from Hollywood classics to independent and international films, as well as television shows both old and new. This course is required for all concentrators in Film and Television.
FTT 20260	In this course you will explore the genre of the telenovela (a major social, cultural, political, and economic force in Latin America and, more recently, in the United States) by reading about the genre (in Spanish) and watching two condensed telenovelas (also in Spanish). You will demonstrate your understanding of the telenovela and its importance in Hispanic culture through writing and discussion and through application of these ideas as you write, produce, direct, act in, record and edit a mini-telenovela as a class. During this process you will learn and apply basic production (videography) and post-production (computer based video and audio editing) techniques. Course taught in Spanish 
FTT 20320	It has long-been a part of Notre Dame's Saturday football tradition. As uniformed players leave the locker room and descend a tight stairwell to the field below, they reach up and touch the iconic &quot;Play Like a Champion Today&quot; sign. Countless players, students, and fans have touched the sign over the years, hoping to imbibe some illusive and ineffable Fighting Irish magic. But what does it mean to &quot;play like a champion today&quot; ... or any day, really? More simply, what does it mean to play? Play is an inescapable and essential part of the human condition. And, yet, the experience's core liminality defies easy definition and explanation.  This course provides an introduction to the study of human play primarily through the lens of analog and digital games. It is designed for first- and second-year students from a range of backgrounds and disciplines. Given the variety of play practices across human history and cultures, this class strives to equip students with a critical vocabulary and interpretive framework to help them make sense of play in its many forms. This class will pay particular attention to how rules, goals, game mechanics, and narratives offer reliable and compelling structures for gameplay, and what ludic activities reveal about social power.
FTT 20720	Collaboration, the Art of Making Theatre explores the roles of the artists who create the material world in which a performance exists and most importantly, the collaborative nature of those relationships.  Students will be challenged to understand the thinking behind the work of the designers, writers, directors, and off-stage personnel who bring stories to life on stage.  Incorporating hands on projects as well as lecture/discussion formats, students will experiment with story telling through the visual elements of scenery, costumes, lighting, etc.  Collaboration, the Art of Making Theatre is an excellent entry point to the Theatre Concentration.
FTT 21001	Acting Process introduces the student to the core techniques of acting for the stage. The course engages both the analytical and the creative mind as students use research and analysis to support their physical, vocal and imaginative approaches to creating compelling scripted and improvised scenes. Students will rehearse and prepare scenes outside of class (with a partner and solo) for in-class performance.  All students must see two live theatrical performances and turn in a reflection for each.
FTT 21006	This course is designed to introduce students to creating original work for the theater. The course will explore the writing process as well as models from contemporary U.S. theater with the aim to present a variety of paths toward creating new, vibrant plays. This is primarily a writing course. In addition, by reading and discussing ten separate dynamic play texts, we will analyze dramatic writing. Weekly writing exercises, movement work, visual arts approaches, improvisation techniques and collaborative discussions will create resources for rich play material, which each student will eventually use in a final scene, presented in a public reading at the end of the semester.
FTT 21101	During the lab times, certain films will be viewed for further discussion in class.
FTT 21320	This is the lab component for FTT 20320, Play Like a Champion lecture. Students must take both the lecture and lab.
FTT 22101	A tutorial to be taken in conjunction with the Basics of Film &amp; Television course.
FTT 30021	In this course students will learn the principles of vocal production for acting in any medium.  The class will use physical and vocal exercises to explore the relationship between alignment, respiration, and relaxation.  Articulation and phonetics will be emphasized throughout the coursework.  In addition to learning the standard dialect rules of American English, students will research and analyze the sounds and ethnographic influences of several dialects, as well as perform short monologues and/or scenes in those dialects.  Students can expect to work on three to five dialects throughout the semester
FTT 30030	This course focuses on some of the most influential art films of the twenty-first century. While each of them has been critically acclaimed, we’ll use a comparative approach to explore their points of contact and divergence. How do prestige or “indie” films function as a particular type of content in entertainment landscapes defined by streaming and transmediation? How can we use films to pose questions about the relationship between national and global cultures?    Featured films will likely include:  In the Mood for Love, Mulholland Drive, Spirited Away, Lagaan, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Moonlight, Roma, Before Sunrise/Before Sunset, Mustang, Grand Budapest Hotel, The Great Beauty, Timbuktu, Happy as Lazzaro, Faces, Places, etc.
FTT 30103	What can we learn about Europe by exploring its cinema? Based on an extended version of the Institute's film series each semester, the content of this course will focus on the relationship between contemporary European cinema and the European ideas and realities it finds compelling in terms of social and imaginative power. The course will include some history of cinema, but emphasis will be laid on using cinema as a way of stimulating questions about the nature of Europe today. Open to students of all years and majors.
FTT 30132	Applied Multimedia for Journalists - The main focus of this course is that students will learn how to shoot and edit videos.

The use of drones and the legal issues surrounding them will also be discussed.
FTT 30150	This course aims to change the way you think not only about the way that we play games, but also about the way that video games teach their players to behave within their digital worlds. This course will encourage students to reflect on and utilize their lived experiences as players, and utilize these experiences to locate themselves within their analysis and writing as well as their design practices. This course will undertake an intensive, interdisciplinary focus on the history of video game development, representation in video games, and the languages that digital games work in as well as decolonial theory and diverse theories of design. This class will engage with a variety of scholarly texts, video games, media posts, videos, and design exercises, in order to illustrate the ways in which video games have shaped the ways we play, think, and behave within their spaces. Students will be required to write and design around these lessons and address and push back against the problematic behaviors and colonial narratives around violence, race, gender, sexuality, and relationship to the land that these gamic languages and lessons have created.
FTT 30151	Taught by former ESPN anchor, Emmy award-winning sports reporter, and President of Game Day Communications Betsy Ross, Game Day Media will delve into the preparation and performance of game day media opportunities: play by play personnel, color analysts, Public Address talent, news conference moderators and more. This is a 50/50 zoom and class will meet in person and over zoom/ class. Students will record play-by play/analyst segments from campus sports, conduct pre-game interviews and post-game news conferences and observe the intricacies of public address announcing.
FTT 30196	This course offers a multidisciplinary introduction to the vast variety of theoretical approaches used to understand media and technologies. From film, TV, and videogames to computers, internet, and social media, we will study different methods and concepts that help us understand our mediated condition(s) better. Moving historically and geographically, we will also encounter the many ways in which the term 'media' itself gets deployed and critiqued in scholarship across humanistic and social scientific disciplines. We will plug some of these (critical) theoretical understandings of media and culture into the longer histories of politics, philosophy, language, and literature, considering, for example, books as media technologies. And finally, we will ask what studies of media and mediation can do for our comprehension of the politico-economic, sociocultural, racial, and environmental crises surrounding us today.
FTT 30202	This course traces the major developments in world cinema from the post-WWII era to the present. The course will examine the shifting social, economic, technological, and aesthetic conditions of this period, especially the demise of the Hollywood studio system, the rise of new technologies and auxiliary marketing outlets, and the increasing globalization of cinema. The course will not be limited to Hollywood filmmaking, but will also look at various international movements, including Italian Neorealism, the French New Wave, and recent Asian cinemas.
FTT 30410	An introductory course in the fundamentals of writing, filming, and editing film and television productions. This is a hands-on production course emphasizing aesthetics, creativity, and technical expertise with the goal of learning the many aspects of successful visual storytelling. The course requires significant amounts of filming and editing outside of class. Students write and produce short, single camera narrative projects using Canon C100 cameras, editing with Adobe Premiere Pro. The principles of three-camera studio production are also covered. Cannot have taken FTT 30405 or FTT 50505.
FTT 30421	This course will consider and expand the spatial possibilities of installation using the medium of video. Focusing on spatial design, we will explore the ways to present video in both virtual and physical spaces. Looking at contemporary examples of video art that have global significance, we will discuss their effect and social impact. The technical components of the class include Adobe After Effects, a new motion capture software, a basic introduction to Autodesk Maya and VR, and projection mapping. The goal will be to create immersive experiences with video, culminating in a projection mapped or 3D/VR project. We will learn how to problem solve when faced with the physical realities of video installation. Over the semester we will acquire a critical awareness of our relationship to society as digital makers.
FTT 30456	In this course, students will learn different theories, methods, and approaches to understanding and writing about screen cultures. We will explore approaches that consider aesthetics/style, narrative, authorship (directors, show runners, stars), genre (e.g. the musical, horror), history (history of film/media industries, history of visual spectacle, historical context for films/media, etc.), technologies (sound, color, digital technologies, etc.), identities (considerations of gender, sexuality, race, nation, age, etc.), and audience (reception, fandom).  Students will: Read theories that articulate and advocate each approach; consider the parameters, value, and appeal of that approach, as well as its limitations; practice each approach in written exercises; and research and write a final paper using one or more of these approaches. Students may also use video essays or other media as tools of analysis and critique.    This is a course in academic criticism, not journalistic reviewing. Strong emphasis will be placed on argumentative writing. 
FTT 30459	An introduction to the study of gender and rock culture, this course provides students with a broad, foundational understanding of the concepts, theories, and methodologies used in critical analyses of rock's various gendered constructions. Rather than taking a musicological perspective, this course uses a socio-cultural approach to examine a myriad of gendered sites within rock culture, including performance, music video, and rock journalism. Therefore, music and song lyrics will not be our only or primary objects of study; our exploration of rock's gendered culture will also include studies of the various roles, practices, technologies, and institutions associated with he production and a synthetic, interdisciplinary approach is employed which draws on theories and methodologies formulated in such fields as popular music criticism, musicology, cultural studies, sociology, ethnography, literary analysis, performance studies, and critical media studies. In turn, the course is informed by feminist scholarship and theories of gender.
FTT 30461	Television has been widely available in the United States for only half a century, yet aleady it has become a key means through which we understand our culture.   Our course examines this vital medium from three perspectives.  First, we will look at the industrial, economic and technological forces that have shaped U.S. television since its inception.  These factors help explain how U.S. television adopted the format of advertiser-supported broadcast networks and why this format is changing today.  Second, we will explore television's role in American social and political life: how TV has represented cultural changes in the areas of gender, class, race and ethnicity. Third, we will discuss specific narrative and visual strategies that characterize program formats.    Throughout the semester we will demonstrate how television and U.S. culture mutually influence one another, as television both constructs our view of the world and is affected by social and cultural forces within the U.S. 
FTT 30480	The Game, as we experience it on screens big and small, is an ever evolving story. A human competition turned into a visual narrative by producers, directors, and broadcasters. How is that three hour ebb and flow of emotions turned into an engaging narrative for fans? How has that story evolved over decades? How has the evolution of technology changed that story? And has the televised broadcast changed the meaning of the game itself? From the Super Bowl to March Madness, ESPN Sportscenter to WWE Smackdown, we'll dissect the process, storytelling techniques and technology that form the American sports story on television, as well as experience the actual game production operation from inside the control rooms of Notre Dame Studios. Assignments include on-camera and off-camera production exercises, as well as written assignments deconstructing historical and current broadcasts. No prior television production experience required.
FTT 30511	Students will be able to improve their argumentative and analytical skills through the study of key issues and concepts in film studies. Film form and narrative, gender, class, stereotypes, the film auteur, cultural industry, violence and social denunciation will be some of the topics explored for the exploration of Brazilian case studies. Special emphasis will be given to the retomada -the rebirth of Brazilian cinema from the mid 1990s on - with in-depth analyses of feature films such as Carlota Joaquina (Carla Camurati, 1995), Central do Brasil (Walter Salles, 1998), CIdade de Deus (Fernando Meirelles, 2002) and Tropa de Elite (Jose' Padilha, 2007); documentary movies such as Edifcio Master (Eduardo Coutinho, 2002) and Santiago (Joao Moreira Salles, 2007) , as well as short movies such as Recife Frio (Kleber Mendonca Filho, 2009) and Eu nao Quero Voltar Sozinho (Daniel Ribeiro, 2010). Taught in English.
FTT 30542	Cinema and hospitality in a broad sense: how do films embody the art of welcoming, of hosting, of including and caring? Three months after his election in 2013, Pope Francis visited the Island of Lampedusa (Italy), one of the world’s deadliest forefronts of the humanitarian catastrophe often referred to as the global “refugee crisis.” He denounced the “globalization of indifference” in which no one wants to take responsibility for “our brothers and sisters” migrants who suffer and die. Ten years later, while the Pope is again addressing the “crisis” in Marseilles, in the month of August 2023 alone, 2,095 “migrants” have lost their lives in their attempts to cross the Mediterranean Ocean.   Through a general concept of “hospitality,” our class will offer a holistic, cinematic approach to a world scene in which an unprecedented number of individuals are forced to flee their homes. We will focus on the (extremely) old notion of hospitality (a decisively matrixial one) and analyze films that put this concept at their core both formally and narratively. One critical goal will be to explore the various cultural understandings and practices that forge the highly cultural, both idiosyncratic and universal art of inviting, including, unconditionally hosting, and caring for the guest, the stranger, the child, the unknown. An ideal of protection, empathy, and compassion without which there is no responsibility, no ethics, all concepts that are the cornerstone of a feminist ethics that will nourish our research.  This class will, in most parts, consist of seminar discussions and lectures.  Two written assignments, group work, oral presentations as well as active participation in our class will constitute the basic requirements.
FTT 30635	Long Title: Drunk on Film: The Psychology of Storytelling with Alcohol and Its Effects on Alcohol Consumption.     Alcohol Use Disorder is a chronic relapsing brain disease. But when presented on screen, it's entertainment. Why do we laugh, why do we cry, why do we emulate fictional characters whose drinking habits result in a life of debilitating addiction? From James Bond to Jonah Hill, the psychology and seduction of alcohol on film, television, and online will be analyzed.  Furthermore, what is the relationship between the manner in which alcohol use/abuse is presented on screen and the manner in which alcohol is used and abused on, for example, college campuses? Surveying recent film history, we will examine how alcohol is used in story structure, as a character flaw or strength, and as a narrative device in the story arc of films across multiple film genres, (action/adventure, comedy, romance, etc). Why do characters drink, where do they drink, and how does the result of their &quot;getting drunk&quot; advance the narrative? We'll also look at non-fiction films that tackle issues of addiction, as a way of comparing character development in Hollywood films to the results of this same behavior in everyday life. Film materials will include weekly screenings outside of class, and academic articles relating to portrayal and analysis of alcohol use in film and television, including the business of marketing alcohol in print and television advertising. From the psychological perspective we will discuss the topic and process of social influence and how the presence of others influences our behavior. Questions of interest will include the following: what are the mechanisms by which group influence unfolds? How and why might we be persuaded? Does the manner, and if so how, in which alcohol use is portrayed in movies and the media reflect the processes and principles of social influence? Readings will include chapters on social influence, persuasion and academic articles evaluating the manner in which alcohol is portrayed and advertised and the effect this has on alcohol consumption. In addition, issues of addiction will be discussed - from understanding the basis of addiction to examining the efficacy of addiction treatment.

FTT 35505	It's commonly said that there is no set path to a career in the media and entertainment industries the way there is a path to working in, say, accountancy, law, or medicine. But a more accurate description would be that there are many paths because there are so many different jobs one could pursue in film and television, and each can have multiple routes of getting there. There are also arguably more paths than ever before due to technological transformations in the entertainment industry, from digital distribution to DIY production, as well as more interconnected pathways to adjacent industries like music and gaming. But this in turn can make it even more challenging for students to understand not only what paths they can do down but even what jobs exist at the end of those paths and what interests and skills they call for.  This version of the Paths to the Entertainment Industry class will focus on specific jobs in media and entertainment and how they’re evolving in a time of instability and even crisis in some sectors of the industry. Guest speakers will explain their roles in the industry, outline how they’ve changed as the industry itself has transformed in recent years, and propose steps students can take today to join their ranks tomorrow. Students enrolled in the class will be charged with preparing questions for speakers, taking notes during speaker sessions, and adding to a database of Paths to the Entertainment Industry resources that is made available to future generations of students for career discernment and development.  Topics and job areas covered in the class may include: development, distribution, marketing, representation (agents and managers), live production, independent and studio production, production outside of LA and NYC, assistants, global media, AI, animation, acting, gaming, music, and brand partnerships.

Departmental Approval is needed to register for this course.
FTT 40028	Camp. as an adjective, goes back at least to 1909. In its oldest sense, it was defined as &quot;addicted to actions and gestures of exaggerated emphasis, pleasantly ostentatious, or in manner affected.” But from 1920, in theatrical argot, camp connoted homosexual or lesbian and was in general use with that meaning by 1945. In 1964, Susan Sontag's famous &quot;Notes on Camp&quot; defined camp as a failed seriousness, a love of exaggeration and artifice, the privileging of style over content, and being alive to the double sense in which some things can be taken. Sontag aligned camp especially with gay male taste. Camp can be seen both as a mode of performance – camping it up-- and as a way of seeing things and spectatorship – camp as being in the eye of the beholder. This class will consider theories of camp by Sontag and others; camp performance by Mae West, Judy Garland, Madonna, and others; camp spectatorship of horror films, musicals, and more. WE will consider gay male camp, feminist camp, lesbian camp, the mainstreaming of camp, and the meaning of camp today.  This is a one credit course that can be taken as satisfactory/unsatisfactory or for a standard letter grade. Course will meet one day a week for 8 weeks.
FTT 40040	Be in the room where it happens! Creating Theatre and Film as Social Action will prepare students to transform ideas, encounters, and convictions into vivid performative texts.  Performers, writers, artists, composers and bold thinkers of kinds will investigate and apply techniques that have created some of the most exciting productions of the current decade as they devise and perform both solo and company-generated productions. Exercises and discussions lay the foundation for creative work as students experience the process of generating text, action, and image from initial inspiration to live performance or film.  The class engages both the analytical and impulsive mind in world-building and storytelling as it explores diverse forms of expression.  For the final project, students are expected to create a video essay, a multi-disciplinary performance, or a hitherto unseen new experience or happening.
FTT 40121	This workshop focuses on the theory and craft of dramatic writing as it applies to feature screenplays.  Through lectures, film viewing, and weekly exercises, emphasis is placed on plot and story structure, the adaptation of ideas into cinematic forms, how to tell a story with images, character, plot, and dialogue development.  Students should come to class with 2 ideas for a feature script in hand and be prepared to develop one idea into the first half of a feature length screenplay (approximately 60 pages) at a minimum. 
FTT 40125	This workshop focuses on the theory and craft of comedic writing as it applies to original half-hour screenplays.

Students will explore classic half-hour comedy pilots (script and screen) with an eye towards identifying and evolving the concepts of comedic character development and story arcs. Students should come to class with an expectation to write frequently and collaboratively in order to create two original half-hour television episode scripts.
FTT 40130	Course Description: Asian theatre- and film-makers have produced some of the most innovative and exciting versions of Shakespeare's work. His strong presence in Asia also speaks to the histories and legacies of colonization and cultural imperialism. This course explores several well-known Shakespearean plays through the lens of Asian adaptation, rooted in both close reading of the plays themselves and the historical-cultural contexts of their adaptations. How, when, and why have specific Shakespearean plays captured the imaginations of Asian theatre artists and filmmakers? How have they transformed Shakepearean texts through translation, the use of local performance forms, new geographic and historical settings, and other techniques? How do these reimaginings rethink what &quot;Shakespeare&quot; might mean? By exploring such questions, students will gain a deeper understanding of Shakespeare, Asian theatre, and the complexities of their conjoining.
FTT 40257	Over the past decade, network television producers have reimagined the situation comedy with great success by utilizing mockumentary film techniques. This course will examine the ever-changing boundaries between fiction and non-fiction film and television by analyzing a series of works which question these discrete categorizations.  We will consider canonical examples of documentary and the challenges posed to these known forms by pseudodocumentary and other media which reveal the devices used to establish cinematic realism. We will also explore a selection of film and television work which ascribes to realist modes of representation while subverting this approach. Issues such as testimony, performance, reflexivity, and ethics will be addressed in an effort to deepen the complex discourse of realism in visual media. 
FTT 40405	A film director is first and foremost a visual thinker, who translates a script onto the screen through the language of cinema. In this course, we will learn how to use this language and organize its syntax and grammar to tell a story. We will focus on the meaning of a shot as a singular capsule of cinematic time and space in service of the script. We will learn how to use shot progression in order to build a scene. And we will explore the methods of connecting scenes into a cumulative cinematic experience. This process involves conceptualizing a film from pre-production to post-production from the point of view of a director. Therefore, in addition to theories of directing, this course will include hands-on exercises that focus on preparing a film using various tools like a shotlist, storyboard, floorpan, lined script, visual references, color palettes, and notes for actors. We will learn how to analyze and break down a scene in order to answer the eternal question on every director's mind - how do I know where to put the camera? This course will help you understand your role as a film director and build your confidence at every stage of filmmaking. Filmmaking is a highly industrial process that involves technical expertise in lighting, grip, and camera. However, building on this knowledge, we must understand how to use these technical skills in order to tell an emotional story in any genre. As such, this course will complement the knowledge you will gain in introductory and intermediate filmmaking classes.
FTT 40410	Through hands-­on, field experience and critical analysis, we will explore the tools and techniques used to produce professional video and digital cinema projects in all genres.  We will explore the use of composition, cinematography, color and editing to create a narrative structure. This class will also provide you with a technical knowledge of the tools required in professional filmmaking including a variety of lighting and grip equipment, lenses, filters, light meters, etc.  Using RED Digital Cinema RED Raven 4K cameras and various support tools you will produce, shoot and edit short projects or &quot;challenges&quot; including your final short 3-5min film.  This will be a non-­‐dialogue driven film based with a post-­‐produced soundtrack. No other digital formats are to be used outside of what we utilize for this class.  We will also discuss various filmmaking techniques and current industry topics, including film in relation to digital cinema and current  workflows.  Post Production will be done using Davinci Resolve.
FTT 40426	What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films. Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba).
FTT 40453	Adaptation is designed to engage students in exploring playwriting and screenwriting approaches to adapt existing texts (i.e. historical or contemporary fiction and non-fiction). The course will delve into analyzing adaptations in theatre, film and television with the aim to present a variety of paths toward creating new, vibrant plays, screenplays and teleplays. Culminating projects will include several short adaptation scripts and the start of a full-length adaptation. Adaptation is for students who have completed at least one playwriting or screenwriting course.
FTT 40502	This course focuses on critical analyses of identities in media culture.  Taking a cultural studies approach, we will interrogate theories and popular discourses of identity while exploring how particular identities are constructed, negotiated, resisted, and transformed within media culture.  Our primary questions in this course are: What is identity?  How do our identities inform our various relationships to media culture?  And, how does media culture impact the construction of our identities?  Our particular sites of analysis will be media representation (narrative, performance, aesthetics), media production (industries and political economy), and media consumption (reception practices and audiences). We will examine a broad array of media forms, including film, television, the Internet, games, and popular music.  Traditional demographic identities, such as gender, age, race, sexuality, and class, will be central to the course, although other identities, including geographic and lifestyle identities, will be examined also.  We will strive toward critical analyses that understand identities as constructed, not inherent, and intersectional, not autonomous.
FTT 40604	This is an introductory course to directing actors for film and TV. You will acquire various tools and methods of directing to create authentic and nuanced performances for the camera. You will learn how to work and communicate with actors to get the best, most believable acting on screen; how to stage and choreograph blocking with regards to camera and how to react and fix problems in a fast and efficient way on set. As such, you will have an opportunity to be both in front of and behind the camera to better understand the specificities and requirements of on-camera acting. You will get a chance to direct scenes of various complexity to practice these tools in a simulated set environment. 
FTT 40621	Wherever we place it in the pantheon of great plays  and in spite of Tolstoy's loathing of it, King Lear is a very extraordinary play. This course will explore its extraordinariness by concentrating on it unremittingly. It will do so in two steps. For the first half of the semester we will slow-read the play together, thinking about anything and, insofar as we can, everything that it provokes us to investigate, from Shakespeare's sources to early stagings and revisions, from its views on power, gender and the spiritual to its verse and vocabulary, and so on and on. In the second half of the semester we will engage with the play in performance and reimaginings through film versions and a variety of adaptations from Nahum Tate to Jane Smiley and beyond.
FTT 41257	Lab/Screening to 40257 Documentary: Fact or Fiction?
FTT 43160	This course will explore how music and sound have become central to modern multi-media. While our main focus will be on movies (ranging from classical to contemporary cinema, presented in mandatory weekly screenings), we will also explore the role of music and sound more broadly from advertisements to video-games; from music videos to TikTok clips; from ambient sound in retail spaces to personalized playlists. In doing so, readings will cover various topics and issues aesthetic and psychological (such as representation, narration, emotion); social and political (such as race, ethnicity, propaganda); cultural and economic (such as production, technology, dissemination), and music-analytical (such as style, syntax, harmony, topoi, genre). Course work will include discussion posts, position papers, and a capstone research project that may involve creative work.

FTT 60040	Theatre and Film as Social Action will prepare students to transform moments of encounters - with daily objects, events in our lives, a secret story from a friend, or even a concept or intriguing idea - into performative texts or visual statements articulating urgent social and global issues. Students who are interested in creating performance pieces will learn how a text evolves from idea to theatre or performance art. Students who are interested in creating films will learn how an idea is transformed to text and in turn to a visual medium, through the aesthetics of framing, editing, sound mixing, and mise-en-scene. In the process, students will understand the aesthetic and stylistic components of both theatre and film narratives, and compare their creative processes and stylistic practices.Exercises and discussions will lay the foundation for the students' creative work. For the final project, students are expected to create either a video essay, a multi-disciplinary performance, a performance art, or a hitherto unseen new experience or happening.
FTT 60121	This workshop focuses on the theory and craft of dramatic writing as it applies to feature screenplays.

FTT 60320	It has long-been a part of Notre Dame's Saturday football tradition. As uniformed players leave the locker room and descend a tight stairwell to the field below, they reach up and touch the iconic &quot;Play Like a Champion Today&quot; sign. Countless players, students, and fans have touched the sign over the years, hoping to imbibe some illusive and ineffable Fighting Irish magic. But what does it mean to &quot;play like a champion today&quot; ... or any day, really? More simply, what does it mean to play? Play is an inescapable and essential part of the human condition. And, yet, the experience's core liminality defies easy definition and explanation. This course provides an introduction to the study of human play primarily through the lens of analog and digital games. It is designed for first- and second-year students from a range of backgrounds and disciplines. Given the variety of play practices across human history and cultures, this class strives to equip students with a critical vocabulary and interpretive framework to help them make sense of play in its many forms. This class will pay particular attention to how rules, goals, game mechanics, and narratives offer reliable and compelling structures for gameplay, and what ludic activities reveal about social power.
FTT 60456	In this course, students will learn different theories, methods, and approaches to understanding and writing about screen cultures. We will explore approaches that consider aesthetics/style, narrative, authorship (directors, show runners, stars), genre (e.g. the musical, horror), history (history of film/media industries, history of visual spectacle, historical context for films/media, etc.), technologies (sound, color, digital technologies, etc.), identities (considerations of gender, sexuality, race, nation, age, etc.), and audience (reception, fandom). Students will: Read theories that articulate and advocate each approach; consider the parameters, value, and appeal of that approach, as well as its limitations; practice each approach in written exercises; and research and write a final paper using one or more of these approaches. Students may also use video essays or other media as tools of analysis and critique. This is a course in academic criticism, not journalistic reviewing. Strong emphasis will be placed on argumentative writing.
FTT 60502	This course focuses on critical analyses of identities in media culture.  Taking a cultural studies approach, we will interrogate theories and popular discourses of identity while exploring how particular identities are constructed, negotiated, resisted, and transformed within media culture.

FTT 60890	&quot;How do the contemporary film and television industries work? How can an analysis of the &quot;business of entertainment&quot; enable a greater understanding of contemporary media aesthetics and culture? This course will explore these questions by focusing on the structure, practices and products of America's film and television industries, and students will engage with academic readings, screenings, trade publications, current events, guest lectures, and written and oral assignments in order to understand the activities of the film and television industries. By the end of the course, students should be able to understand prominent practices employed by media conglomerates today; recognize the ways in which industrial structures and practices can shape media products; examine how television shows and movies are influenced by business strategies; and identify the potential impact that the media industries have on creativity, culture, and society. The course should be especially beneficial for students intending to pursue scholarly or professional careers related to film and television through its comprehensive overview of how these industries work, why they work as they do, and the broader practical and theoretical implications of media industry operations.&quot;
FTT 61006	This course is designed to introduce students to creating original work for the theater. The course will explore the writing process as well as models from contemporary U.S. theater with the aim to present a variety of paths toward creating new, vibrant plays. This is primarily a writing course. In addition, by reading and discussing ten separate dynamic play texts, we will analyze dramatic writing. Weekly writing exercises, movement work, visual arts approaches, improvisation techniques and collaborative discussions will create resources for rich play material, which each student will eventually use in a final scene, presented in a public reading at the end of the semester.

Through these conversations, the course inspires you to cultivate, in the words of the Notre Dame Mission Statement, the &quot;disciplined habits of mind, body, and spirit that are characteristic of educated, skilled, and free human beings.&quot;   Animated by Notre Dame's vision of Catholic education, the course believes that personal development is pursued in the context of community in which diverse perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds converge to heal, unify, enlighten, and transform the world. Through the gifts of each person, you are invited to engage with practices of defining, discerning, and developing a vision of a life well-lived.  The two-semester course sequence challenges you to individually encounter and respond to the invitation of personal development. In the spring, the FYS 10102 course equips you to apply a deepened level of self-knowledge to meet the following objectives: discern possible ways of living life and develop and pursue a vision of a life well-lived.
FYS 10405	Recognizing the fundamental importance of qualified teachers in the unique experiment that is American education, this course explores the connection between strong students and strong teachers. The impetus behind this one-credit class is a practical one: American society needs more of its brightest young minds participating in education beyond their own years as a student. While at its core a discernment tool for First Year students of all major intents considering teaching as a vocation, the lectures and discussions will also preview opportunities for individuals external to the profession to positively impact education in their communities. Topics of study will include: the history of teachers in the United States compared with other industrialized societies, teaching as a vocation/profession, a portrait of elementary and secondary teachers today, where the profession is headed, the importance of intellectually-gifted persons working as teachers at all levels, post-graduate service opportunities in teaching, transition to teaching programs and professional opportunities for students without a degree in education, and the importance of community engagement in education. NOTE: This course begins after mid-term break.
FYS 10421	Intended primarily for first-year students enrolling for the first time in the Spring or Summer terms, this course creates space for active discussion and reflection regarding the academic, social, and extracurricular components of a successful transition into Notre Dame. While providing an introduction to a network of campus resources, we will also investigate ideas related to resilience and one's ability to thrive in a challenging academic environment. Topics will include self-efficacy, communication, community responsibility, and self-awareness/evaluation, among others. Assignments will include reading, reflective writing, and class participation and presentation.
FYS 10423	This interdisciplinary one-credit course is the second of two related courses (Introduction to Global Arts and Identity I and Introduction to Global Arts and Identity II). Students may choose to take either course and/or both courses.  The courses do not need to be taken in order.   Introduction to Global Arts and Identity II is designed to introduce students to the arts as a sophisticated means of communicating personal and social values and understandings of identity.  Identity (both self-created and imposed from without) is a major concern of artistic disciplines from across the globe. Topics covered will include selected aspects of West African, Chinese, and North American arts. Students will complete the course with the skills necessary to approach art forms and cultures new to them with increased confidence and with an appreciation for the brilliant and complicated way in which values and identity are reflected in art from across the world and across disciplines.
FYS 10900	The Scholarly Engagement Seminar is a sequence of two half-semester courses designed to provide in-depth resources to sophomores in the first year of the Flatley Center for Undergraduate Scholarly Engagement's (CUSE's) Sorin Scholars program. Topics covered in the course include scholarly discernment, developing a relationship with a faculty mentor, applying for funding for independent summer projects, presenting at national conferences, using scholarship to make a difference, considering options for graduate and professional school, and applying for competitive national fellowships. There will be a number of guest presenters, including other CUSE staff, junior and senior Sorin Scholars, notable alumni, Notre Dame faculty, and staff from other units whose work relates to scholarly engagement. By the end of the course, students should have the ability to produce a strong draft of an application for funding for a summer project and a compelling draft of an application for a national fellowship.

GE 23620	Over the last decade or so, there has been a new and prominent wave of &quot;New Atheism,&quot; often promoted in popular books that reach a wide and, apparently, appreciative audience.  Yet, atheism is as old as religion itself, and in the Western tradition has roots that extend into the earliest recorded history.  In this class we will consider atheism on its own merits - its arguments, values, and intentions - but also as a historical phenomenon, tracing its original expressions and especially its rise during the &quot;modern&quot; period beginning in the 17th and 18th centuries.  We will thus focus on Spinoza, Hume, d'Holback, Ludwig Feuerbach, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and among the &quot;New Atheists&quot; Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchins. This course will be taught in English.
GE 30112	Germany is globally recognized as a leader in the fields of renewable energy, sustainable development, and environmental protection. But how did this come about? In this course, we will examine the roles that culture and history play in shaping human attitudes towards the environment. Our case studies will range over two centuries, from damming projects in the Rhine valley at the start of the nineteenth century to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster at the end of the twentieth. We will study novels, films, and philosophical essays alongside works by leading environmental historians. Over the course of the semester, students will develop a richer understanding of German environmentalism that also includes an awareness of its dark sides, such as the role that nature conservancy played within Nazi ideology. This course will be taught in English.
GE 30304	This course offers an overview of major developments in the literary and cultural history of German-speaking Europe. The course explores significant figures and works of literature, the visual arts, music, and philosophy as well as their interrelationship and historical contextualization.

GE 33000	In this special course designed for inquisitive international economics / romance language majors, students will attend a number of lectures, panels, and seminars on campus during the semester, with a follow-up discussion for each led by either a visitor or a member of the economics or romance languages faculty. Before each session, students will be expected to complete a short reading assignment. At each follow-up session, the students will submit a 1-2 page summary and analysis of the talk, with a critical question for discussion. The goal is to encourage students to enrich their major experience by participating in the intellectual discussions that occur amongst ND and visiting scholars across the campus, distinguished alumni, and professionals in the field. 
GE 33027	As soon as Europeans began exploring and colonizing the so-called New World, Germans were there. Germans came to the Americas as conquistadors, settlers, refugees, missionaries, and merchants. The German colony in Venezuela was disastrously short-lived, but Germans came to play a significant role in the colonization of North America through the settlement of Pennsylvania. This course introduces students to the varieties of German presence in the Americas from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Topics may include the colonization and conquest of South America, German interactions with Indigenous communities, German missionaries to the enslaved peoples in the Caribbean, the role of German immigrants in early anti-slavery and pacifist movements, and the origin and afterlife of the language called Pennsylvania Dutch. This course will be taught in English. 
GE 43204	How can we work for a more just world? Major works of German film and literature insightfully depict a variety of paradigmatic scenarios of social injustice, suggesting ways these conditions might be ameliorated and perhaps even overcome. Topics include: misogyny; child-murder; prostitution; poverty; workers’ rights; just distribution of resources; wealth and income inequality; the status of minority, migrant and refugee populations; religion and the state (Jewish emancipation and oppression); and the individual’s striving for freedom within an authoritarian regime. This upper-level course taught in German, surveys major works of German literature and film from the 18th to the 21st centuries that prominently engage themes of social engagement.
GE 48498	Spring semester course for the 2-semester senior thesis in German Studies.  Students will receive a letter grade
GE 60102	An introductory course of the spoken and written language. Aims at the acquisition of basic structures, vocabulary, and sound systems. For students with no previous study of the language.
GH 20550	Over the last two decades, there has been a groundswell of interest in global health across multiple disciplines and professional fields. The field of global health recognizes the multidimensionality of health as well as the interconnectedness of everyone living in the world today; its primary goal is to eliminate health disparities to achieve health equity for all. This course will provide foundational knowledge necessary to understand what global health is today; its history and evolution; how social theory contributes to understanding specific global health problems; the importance of understanding health and designing interventions by using a biosocial model that includes a myriad of cultural, social, political, economic factors; and an understanding of the role of various actors on the global health stage including international, bilateral, and civil society organizations.
GH 20600	Epidemiology is a flexible and powerful field of study for anyone with an interest in understanding, preventing, and treating the causes of human disease. This course will facilitate students' understanding of fundamental epidemiological concepts (e.g. terminology, calculations, etc.); methods (e.g. study designs, risk communication, etc.); and applications (e.g. screening, diseases surveillance, and outbreak investigations). Students will also learn the application of epidemiological methods to nutritional, infectious disease, and chronic disease epidemiology.
GH 23550	There has been a groundswell of interest in global health across multiple disciplines and students have been participating in many kinds of health-related field work.  Some students find that they are unprepared for the challenges they face in the field. In addition, there has been a tendency to focus on student learning at the expense of host community needs, resulting in the exacerbation of inequalities and the increased potential for harm to that community. However, experiential learning can be designed such that it brings value to both the host community and the student. This course will provide preliminary preparation for strategically and ethically carrying out health-related fieldwork. Students will be introduced to tools for enabling meaningful fieldwork experiences that increase their understanding of global health problems and recognition of contextual challenges, strengths, and priorities. 
GH 30700	With an increasing number of complex domestic and international health challenges, the need for clear, effective, and timely health communication has become more apparent. This course will provide an overview of communication concepts and strategies that can shape health practices and promote public health goals. Students will become familiar with theories, communication channels, and some factors to consider in the design and analysis of persuasive health communication materials.
GH 60207	Global health is an area of study, research and practice that focuses on achieving equity in health for all people worldwide. The health status of individuals and populations arise from a myriad of complex biological, social, economic, political, and environmental factors that operate synergistically. Through a social justice lens, we will examine how these factors shape health outcomes and how interventions must be developed that include addressing the root causes of inequity. We will use a case-based approach, focusing on specific health problems in several countries, including the United States. Cases will include a variety of themes including health disparities arising from stress-associated racial discrimination, the epidemiological transition from infectious to non-communicable diseases, and how the health effects of climate change disproportionately affect the most vulnerable
GH 60408	Emphasis on physiology, genetics, and relationships of arthropods as agents and vectors of disease. Spring.
GH 60589	Epidemiology is a flexible and powerful field of study for anyone with an interest in understanding, preventing, and treating the causes of human disease. In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of causal inference and develop your abilities as a critical consumer and producer of scientific data. You will explore conceptual models of causality, study design, challenges of measurement, sources of bias, causal diagrams, data analysis and interpretation, prevention and assessment of confounding, interpretation of interaction/effect mediation, and evaluation of study validity and generalizability. In addition, you will be challenged to apply course concepts to the interpretation of real-world examples of scientific publications and reports. Finally, you will develop capacity for designing and completing your own research projects, for both the capstone project and other future endeavors.
GH 60598	This is the foundational course for Master of Science in Global Health students. It is intended to give students an overview of the key topics, activities, goals and challenges that comprise the global health enterprise. The course will be very forward-looking with respect to understanding the goals of the global health community in the context of: global partnerships, governance and leadership; health equity and social justice; approaches to problem-solving; ethical reasoning; systems thinking; and personal, social, economic and environmental determinants of health. On completion of the course, students will understand the major goals and challenges related achieving health with a focus on the poorest and most marginalized in the context of the complex determinants of health. Students will have the skills to analyze and think critically in tackling problems in global health.
GH 60599	This course examines current health policy issues and disease burdens in low-and middle-income countries from an economic perspective. Topics may vary but are likely to include the relationship between health and economic development, child and maternal health, the need for financial risk protection against health shocks, social determinants of health inequities, the control of malaria, the relationship between fetal and early-child conditions on human capital, and other related topics. There will be a strong focus on interpreting the relevant empirical literature. The course will approach these issues from a microeconomics perspective and will analyze economic behavior at the micro-level i.e. individual and household. The course will also discuss program evaluation techniques to understand which health policy works in the real-world.
GH 60614	The goal of this course is to provide students with a working knowledge of study design, questionnaire development, survey research and a variety of the most commonly used statistical methods and tools in Epidemiology and Global Health. Students will learn how to design research projects and analyze data in health-related problem situations using various statistical methods, allowing them to arrive at better conclusions that are supported by sound statistical methodologies. Students will learn to apply analytic methods such as Survival Analysis, Logistic Regression, Cox Regression, methods of calculation of appropriate sample size and other statistical methods. Ultimately, students will develop a more discerning approach to the consumption of statistical reports, particularly in health science.
GH 60620	This introductory course will build foundational knowledge of leadership theory and discovery.  Students will study theories and frameworks of leadership while engaging in self-discovery to understand their own leadership preferences, values, and styles as well as the importance of understanding the leadership styles of their peers. We will also explore how the different leadership styles may serve as assets or hindrances.  The course is structured to be interactive and engaging which will include lectures, in-class exercises, and class discussion. Emphasis will be placed on how students apply the coursework to case studies grounded in global health issues.
GH 60700	With an increasing number of complex domestic and international health challenges, the need for clear, effective, and timely health communication has become more apparent. This course will provide an overview of communication concepts and strategies that can shape health practices and promote public health goals. Students will become familiar with theories, communication channels, and some factors to consider in the design and analysis of persuasive health communication materials.
GH 60761	Global Affairs organizations often manage their work through projects, and project managers are consequently in high demand in the global affairs career marketplace. Project managers write project proposals, design projects, develop project plans, implement project activities, monitor project progress, and evaluate project impact. The PDME course will focus on building these competencies at the project and program levels and will be structured around three existing models: 1) PMD-Pro, an internationally-recognized competency model in global development that also offers a third-party examination and certification; 2) CRS Compass, a model developed by Catholic Relief Services for all global programming that encompasses ideas of Integral Human Development; and 3) MEALD-Pro, similar to PMD-Pro, but with a focus on program monitoring and evaluation.
GH 61408	The laboratory introduces students to the variety of arthropods that vector disease agents or otherwise affect the lives of humans and other vertebrate animals. 
GH 68554	The Capstone Seminar is required for all MS in Global Health students. The capstone courses span the entire year and are designed to support students as they prepare for and complete their Capstone Project as required in the MS in Global Health program. This semester's course lays the foundation for the Capstone Project and guides students as they develop their project focus. We will discuss program requirements and deadlines with regard to your Capstone Project, including the field research component. There is a focus on scientific writing and students will submit a project proposal to an evaluation committee at the end of the semester. Students are responsible for working with an identified faculty supervisor on their projects during the semester to advance the project and meet all deadlines.
GH 68559	Capstone Seminar IV provides the foundation for the Capstone Field Research Project and supports students as they develop a research project in consultation with their Capstone Supervisor and Capstone Committee. The final course focuses on strengthening students’ skills and developing their familiarity with common methods of scientific communication.
GLAF 10001	This course provides an overview of the broad and loosely related field(s) of study and expertise typically clustered under the term &quot;global affairs&quot; and explores Notre Dame's particular approach to global issues, namely &quot;integral human development&quot; (IHD). IHD is a conceptual and normative framework for understanding, practicing, and evaluating efforts to reduce poverty, build peace, protect human rights, and address crises caused by food shortages, natural disasters, environmental degradation, and exploitative government or corporate practices and policies. This course examines the provenance, meanings, and resonances of integral human development and comparable concepts in multiple religious as well as secular traditions.
GLAF 20001	Global Policy &amp; Politics (GPP) helps students gain an understanding of the influences and challenges officials face during the foreign policymaking process. The course begins by investigating how people's choices are shaped by cognitive, cultural, normative and decision-making structures. The second section of the course examines how a state's attributes (i.e., size, regime type, and internal cohesion) produce different types of constraints on policymakers. The third portion looks at the most important actors in the foreign policymaking process in the United States, including the president, intelligence, the Congress, media, NGOs, international institutions, foreign governments, and lobbyists. In the fourth segment we examine policymaking in a half-dozen countries. Using a comparative approach, we identify the characteristics of each county and study their real-world effects on its foreign policies. The final is an experiential learning simulation in which students apply their skills and knowledge to a crisis situation based on actual events. In addition to studying policymaking, students will also learn how to consume, digest, and organize complex ideas and information across multiple related topics and explain them in a coherent manner. The course both enhances students' knowledge of how foreign policy is made and teaches them the reading, writing and oral communications skills they will need to support, and one day become, a policymaker. This includes producing both written and oral policy briefings as well as collaborative experiential policymaking exercises. The ability to find the logical linkages among arguments and synthesize and present their similarities and differences in concise and informative written and spoken briefings is a highly marketable skill. Multinational corporations, governments, think-tanks, NGOs and international organizations are all seeking people who are able to weigh different policy options and communicate complex analytical ideas to both superiors and subordinates.
GLAF 20101	When India gained independence from British Rule in 1947, democracy was not expected to last in the heterogeneous and poor sub-continent. Yet, democracy has thrived in India for over 70 years. More recently, other South Asian countries have democratized. What explains this unexpected trend? Is there a connection between colonial legacies, international institutions and South Asian democratization successes (and failures)? After an overview of caste, religion and language in the region, this course explores South Asian politics by examining the historical and institutional development of democracy in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, including internal and external threats to democratic institutions. In particular, we will examine how the politics of accommodation and good institutional design have affected the persistence of democracy on the sub-continent, while also considering how non-state actors and international organizations have impacted outcomes. The course also takes a deep look at the degree to which findings from South Asia might be used in other parts of the world and relevant policy implications.
GLAF 20105	Understanding religious communities and their values are crucial to understanding human societies and global affairs. One particular group of interpreters of Islam, namely the traditional or orthodox religious scholars called the ulama and their institutions, are often hidden from contemporary accounts of Islam when in fact they are critical players. This course will provide historical contexts in order to explore how traditional Muslims navigate the discourses of modernity and how they resist it. We will read original texts in translation and secondary sources of descriptions of representatives of the orthodox tradition in regions of Asia, the Middle East and in the West. The course will pay particular attention to the institutions of learning known as madrasas, jami` and hawzas. Of course, the orthodox views are challenged by other Muslims and some of those debates will also be channeled in the class while the focus will remain on the Ulama. The course aims to equip students with analytical skills and the resources to understand how religious ideas impact religious communities and global affairs.
GLAF 20106	An introduction to the field of international development, with particular focus on the various disciplines that have contributed to and shaped the development discourse. Readings, lectures, and discussions will draw from various disciplines, including economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, environmental and technological sciences, public health, law, and gender studies, among others. We will examine debates on the meaning and measurement of development; alternative approaches to, and methods in, the study of development; and attempts to address some of the main development challenges facing the world today. There will be a central focus on understanding &quot;what works&quot; in development. Working together in teams, students will conceptualize and design an international development project using &quot;real world&quot; constraints.
GLAF 20107	Armed conflict and state repression continue to occur across the globe, millions of people face overwhelming poverty, and systemic challenges like climate change imperil collective survival. Nevertheless, we have also witnessed the emergence of sophisticated civil society networks and social movements to address these challenges, as well as governmental and transnational institutions committed to promoting justice and peace at the local, national, regional and global levels. This course introduces students to the various ways scholars and activists define peace and the challenges faced in securing peace. It surveys: (1) the major causes of direct and structural violence; (2) various definitions of &quot;peace&quot; and the conditions under which it occurs and is sustained; and (3) the comparative success of various strategies such as building peace movements and promoting nonviolent social change.
GLAF 20109	"What does it mean to be Korean? How are definitions of Korea and “Koreanness” affected by recent waves of globalization and migration? This course investigates the social construction of race and nationhood within the context of South Korea. While many believe South Korea to be ethnically and racially homogeneous, the country has increasingly opened up its borders to foreign migration to offset the adverse impact of its rapidly aging society. More than one in ten marriages in South Korea involves a foreign-born person today, and growing numbers of racially mixed people consider themselves Korean. In addition, members of the Korean diaspora have started to “return” to their country of origin in recent years, only to find that they are marginalized because of their culturally different backgrounds. This course introduces students to sociological theories of race, ethnicity, and nationhood by analyzing how South Koreans define self and Other. We will learn how racial and ethnic identities continue to evolve as the contexts of migration change. We will also learn why it is difficult for individuals of particular backgrounds to find a sense of belonging in the societies in which they live and work.							"
GLAF 30106	The course will examine U.S. policies and practices to combat human trafficking including how U.S. policies advance the prevention of trafficking in persons, the protection of victims and survivors and the punishment of perpetrators as a foreign policy objective of the U.S. Students will develop a basic understanding of the various aspects of and perspectives in human trafficking including domestic and international law; foreign nationals and United States Citizens; victim services, survivor aftercare and law enforcement and sex and labor trafficking. Students will also analyze international trafficking prohibitions under the various international conventions and identify current trafficking issues in the United States, with a particular focus on commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor and involuntary servitude and the range of remedies available when rights have been violated. Finally, students will identify gaps in existing remedies and formulate policies to address them.
GLAF 30107	The application of artificial intelligence is expanding rapidly and has the potential to reshape many fields, including transportation, finance, health care, marketing, social media, criminal justice, and public policy, just to name a few. AI's ability to predict human preference and behavior or even substitute human judgement in these fields creates opportunities as well as concerns for safety, bias and discrimination, transparency, inequality, and job loss. Designed to serve students from no background in AI to those who have existing technical background, this course surveys current and emerging applications of AI in different fields and the related ethical issues and governance problems. The course targets students from different disciplines. Students from the humanities and social sciences will gain a deeper understanding of the technical aspects underpinning today's ethical and policy debates related to AI. Students with more technical background will better appreciate the ethical issues that arise in programming and engineering and understand how technology interacts with the broader societal contexts. The course's goal is to encourage students to become proactive in thinking of the societal implications of technological change and to incorporate such understanding in their education and careers.
GLAF 30109	The foundation of this course is a standard international economics syllabus, which assumes a principles or a micro- and macroeconomics course as prerequisite and covers international trade (comparative advantage, trade and income distribution, economics of scale, migration, etc.), international finance (balance of payments, exchange rates, monetary policy, and flows of financial and human capital), and the institutions of the global economy. In addition, the course will connect these issues with real-world cases and settings.
GLAF 30113	Social Entrepreneurship has sparked dialogue and debate for two decades. Its very definition is much debated, as well as its capacity to create sustainable, scalable, systems-changing impact. This course explores the theoretical concepts, practices and strategies associated with the dynamic discipline of social enterprise and innovation. For our purposes, social entrepreneurship is the landscape, of which paradigm-shifting solutions like microfinance, MSME (Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise) development, bottom of the pyramid, fair trade, impact investing, and the like, are components. This course will study many of these concepts, focusing on their opportunity for social impact, and as a vehicle for wealth creation in vulnerable and disenfranchised communities across the globe. Further, the course covers examples of various social enterprise models (for-profit, non-profit, hybrid), requiring students to analyze and devise strategies to improve the efficacy of these ventures. Finally, the course engages students in research seeking to advance the field of social entrepreneurship at the Keough School of Global Affairs and Notre Dame.
GLAF 30116	Civil Rights in the US is a living tradition that students can both understand and engage with. This course traces the non-linear, contested and ongoing history of Civil Rights in the US from the founding period to the present. It employs the perspectives of a lawyer and historian to illustrate how: the Civil War and the end of slavery made Civil Rights in the US possible, international human rights and Civil Rights in the US have interacted over time; the complicated relationship between the definition of Civil Rights and the realization of these rights played out over time, and the tensions between the federal government and the states continue to shape Civil Rights down to the present. The course is structured around three key historical periods in which Civil Rights in the US developed and the divisive legacy of these periods of possibility: The Founding and Constitutional period 1776-1790, Civil War and Reconstruction, 1863-1883 and the Civil Rights Era 1945-1991. Through an examination of social movements, Supreme Court cases, and congressional action the course illustrates how the meaning of citizenship and civil rights, who constituted a citizen, and what institutions—state and local government, private individuals, and so on—posed the biggest threat to equal treatment under the law changed over time. Finally, the course provides opportunities for students to actively participate in the US Civil Rights tradition.
GLAF 30117	We live in a fully engineered world. What we eat, what we wear, where and how we live, the ways we entertain ourselves, the air we breath and the very ground we walk on are all the product of engineering. The profession of engineering emerged from modest beginnings to global prominence: in the twentieth century engineers came to design, implement, and manage nearly all elements of the modern world from their positions within corporations and government bureaucracies. Engineering is embedded in histories of capitalism, development, the environment, and human welfare. We examine the work of engineers in the United States and Europe as well as in places such as China, India, Mexico, Chile, and elsewhere. Students will develop a research project on a topic in this history, using archival and/or digitized sources. No background in history or engineering is required.
GLAF 30118	Fracking, Water Wars, Deforestation of the Amazon, Droughts, Global Warming, Climate Change, Unsustainable Agriculture, Hurricanes, Pollution, Species Extinction, Invasive Species, Poaching, Overfishing, Depletion of Fossil Fuels, Overpopulation, Wastes, Ocean Acidification, Wildfires, Oil Spills, Overpopulation, Overconsumption, Land degradation —the list goes on!  These complex environmental problems are occurring constantly and rapidly; their consequences are global in scope and transcend national boundaries; and they embody the complex relationship between humans and the natural environment. This course is about developing an interdisciplinary understanding of the relationship between humans (society) and the environment. We will examine the historical and contemporary environmental challenges of global concern, the underlying role of humans, and attempts by society to address, mitigate, and adapt to such complex problems through policies, institutions, and governance. We will pay attention to the roles of different state and non-state actors in environmental policy making. Overall, students will draw from both the social and natural sciences to develop a deeper understanding of how society—through consumption, culture, politics, power, ethics, values, economic growth, location, etc— contribute to, or solve, environmental problems.
GLAF 30119	In a religiously diverse and vastly troubled world, how do religious traditions motivate believers to work toward the common good? &quot;Engaging World Religions,&quot; the course title, refers to three things we will examine. First, it describes how religions are intrinsically engaging: they draw in adherents by fulfilling their material, intellectual, and spiritual needs. Second, it specifies what various secular institutions like governments and development organizations must do in pursuing the common good across our planet -- most of whose inhabitants are religious. Finally, it characterizes our work in this class: exploring how various religious traditions conceptualize and work toward the common good in a global context. We will read historians, social scientists, philosophers, and critical theorists on how to analyze and interpret the role of religion in contemporary life, while examining case studies of how religious practices, beliefs, and identities intersect with issues in global affairs such as inequality, armed conflict, and climate change. In doing so, we will engage how religious traditions from the East and West -- from Asian and Abrahamic &quot;world&quot; religions, to a variety of indigenous &quot;local&quot; religions -- complicate or complement modern Catholicism's emphasis on Integral Human Development.
GLAF 30121	This course introduces the role of economics in environmental issues and in the formation of environmental policy. Topics covered include choice, externalities, market failure, cost-benefit and environmental valuation analyses, and climate change. The course aims to encourage students to think about pressing environmental issues in economic terms and equip students with the diverse set of economics tools to contribute to the evaluation and implementation of wise policy choices. There is no prior knowledge of economics required, and students will have the opportunity to learn basic economic principles and frameworks that guide decision-making regarding environmental issues.
GLAF 30122	This class analyzes the politics and cultures of remembrance in Europe from the late nineteenth century to today. Taking examples such as the politicization of Holocaust memory in Europe or the grassroots removal of monuments in Britain as points of departure, students will learn about processes of remembering and forgetting, and how memories of the past have shaped European identity and culture in the 20th and 21st centuries. We will pay particular attention to the mobilization and commemoration of Europe's traumatic pasts, including the World Wars, imperialism and decolonization, the Cold War, and histories of genocide, to investigate how Europeans have remembered these difficult histories and how these memories have shifted over time. We will look not only at how the traumatic past is represented today; but how memory work was enacted at the time and how Europeans have fought to revise these representations and demand new recognition of alternative visions of the past. In its focus on memory, broadly defined, this course will deeply explore how representations of the past have shaped European identity, culture, and politics both at the time and today. In its focus on memory and memorialization, this class also attends to the visuality and material culture of history and historical research. Students will learn to read visual and material sources as sources akin to political tracts, diaries, and memoirs. We will engage with sources including photo albums, monuments, memorials, museum spaces, memorial landscapes, film, cultural kitsch, and art all as critical primary sources to understanding the production and circulation of memory. We will read foundational texts on collective memory and remembrance to understand how scholars and theorists have defined and conceptualized memory. Students will also conduct an original research project on a topic of their choosing by exploring a case study of memory work or collective memory in the context of Modern Europe.
GLAF 30126	Many people predict that the 21st century will be the &quot;Asian Century,&quot; dominated by China, India, and other nation-states on the continent. What does it mean to imagine an Asian future? In this class, we answer this question by rethinking connections between past, present, and future, both within and between different nations in Asia. How can we better understand the global connections between past and present if we take Asia, rather than Europe and North America, as our starting point? By contextualizing contemporary issues in Asia within global social and historical context, students will learn to move beyond common stereotypes about the region. We will use materials from history, anthropology, religion, and literature to explore the impacts of colonialism, nationalism, and globalization on everyday life across the continent. Through this course, students will learn how to analyze the intersections of personal, local, regional, and global contexts in order to better explain how Asia shapes our world. All majors and backgrounds are welcome. No prior knowledge about Asian languages or topics is required.
GLAF 30127	Are human rights modern inventions or are they as old as humankind? Are they universal or culturally specific? How much progress, if any, has transnational human rights advocacy achieved? How and to what extent should human rights influence foreign policy? What are the advantages and disadvantages of encoding human rights in international law? By examining these and similar questions, this course initiates students in the study of international human rights. In addition to informative readings, intriguing podcasts, and interactive lectures the course features in-class debates on the most pressing human rights problems.
GLAF 30132	This course provides an introduction to mixed methods research in global affairs and prepares undergraduate students to design and conduct independent research. Students will learn how rigorous qualitative and quantitative information can be integrated to answer complex research questions. It will also strengthen student's ability to be informed consumers of research presented in academic publications and the media.
GLAF 30140	In 2007, after decades of organizing on the part of indigenous activists, the United Nations issued a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Declaration was the result of years of work by people from particular communities--each with its own history, culture, language, and home--who decided to call themselves, and work together as, Indigenous people. This creative step allowed indigenous peoples to work collectively for justice on a global scale, rather than individually and in confrontation with single states. This class explores the concept, and reality, of Indigeneity in both historical and contemporary perspective: we will consider the many shared struggles and opportunities of indigenous peoples around the globe today and the ways that similar (or distinct) histories have led to similar (or distinct) present realities.
GLAF 30141	This course examines the origins and development of contemporary opinions and policies concerning migrations and migrants. It does so by looking backward to the age when transoceanic mobility became more frequent and increasingly more accessible before moving forward to our own times. It is the central claim of this course that it is impossible to understand what drives policy today without first surveying the changing ideas of migration and the movement of people over time. It will therefore take students through the history of migration in the modern world, as well as studying the migrant journey, connections to home, the process and difficulties of assimilation and community creation, and the problems or opportunities that could arise for migrants from characteristics like race, religion, ethnicity, or language. Also considered will be the complex relationship between colonization and migration. In the process, Migrants and Mobility will also examine how different societies place value judgments upon migrants and analyze how and why migration/migrants have been categorized as “good” or “bad” over time. Students will also encounter and consider the effects of growing urbanization and industrialization, changing demography and global trade patterns, and, more recently, the impact of climate change. Migrants and Mobility will be primarily seminar based, placing a premium on participation and analytical discussion.
GLAF 30142	Politics, markets, and the environment are all spheres of development that are fundamentally shaped by the action and interaction of many individuals over time. For example, the Arab Spring protests, the shortage of medicines in Caracas, and the rising water temperatures of the Baltic Sea are all system-level outcomes arising from the individual actions of thousands or even billions of people. In these spheres, leadership is often weak or non-existent. Scientists call these &quot;complex systems.&quot; Complexity is difficult to study in the real world. Instead, scientists often approach these phenomenon using computer simulations (sometimes called agent-based models, social network models, and computational models). The goal is to build computer models of development that link the actions and interactions of individuals to the system-level outcomes. This class will use the perspective, literature, and tools of complexity science to approach core questions in the field of development. No programming experience is required, but students should be prepared to learn a new language called Netlogo. It is a free program which is described as having a &quot;low threshold&quot; (easy to get started) and &quot;high ceiling&quot; (many capabilities).
GLAF 30143	Conserving the earth's rich biological heritage while enhancing the well-being of some of the world's poorest people stands as a critical global challenge. This course examines this complex issue using the lens of political science and related fields such as political ecology, gender studies, and sustainability science. It will demonstrate how insights and approaches from these areas of scholarship can help understand and address the twin problems of biodiversity loss and poverty in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Examples will focus on forest and wildlife conservation and management. This course will be of interest to students from a wide range of natural and social science disciplines.
GLAF 30144	This course examines the interplay between history, memory and violence in the modern Middle East. We will discuss specific case studies of wars and other forms of violence and their social, political and cultural dynamics of commemoration, forgetfulness and silence. The course will start with an overview of theories and concepts from the field of Memory Studies and follow with our case studies. These will include Zionist and Palestinian national myths, the 1948 war that led to the establishment of Israel and to Palestinian displacement, the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990), the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1989, the Armenian genocide during World War I, the Algerian War of Independence (1955-1962) and the Syrian civil war (2011- ?).
GLAF 30145	Politics of Latin America is intended to be a multi-disciplinary introduction to critical issues within contemporary Latin American culture, society, politics, and economy. An assumption behind the organization of this course is that many of the traditional boundaries between different disciplines in the social sciences and the humanities are drawn somewhat arbitrarily, and that a more comprehensive understanding of Latin America can, and even should, be approached from a number of different analytic and disciplinary lenses. Thus, we will trespass traditional disciplinary boundaries from time to time over the course of the semester. The course is divided into two major parts. The first part is organized around a number of key analytic lenses, which we will employ sequentially with an aim to gaining a deeper appreciation of important aspects of contemporary Latin America. We will begin with a discussion of the utility of &quot;culture&quot; as a tool for understanding Latin America. Is there such a thing as &quot;Latin America&quot; understood as a discrete category of countries, and if so, what do they share in common? We will follow this discussion with an exploration of what is certainly a chief cultural expression among any people, an exploration of levels of religiosity and their relationship to social and political behavior. Other key features of culture will be woven into the analyses of the case studies we will undertake for the remainder of the course. We will explore the wide variation in the quality of democratic governance in different Latin American countries. And we will we look to some of the sources of that variation, including democratic institution building, economic and social policy making, and the persistence of populist politics, and forces in the international arena, such as U.S Foreign Policy, among other factors. In the remainder of the course, we will look specifically at country-cases in comparative perspective, in particular Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela. In selecting these cases, I have made a conscious decision to sacrifice breadth for greater depth. An effort will be made throughout the discussion of the cases to make broader comparisons with a wider range of Latin American cases.
GLAF 30901	This course explores the myriad of national security policy challenges facing the United States and the policy options to address these challenges. The course will explore security issues with Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as well as climate change, global health/pandemics, cyber threats/security and terrorism/extremism. The course will include lectures by policy experts and student engagement with these experts to explore policy options and their potential for success. Students will conduct research of primary source policy documents to develop a policy memorandum for the US National Security Council that will outline a policy challenge for the United States and recommend policy options for consideration.
GLAF 30903	This course will explore the role of global business in reducing poverty, inequality and attending to the needs of all stakeholders. Students will be introduced to the rapidly growing fields of impact investing and sustainable finance which support socially conscious and environmentally friendly innovations.  Students will gain a broad overview of the financial and economic tools available, beyond government assistance and philanthropy, to support broad based wealth creation, equality of opportunity and natural resource preservation. Students will be invited to participate in policy debates on certain topics and will read mini case studies on subjects such as microfinance, &quot;place based&quot; community investment and the role of CDFIs, and the issuance of green/blue sustainability bonds.  Guest speakers/practitioners will be invited to engage the students in real world problem solving. The course will culminate in a small group project or paper to &quot;reexamine business&quot; as a force for good, which will be presented in class. It is open to students of all intended majors with no prerequisites, and should serve as a foray to several future areas of study such as global affairs, social entrepreneurship and sustainability.
GLAF 40105	The new wave of technologies, e.g., robotics and AI will have long-lasting impacts on the labor market. Jobs will be displaced, new tasks will be created, different skills will be demanded, and new management practices will emerge. These new technologies may benefit workers unevenly, potentially increasing inequality. At the same time, new demographic challenges driven by aging will have large impacts on labor. How will these forces affect the future of labor and how should we prepare for changes in the labor market? The goal of this course is to provide students with a framework for analyzing how new technologies like robotics and AI will affect the labor market drawing largely from the economics literature. Students will analyze and describe the literature on these topics and understand the different methodologies used in the literature. Ultimately, students will build perspectives on how AI and robotics could affect jobs, occupations, the future of work, income distribution and social institutions. Students will also build perspectives on education, training, and redistribution policies that can help mitigate the labor market disruptions created by technological change. Students will collect and analyze data that can provide insights on the future of labor.
GLAF 40107	What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films. Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba).
GLAF 40110	This class explores the use of marketing principles and concepts to support initiatives, causes and ventures that are social in nature. Attention is devoted to the marketing and communication challenges involved when attempting to do good, and how these issues can be overcome without spending large amounts of money. Sample topics include identifying and understanding target markets for social initiatives, constructing a value proposition, developing positioning approaches, designing communication programs, use of guerrilla techniques, the roles of price and place, and how to set goals and measure performance.
GLAF 40113	“Climate and Environmental Justice” is a lecture- and discussion-based class primarily targeted at undergraduates. It is designed to introduce you to the core and crucial concepts of climate justice and environmental justice, with a particular emphasis on existing legacy injustices and the injustices we are currently creating as environmental pollution, climate change, and human systems interact. We will discuss existing patterns of burden, inequality, poverty, and threats to human dignity, and discuss opportunities and mechanisms to repair and avoid injustice. In particular we will discuss environmental injustice as a widely experienced but largely localized experience of disproportionate burden (e.g., on the basis of race and class) associated with extraction, industrialization, and non-greenhouse gas environmental pollution, alongside climate injustice as a global and emergent phenomenon of severe and disproportionate impacts from climate change. We will address concepts of reparations and remediation, as well as governance and other strategies for enacting justice. We will also address links between climate and environmental justice with related movements focused on adaptation, energy, housing, transportation, health, and land. Our focus will be both domestic and international, with attention directed to power dynamics, vulnerabilities, and opportunities for corrective action. Climate change and the energy transition will be major themes given their deep relationship with both climate and environmental justice, particularly as processes of industrialization and deindustrialization associated with decarbonization proceed. Overall, the course will focus on patterns, drivers, and opportunities for corrective action associated with severe injustices associated with climate change and environmental burden.
GLAF 40114	This five-week course will examine forced migration from the perspective of the beliefs, teachings, and programmatic commitments of faith communities. The first week will be devoted to identifying the causes of and global trends in forced migration, as well as the categories of forced migrants. It will also explore the “law of migration”; that is, the diverse legal systems that migrants must negotiate on their journeys and that religious actors use to assess migration policies. The second week will explore the teachings of diverse faith communities on forced migration, their understanding of this immense and growing phenomenon, and their programmatic and policy responses. The third week will segue to state-centered approaches to the governance and management of migration, with a focus on the concepts of sovereignty and the rule of law. It will also consider ideologies such as nativism and exclusionary nationalism that are in tension with the beliefs, policy positions, and programs of religious actors. The fourth week will be devoted to guest speakers and student presentation on situations of protracted displacement throughout the world. Persons in protracted displacement have lived in exile for at least five years and have no viable course out of their “long lasting and intractable status of limbo.” The fifth week will be devoted to US refugee protection trends and policies.
GLAF 40115	At a moment when global challenges - from climate change to inclusive development to public health threats - loom large, many nation-states seem unable to come together to address them. In what ways are the world's cities and subnational governments working on their own and in concert to meet these challenges? This course examines the distinctive roles and capacities of cities, provinces, and states in managing global policy issues and explores different modes of trans-local cooperation and coordination. We start by considering the global governance shortcomings of nation-states and exploring the multilevel character of key policy challenges. We next use case studies from different issue-areas to assess how action by subnational governments is contributing to but also complicating solutions. We conclude by discussing the limitations of subnational approaches to global challenges and considering the most appropriate policy roles and portfolios for subnational actors in the 21st century.
GLAF 46000	Directed Readings in Global Affairs are courses in which students meet with a faculty member to discuss, analyze, and interpret a set of agreed-upon texts in a given field of study. The proposed course or study may not duplicate or reflect content or regularly offered courses, and the work should reflect the intellectual challenge, intensity, and time commitment reflected in the number of credit hours awarded. The Keough School will normally limit to two the number of Directed Readings that may fulfill the requirements of its degree program, and students pursuing Directed Readings should have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in their major. A formal application is required, which must include a syllabus and justification statement. Students should have a clear topic they want to pursue and have identified and spoken with a faculty member before requesting a copy of the application form from the Keough School Dean's Office.
GRED 60802	Leadership Advancing Socially Engaged Research is for selected students only.
GRED 68001	Intensive writing and research experiences (one five-day, one three day, and one one-day). Interdisciplinary seminars on setting boundaries for writing time; sustaining motivation; perspectives on publishing; proactive committee engagement; peer review; and approaches to co-writing. Open to doctoral students in the College of Arts and Letters who are in the dissertation-writing phase of their studies.
GRED 68011	Inclusive Pedagogy course approved through winter session committees. 
GRED 70555	This is the GRED course affiliated with the NSF-sponsored Responsible Innovation Fellowship program. For each of its three years, this project recruits a cohort of 9-12 doctoral students, postdocs, and law students to work in small interdisciplinary teams of 3-4 spanning the natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, humanities and law. In the first half of each year, fellows undergo training in Technology Ethics, Responsible Innovation (RI) and the IDEA Center's Commercialization Engine process. In the second half of each year, fellows will be connected to a real-world commercialization project through Notre Dame's technology transfer and incubation hub, the IDEA Center.
GSC 10001	This course provides students with an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of gender studies. It also serves as an introduction to gender itself—gender as identity, as a social/cultural formation, as a mode of self-expression, and as a critical lens through which to better understand the world. We will explore how gender is experienced, produced, and performed at the intersection of culture, politics, and the body, always in conjunction with other factors of power and difference such as race, nation, sexuality, dis/ability, and socioeconomic class. We will ask how institutions like government, work, and family interact with gender in the U.S. and in local contexts around the world. We will think critically about how ideology (systems of ideas and knowledge) and representation (portrayals in media, political discourse, and everyday life) shape our understanding of gender. The study of gender reaches into, across, and beyond academic disciplines. This course will explore how research on gender is done both within the interdisciplinary field of gender/women/sexuality studies and across many other fields, taking up debates and conversations about gender from history, sociology, anthropology, biology, literature, philosophy, political science, geography, and other disciplines that engage gender as a subject of knowledge.
GSC 20466	The family is the most fundamental institution of all known societies, and the study of families is a core area of sociological inquiry. The word &quot;family&quot; is one that is pervasive in society, but it can have multiple meanings in various contexts, and it is a more difficult concept to define than we may initially think. What &quot;family&quot; means changes over time and varies across cultures, and there is much continual debate about what a family should be. By the end of this course, you should have a much broader understanding of what a &quot;family&quot; is and the significance of families for our society. It is within the family that socialization occurs and the family is the site where we derive many of our personal experiences, which may give the impression that &quot;family&quot; is very personal. Yet, the institution of the family is fundamentally intertwined with larger institutions such as the economy, the workplace, and the state. Additionally, families can both reflect and reinforce societal inequities, such as those based on class, race, and gender. We therefore assess these linkages by taking a sociological approach to studying the family.
GSC 20540	In this course, we will examine the role of labor in American literature from the decades before the Civil War to the late 20th century through the critical lens of Audre Lorde's theorization of the erotic. Through this theorization, Lorde identifies the intimate and varying relationships to power that are revealed when gender identity, race, sexuality, and class intersect with labor in U.S. American culture. We will critically examine what these classed, gendered, and raced aspects of labor reveal about American culture, ideology, identity, and future trajectories. We will interrogate, reflect, and deconstruct how writers affirm, challenge, and negotiate identity and conceptualize American society through representations of labor.
GSC 20650	The objective of this course is to explore the intricate tapestry of the multiethnic and multicultural Italian peninsula during the Late Middle Ages (12th-15th Centuries) and its interactions with Mediterranean societies. Throughout this course, we will dissect pivotal historical events, cultural and religious exchanges, geographical implications, and the traditions of the primary populations inhabiting the region. Our journey through this rich history will be guided by Italian authors of short stories, offering us a profound insight into this captivating fusion of civilizations.  During the Late Middle Ages, Italians, particularly Venetians, Pisans, Genoese, and Florentines, reigned as the foremost commercial and naval powerhouses in the Mediterranean. Eminent Tuscan literary figures and intellectuals such as Giovanni Boccaccio, Franco Sacchetti, and Giovanni Sercambi (to name just a few) demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture and expertly convey in their narratives the multifaceted sociological, political, religious, geographical, historical, and psychological intricacies characterizing this enduring cultural crossroads.  Within the intricate and interconnected Mediterranean environment, the short story indisputably emerged as the most prevalent and esteemed literary genre, transcending cultural and geographic boundaries. This genre encompasses a vast array of themes, meticulously portraying courtly love, chivalric values, the far-reaching impacts of the Crusades, the interplay among the three Monotheistic Religions, the tensions between nobility and bourgeoisie, varying perspectives on women and their societal roles from Spain to the Arabic domains, encounters – and sometimes conflicts – between distinct cultures, pivotal Mediterranean historical events, and the initial ventures into geographical exploration. As our course unfolds, we will discover that these themes represent only a fraction of the myriad facets that the short story has adeptly embraced and narrated for generations of avid readers.
GSC 20902	This course will introduce students to the main topics, themes, and debates in Atlantic history, focusing on Spanish and Portuguese America and the Caribbean. It will begin with an overview of slavery and other legal and labor systems in West Africa and the Americas, and then examine how and why the Portuguese and Spanish entered into a slaving trade in West Africa, and what ensued from contact with the American hemisphere after 1492. We will end with abolition and emancipation in the Americas. Along the way we will examine the rise and fall of “Indian” slavery, the cultural meanings of Blackness, the labor and economic conditions in urban settings as well as on rural plantations, and the strategies that enslaved people used to negotiate living conditions and achieve freedom. We will also pay careful attention to different kinds of resistance, including the formation of stable palenques of those who escaped slavery and a variety of rebellions, including the successful Haitian Revolution. Weekly readings will include modern accounts and historical documents. Assignments will predominantly be medium-length (5-7 pages) essays using primary sources and one exercise using the TransAtlantic Slave Trade Database. We also hope to utilize the collections at the Raclin Murphy Art Museum.
GSC 30123	If you were to perform a Google image search of “human evolution,” you would see endless pictures of men linearly evolving from apes to modern humans. These overwhelmingly one-sided depictions are because much of our human evolutionary story has been written by and about men to the exclusion of women. Consequently, many of the key theories explaining the unique suite of human features seem to assume that evolutionary forces act only upon men, and women are merely passive beneficiaries. Not only is this exclusion of roughly half the population sexist, it is also bad science – bad science that to this day has been repeated and perpetuated to justify the status quo. In this class, we will explore human evolution from a feminist perspective intellectually drawing upon human biology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, primatology, exercise physiology, and reproductive health to demonstrate that women were and still are a driving force in human evolution. Using non-traditional learning methods and assignments, we will cover: 1) foundational feminist human evolutionary theory, 2) the pervasiveness of estrogen, 3) physical/athletic performance and sexual division of labor; 4) the significance and frequency of alloparenting; 5) multiple orgasms and the control of women’s sexuality; 6) cooperation and competition among women; 7) concealment (or not) of human ovulation; 8) evolutionary reasons for the difficulty of human birth; 9) the physical and mental resilience of women; and 10) the crucial role grandmothers and menopause. It is my hope that this class not only provides an alternative perspective to current thinking in human evolution, but also encourages students to bring their experiences and perspectives to bear. Because who asks the questions matters, and a greater diversity of views can only improve and enrich our holistic understanding of human evolution.
GSC 30586	What did it mean to be a &quot;man&quot; or a &quot;woman&quot; in Japan in the centuries before the modern era? How did conceptions of masculinity and femininity evolve under the influence of Buddhism and Confucianism, not to mention changes in the social order? Above all, how was gender &quot;performed&quot; when it came to matters of the heart? In this course, students will explore these issues, primarily through fiction and drama, but also through diaries, essays, and poetry.   The course is divided into three units. Unit 1 surveys the literature of the Imperial court from the 8th through the 12th centuries. We will begin with selections of love poetry from the Man'y?sh?, Tales of Ise, and Kokinsh? as background for Murasaki Shikibu's epic of courtly love, The Tale of Genji (ca. 1000 A.D.). Unit 2 focuses on plays from the N? theater, which typically dramatize the problem of desire from a Buddhist perspective. In Unit 3, we will explore the issues of gender and sexuality in Ihara Saikaku's Five Women Who Loved Love (1685) and plays by Chikamatsu Monzaemon, such as The Love-Suicides at Amijima (1721). All materials are in English and no special knowledge of Japan or Japanese is required. Students will also read essays by Western scholars to acquire a critical perspective on the issues of gender and sexuality in specific texts. As instructor, I will explain the social and literary conventions that shaped each kind of text, while the study questions and class discussions will focus on how the texts idealized, challenged, or otherwise interrogated male and female gender roles and the problem of desire.
GSC 30626	This course provides students with a broad, foundational understanding of the concepts, theories, and methodologies used in critical analyses of rock's various gendered constructions.  Rather than taking a musicological perspective, this course uses a socio-cultural approach to examine a myriad of gendered sites within rock culture, including performance, music video, and rock journalism.  Therefore, music and song lyrics will not be our only or primary objects of study; our exploration of rock's gendered culture will also include studies of the various roles, practices, technologies, and institutions associated with the production and consumption of rock music. In focusing on these various sites within rock culture, a synthetic, interdisciplinary approach is employed which draws on theories and methodologies formulated in such fields as popular music criticism, musicology, cultural studies, sociology, ethnography, literary analysis, performance studies, and critical media studies.  In turn, the course is strongly informed by feminist scholarship and theories of gender.
GSC 30634	This course traces the rise of consumer society in the United States from the colonial era through the late twentieth century. It asks how Americans came to define the &quot;good life&quot; as one marked by material abundance and how transformations in buying and selling have shaped American culture, politics, and national identity. One of our aims will be to develop a usable historical definition of consumer society and to evaluate when such a society emerged in the United States. We will examine the role that consumption has played in defining and policing ideals of gender, race, sexuality, and class. We will also consider how Americans have used consumer practices and spaces to advance political claims and notions of citizenship. The course is organized around key turning points in American consumer capitalism: the consumer boom of the eighteenth century; the market revolution and feminization of consumption; the birth of the department store; the rise of mass consumption and commercial leisure; the development of modern advertising and sales; the spread of chain stores and shopping malls; and the globalization of American consumer culture. In addition to recent scholarship and text-based primary sources, we will analyze artifacts of consumer culture, such as advertisements, catalogs, product labels, broadsides, film, and television.
GSC 30642	Between the early rumblings of the Reformations and the last cannon shot of World War I, Europeans profoundly changed how they conceptualized bodies as experience and metaphors. During these four centuries, Europeans grounded the ways in which they interacted with each other and the world in bodily imaginings. On an individual level, the living, human body provided a means of accessing and understanding the material or spiritual world. On a collective scale, the physical body, its adornments, and its gestures provided markers that Europeans used to fracture society along axes of gender, sexuality, class, race, mental aptitude, and even sacrality. Drawing in part from their myriad imaginings of the human body, Europeans constructed metaphorical political bodies. The body politic assumed diverse forms spanning from divine right monarchs to revolutionary republics to modern nation states. Our course will lay bare the human body as culturally constructed, while fleshing out how Europeans' evolving visions affected political imaginings.
GSC 30669	Feminism isn't only about women, nor is feminism only for women. Feminism is about power - about who has it and who doesn't. And in today's world, data is power. Data can be used to create communities, advance research, and expose injustice. But data can also be used to discriminate, marginalize, and surveil. This course will draw intersectional feminist theory and activism to identify models for challenging existing power differentials in data science, with the aim of using data science methods and tools to work towards justice. Class meetings will be split between discussions of theoretical readings and explorations of data science tools and methods (such as Tableau, RStudio, and Python). Those readings may include chapters from texts that include Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein's Data Feminism (2020), Virginia Eubanks's Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor (2018), Ruha Benjamin's Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code (2019), and Sasha Costanza-Chock's Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need (2020). This course will also examine the data advocacy and activism work undertaken by groups like Our Data Bodies, Data for Black Lives, the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, and Chicago-based Citizens Police Data Project. Over the course of the semester, students will develop original research projects that use data to intervene in issues of inequality and injustice. This course is not about gaining mastery of particular data science tools or methods, therefore familiarity with statistical analysis or data science tools (R, RStudio, Python, etc.) is NOT a prerequisite for this course.
GSC 30679	The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 26% of Americans (about 61 million people) have a disability—a physical, intellectual, sensory, or self-care impediment that affects major life activities. This course considers this population, their stories and experiences, as well as how disability—as a social, cultural, legal, and political construct—has shaped the nation and its history. A particular focus of the course will be on disability and social justice. Throughout American history, and still today, disabled people have been denied basic civil rights, such as voting, marrying, holding property, and living independently. This course will examine how these restrictions developed and changed over time as well as how disabled people have fought for greater access and equality. Coursework may include response papers, primary source analysis, and a final project.
GSC 30951	This interdisciplinary research lab enlists students in the efforts of the Just Wage Initiative (JWI), a collaborative research and advocacy project of the Higgins Labor Program at the Center for Social Concerns. Students will help develop, refine, and update the Just Wage Framework, a multistakeholder online tool designed to advance a more inclusive and equitable economy. Students will also undertake research projects connecting their own intellectual interests and disciplinary expertise to the JWI?s foundational question: What makes any given wage just or unjust? In addition, students will collaborate with the instructor and local, national, and international practitioners to envision and execute advocacy campaigns to promote a just wage economy. Extended weekly class sessions will facilitate visits by scholars and activists, interactive group discussions, and collaborative experiments. 
GSC 30952	In 1964, when Martha Reeves sang, &quot;Calling out around the world/Are you ready for a brand new beat?/Summer's here and the time is right/For dancing in the street,&quot; was she beckoning listeners to join a party or the civil rights struggle? Or both? From spirituals sung by enslaved workers to protest anthems shouted at union rallies, music has provided the soundtrack to social justice causes throughout American History. Whether performed by rank-and-file reformers or famous recording artists -- from Frank Sinatra to Nina Simone to Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, and beyond -- popular music has accompanied and sometimes fueled transformations in American politics, culture, and social life. In this course students will explore American popular music in its many forms -- blues, country, jazz, folk, rock, punk, disco, hip hop, tejano, and more -- to understand its power and limits as both a force for social change and a window into major themes of the American experience.
GSC 31626	Lab Screening for Corequisite GSC 30626
GSC 33607	This course traces the changing history of sexual and gender identities in the USA between roughly 1890-present. We begin with the early 20th century’s “invention” of the binary hetero or homo sexual identity -- a rigid dualism that (from today’s point of view) would structure even the most radical challenges to normative gender and sexual identities through until the last decades of the twentieth. We conclude by briefly considering the sources and extent of radically “queer” challenges to gender and sexual binaries, beginning in the 1990s. As much as possible, we will draw on the words and images of those who struggled to define themselves -- their art, music, film, literature, interviews, oral histories, memoirs and autobiographies. The class will analyze these using various existing historical and other disciplinary frameworks. In addition, students will deepen our historical knowledge by sharing their own research on a topic of their choice (1890-2015). Our learning will be discussion-based and collaborative.
GSC 35000	This course connects students with a community-based partner organization related to the student's interests in career development and social justice. In collaboration with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, students choose a community partner organization for which they serve as an unpaid intern. In fall/spring semesters, students perform 6-8 hours of internship service per week for their chosen internship site, completing a minimum of 80 total hours. During summer session, students work 5-8 weeks full time, as defined by the internship site. Work on-site is overseen by a designated agency supervisor; coursework is supervised and evaluated by the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students are expected to complete a short set of readings before the internship begins. Additional assignments include: weekly journal entries; a final reflection paper that summarizes the internship experience and explores its connections to the student's Gender Studies education; an updated resume that includes the internship. This course may be taken during any of the three academic sessions in junior or senior year, and may be counted as an elective towards any Gender Studies undergraduate degree.
GSC 40001	This interdisciplinary seminar provides students with an overview of key concepts and terms in theories about gender and closely related topics. Students will read prominent feminist and queer theorists of gender, analyze their arguments, and learn to critique and apply them. We will explore contemporary theories, including those from outside feminist theory, that expand our understanding of gender beyond the binaries of male/female and masculine/feminine, consider conceptions of kinship beyond heteronormative models, and explore the ways gendered distinctions operate in dynamic interaction with other forms of difference such as race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic class, sexuality, and religion. Our overriding project will be to understand what these theories mean in their specific sociohistorical contexts and to contemplate their potential implications for our own and others’ lives, and for culture and society at large. This seminar requires close reading and discussion of theoretically rigorous and critically sophisticated texts and thus requires the active participation of committed students.
GSC 40304	In this course we will read of all of Austen’s novels, supplemented by helpful contemporary texts, and critical commentary on the works. We will attend to Austen’s style (her elegance, her irony, her rudeness); her aesthetic principles; her political and social engagements, (her views on slavery and Empire, the “revolution in female manners” advocated by Mary Wollstonecraft, her critique of masculinity); the function of the marriage plot; and the relationship between the novel and the theatre. Students will gain an appreciation for the complexity of the work of one of the greatest novelists in the English language. They will also consider how these works respond to the historical moment in which they were written, and how and why these works resonate across time.
GSC 40514	This course will examine constructions of gender in the works of Irish playwrights.
GSC 40522	Scholars and activists use the concept of the &quot;carceral state&quot; to describe the official, government use of criminalization, surveillance, and mass imprisonment to exercise control over society. This course examines the histories, cultures, politics, and economics of the US carceral state. Reading feminist scholarship from across the disciplines, we will study its genealogy — beginning with the surveillance embedded in the earliest practices of slavery and settler colonialism, tracing its development through the 19th and early 20th centuries, and concluding with the rise of the modern prison industrial complex. We will then focus on contemporary case studies including the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; immigrant detention, sex-crime regulation, and police violence. Finally, we will consider alternatives to prisons and policing, as we learn about academic research and activist movements working to end state violence, abolish prisons, defund police, and build opportunities for restorative justice. We will ask and address such questions as: How does the US carceral state function as a tool for social control? What histories, policies, and ideologies underlie the carceral state? How have individuals and organizations worked to reform, transform, or abolish the carceral state? How have media and the arts been used to normalize and/or critique the carceral state? And can we imagine a world without prisons or police?
GSC 40531	This course focuses on critical analyses of identities in media culture.  Taking a cultural studies approach, we will interrogate theories and popular discourses of identity while exploring how identities are constructed, negotiated, resisted, and transformed within media culture.  Our primary questions in this course are: What is identity?  How do our identities inform our various relationships to media culture?  And, how does media culture impact the construction of our identities?  Our sites of analysis will be media representation (narrative, performance, aesthetics), media production (industrial and alternative), and media consumption (reception practices and audiences). We will examine a broad array of media forms, including film, television, the Internet, and popular music. Conventional demographic identities, such as gender, age, race, sexuality, class, and religion, are central to the course, although other identities, including geographic, lifestyle, and virtual identities, will be examined also.  We will strive toward critical analyses that understand identities as socially constructed, not biologically determined, and intersectional, not autonomous.
GSC 40537	In this seminar we will examine the historical construction of gendered and sexual roles in the Spanish colonial world. This will entail thinking about gender and sexuality in the societies which &quot;encountered&quot; each other in the New World, and also thinking about how that encounter produced new forms of gendered and sexual relations. Among the questions we'll consider: how was the conquest gendered? How did colonial society produce masculinities as well as femininities? What gendered forms of power were available to women? How did ethnicity and casta (a status attributed to mixed race peoples), as well as gender and class, determine people's sense of themselves and their &quot;others&quot;? What were normative and non-normative sexual roles in the pre-modern Americas, and how did a European Catholic conquest affect these?
GSC 40556	This course will explore novels and short fiction (mainly British) written between 1880 and the middle of the 20th century, a period organized by dramatic shifts in cultural understandings of gender and sexuality. Experimental, middlebrow, and popular novels attempted to represent the modern through depictions of new sorts of subjects: New Women, suffragettes, flappers, sapphists, typists, war workers, and more. Attention to these figures will give us an opportunity to notice how modern fiction engaged the texture of modern life through representations of free love and divorce; of reproduction, birth control, and abortion; queer sexuality; domestic and paid labor; and more. 
GSC 40567	An exploration of how the voices of women have helped to reshape theological discourse and to bring to light new dimensions of the living Christian tradition.  Using the writings of feminist, womanist, Latina, mujerista, Asian, and Third World theologians, this course will focus on the significance of gender and social location in understanding the nature and sources of theology, theological anthropology, Christology/soteriology, the mystery of God, and women's spirituality.
GSC 40579	Is it possible to think of the 21st century as a post-racial, post-feminist world?  In her provocative 2012 study, Body as Evidence:  Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender, Janell Hobson suggests that rather than having been eradicated, millennial hopes that the historical difficulties represented by race and gender have lost their significance in the present day are as far, if not even further away from the mark as they have ever been.  For Hobson, policing the body, whether that be in terms of its race, its gender, or its sexuality, has remained paramount.  &quot;...[W]hile the early-twenty-first century discourse of 'postracial' and 'postfeminist' often declares the loss of meaning attached to race and gender,&quot; she argues, &quot;...the global scope of our media-reliant information culture insists on perpetuating raced and gendered meanings that support ideologies of dominance, privilege, and power.&quot;  In Hobson's view, the body and how it is imagined rests at the center of such ideologies, pointing also to a number of crucial questions that become particularly important when considering the significance of race and gender through the lens of modernity.  How might a reconsideration of race point also to a rethinking of gender and vice-versa?  What does race actually mean?  How does/can it alter the way we understand gender?  Is it possible to think race beyond the idea of race? What might a new conception of race actually look like, and how might this influence our thinking on gender?   How are the problems of race and gender intertwined, and how is/has the body been imagined in and through them? What can such questions tell us about today's racial and gendered realities, both inside and outside the university, both in the past and the present?  This course takes a step backward to investigate these and other like questions in the context of the utopic impulse and its emphasis on the imagination in several 19th-century American authors whose work may be viewed as participating in a broad yet under-acknowledged vision of race, gender and Atlantic modernity that seeks to interrogate hierarchies of race and gender as these have been constructed and maintained within dominant ideologies.  Grounding our analysis in a number of 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century political philosophical texts on law and utopia and drawing on insights from critical race theory, gender studies, feminist theory, theories of law and literature, and utopian studies, our goal will be to gain a more nuanced understanding of our racialized past and its troubled link to questions of gender both then and now, so that we may better hope to imagine-and reimagine-the shape of our collective democratic future in the 21st century's global community.
GSC 40585	From anti-vaxxers to designer genes, this class explores some of the most important and challenging topics in medicine and society today. Students will gain an understanding of the ethical, social, and practical dimensions of a variety of healthcare and health policy issues. Students will also have the opportunity to engage directly with healthcare workers from around the US who will serve as guest speakers. Topics we will cover include the opioid and COVID-19 epidemics; stem cell research; brain death in pregnancy; and freedom of speech in clinical settings. This course is open to all and will be especially useful for those planning for careers in science, medicine, and public health.
GSC 40601	This course examines the intersection of gender, health policy, and health care organization around the world.  Gender is frequently a central contributing (though sometimes ignored) factor to people's health.  Men and women have different biologies, and it thus stands to reason that their lives—social, economic, political, and biological—would have an effect on their health.  What causes men to have different illnesses than women? What places one gender at greater risk for illness than the other?   How do men and women across the world experience health policies?  Are they affected and constrained by similar factors?  How do their work lives affect their experiences with health?  How is the body medically produced? How do poverty and development play a role in people's well-being?  Through an inquiry-based approach, these and other topics will be addressed in this class.
GSC 40623	When people think about sexuality, they often adopt a biological view - seeing sexuality as &quot;driven&quot; by hormones and nature. This course adopts a different approach by viewing sexuality through the lens of sociology - as shaped by social processes, including social interaction, institutions, and ideologies. It will focus on examining three aspects of sexuality: 1) The social, historical, and cultural factors that shape sexual behaviors, desires, identities, and communities; 2) The ways in which sex and sexuality are constantly regulated and contested at multiple levels of society, including within families, schools, workplaces, and religious and political institutions; and 3) The sources and effects of sexual inequality. While our focus will be on sexuality, we will also study how other identities (gender, race, class, religion, etc.) influence and affect it. Students will be encouraged to question taken-for-granted assumptions about sex and sexualities and formulate critical perspectives on issues pertaining to sexuality in today's public discourses. This course is sex-positive in that it assumes that knowledge about sexuality is empowering, not dangerous. The readings and discussions will be frank, and students will be assisted in developing a language for, and comfort level with, discussing a wide range of sexual topics in a respectful and sociological way. In the process, students will be challenged to improve their critical thinking, researching, writing, and public speaking skills.
GSC 40715	The nineteenth century saw the rise of print media and professional institutions. Old-fashioned whisper networks came to be viewed suspiciously as a dangerous, “feminine” pastime for those without lives of their own. Yet the enduring popularity of gossip—in society columns, romans-à-clef, communal laundry rooms, and political caricatures—meant that informal social networks thrived, fueled by a heightened interest in the private lives of famous people. The learning goals of this class extend beyond those of textual analysis and the researched argument to media literacy. Following several scandals across a variety of sources, we will study how information was transmitted via different genres, spaces, and voices in nineteenth-century France, looking at a range of texts from broadsheets to Offenbach operettas. While reinforcing social mores, gossip also provided a means of resistance to the status quo, a way for the marginalized to reframe official narratives and point to the humanity shared across classes and identities. Taught in French.
GSC 40759	In this course, we will deploy critical and creative modes of inquiry as we undertake a survey of mid- to late twentieth-century American poetry arising from New York City, which in the postwar period became a nexus of literary and artistic experimentation. It is within this geographic and historical framework that the New York School of Poets coalesced around the core figures of Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, Barbara Guest, and James Schuyler. Focusing on this dynamic array of poets as well as their precursors (e.g., Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein, Federico García Lorca), fellow travelers (e.g., Allen Ginsberg, Amiri Baraka, Frank Lima), and subsequent &quot;generations&quot; of New York poets (e.g., Joe Brainard, Bernadette Mayer, John Yau), we will consider how lines of affinity and intimacy as well as the cultural reverberations of the city drew together writers so diverse in outlook and method that Ashbery remarked, &quot;our program is the absence of any program.&quot; In this light, to figure out what it means to be part of the this anti-programmatic community, we will explore how the New York School intersected with the Beats, the Black Arts Movement, the Boston and San Francisco Renaissances, the Nuyorican Movement, and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Poetry—prompting us to consider how the concept of an avant-garde becomes, in this period, a ramifying network of friends, lovers, and intellectual rivals engaged in aesthetic cross-pollination. Our undertaking will be attentive to the intermedial dialogue between these poets and New York painters (e.g., Willem de Kooning, Fairfield Porter, Jane Freilicher), methods of collaboration, the influence of postmodern theory, and how race, gender, sexuality, and place shaped what has been cited as one of the most enduringly influential bodies of literature in the postwar world. Assignments will engage students' critical and creative talents.
GSC 40782	The first waves of feminism in South America during the late 19th and early 20th century were led by many women in the medical profession.  Julieta Lanteri and Sara Justo in Argentina, Ernestina López in Chile, or Paulina Luisi in Uruguay, to name a few, claimed for women’s rights in terms of health.  At the same time, medicine emerged as a dominant and masculinized discourse within the nation-states that sought to control women’s and non-binary bodies and behaviors.  In the 20th and 21st century, medical discourse was also in the center of feminist debates about motherhood, reproductive rights, obstetric violence, among others. This course will explore the connections between medicine and feminism through the life and works of women writers and activists from South America, from the late 19th to the 21st century.  We will also read essays, journal articles, and medical treatises from the 19th and 20th century and debate on the role of medical knowledge in the context of recent feminist movements.  Theoretical readings include Donna Haraway, Michel Foucault, Teresa de Lauretis, and numerous scholarly works on feminism, the history of medicine, and sexualities in South America (Salessi, Lavrin, Marino, Guy, Ben, among others).   The course will be taught in Spanish. Students should be able to read and write at the 4000 level (advanced intermediate / advanced).
GSC 40800	In this course we will critically examine issues of trauma and healing as they emerge in conflict situations and as challenges to peacebuilding. The course will be structured in three parts. In Part one, we will examine how theorists from such different disciplines as psychology, psychoanalysis, philosophy and cultural studies have conceptualized trauma and the necessary steps to recovery. In part two, we will review recent anthropological accounts that have emerged from areas of extreme trauma. These accounts will provide the backdrop for assessing the adequacy of the dominant theories of trauma and healing models, especially when these models are taken into cross-cultural contexts. In part three of the course we will reflect on the implications of our examination of trauma and healing for peacebuilding on both the micro and macro levels. We will consider the challenges and possibilities for working with victims of trauma in various cultural situations as well as the reality of secondary traumatic stress experienced by practitioners. On the macro level, we will consider how trauma research might broaden our understanding of ideals of reconciliation, forgiveness and restorative justice, as well as the advisability of truth-telling commissions and war-crimes tribunals.
GSC 43339	The goal of this class is to think philosophically together about a variety of food-related issues in a way informed by feminist perspectives. What we eat, how much we eat, how we think about the relationships between food and eating on the one hand and, on the other hand, health, beauty, cultural traditions, care for nonhuman animals, respect for agricultural workers, and concern for the environment—all of these are significantly impacted by social norms and power structures involving gender, race, and class. In recent decades philosophers have given a lot of thought to these topics. Feminists have also given a lot of thought to beauty ideals and body norms for women and their relationships to diet culture and disordered eating, and questions about how gender, race, and class  affect what we eat, how we eat, and what we think of as healthy eating. All of these issues and more are among the topics to be explored in this class.
GSC 43510	This course will use economic theory and empirical economic research to study the family.  Topics will include household decision making; the determinants of marriage and fertility; how marriage, fertility, and family structure are related to other outcomes; and public policies that affect the family and family formation.  Students will learn to read and evaluate empirical economic research.  This is a writing-intensive seminar course.
GSC 43521	This seminar on contemporary art will look at the home as it relates theoretically, materially, and historically to recent artistic practices. By examining artwork that takes the home as its source, subject, or material point of departure, we will consider how this site has been mined for its position as a place outside of the realm of professional artistic practices. Looking at the use of domestic materials and objects in art, as well as works that mimic domestic routines (housekeeping, childrearing, etc.) will play a large role in our investigations. Consideration will also be given to the ways in which artists have incorporated subsets of the domestic, such as the everyday, the amateur, and the banal into their creative processes and products.
GSC 43528	This seminar examines the rise of the modern fashion and garment industries in Europe and North America during the late 19th through the 20th century. While fashion is often viewed as a subject of interest only to women, this course contends that it has held significant meaning in the lives of both men and women, and of different classes and races. Clothing could signify who was praised as beautiful, modern, and respectable, or who was damned as immoral. We will trace such economic shifts as the movement from custom-made women's clothing to mass-produced ready-to-wear and the invention of the department store, and consider the impact of mass consumption on modern peoples. We will read how the aesthetics and practicality of women's and men's dress were criticized by reformers, and how American home economists taught the art of dressing according to standards of efficiency and beauty. We will address the impact of technological innovations, such as the removable collar and the stiletto heel, and of political concerns, such as the world wars and the Civil Rights Movement. We will pay particular attention to the dress revolutions of the 1920s and 1960s, and the question of whether they signaled concrete liberation or merely a fantasy of liberation.   Fulfills University Requirement - History
GSC 43604	In this course, students will explore the potential for studying and reconstructing a prehistory of people through archaeology.  We will consider the historical and theoretical foundations of creating an engendered past, the methodological and practical aspects of &quot;doing&quot; engendered archaeology, and the intersection between political feminism, archaeological knowledge production, and the politics of an engendered archaeology.  Topics for consideration include feminist perspectives on science, anthropology, and archaeology; concepts of gender in prehistory and the present; women's and men's relations to craft production, state formation, and space; and the complex relationship between feminism, archaeology, and the politics of women and men in archaeology and the archaeological past.  Under the broad theoretical, political and historical umbrella of feminism, archaeologists today are negotiating their own paths toward an engendered past from multiple directions, and this course will explore the diversity of these approaches toward creating a prehistory of people.
GSC 46000	Reading and research on specialized topics that are immediately relevant to the student's interests and not routinely covered in the regular curriculum.  Letter grade given.
GSC 47000	Special studies are available with gender studies-affiliated faculty.
GSC 48000	In collaboration with the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Gender Studies, students choose a Gender Studies faculty member who will guide them through the semester-long composition of a capstone essay. The capstone essay is an original and professional piece of scholarly writing based on the student's interdisciplinary research in their primary and supplementary majors. The capstone essay may build upon, but cannot replicate, the work done for a senior thesis or paper in another major or course. This course fulfills the senior capstone project requirement for Gender Studies supplementary majors. It can only be taken in the fall semester of the senior year. In the spring semester of the junior year, interested students should speak to the Gender Studies academic advisor about planning their thesis topic and research and securing a faculty advisor.  For the essay to be accepted by Gender Studies, the minimum page requirement is 20 pages.   
GSC 48002	In collaboration with the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Gender Studies, students choose a Gender Studies faculty member who will guide them through the year-long composition of a senior thesis. The senior thesis is a professional piece of scholarly writing featuring original research based on the student's interdisciplinary research in their gender studies major, ideally incorporating any additional fields of study they are pursuing. The Gender Studies senior thesis may build upon, but cannot replicate, the work done for a senior thesis or paper in another major or course. This course fulfills the senior capstone project requirement for Gender Studies majors. It is taken in the fall semester of the senior year (2 credits) and finished in the spring semester (1 credit). For the thesis to be accepted by Gender Studies, the minimum page requirement is 30-50 pages (excluding notes and bibliography).  In the spring semester of the junior year, interested students should speak to the DUS about planning their thesis topic and research and securing a faculty advisor. In the fall semester of the senior year, students will identify (in consultation with the DUS and their thesis advisor) a second Gender Studies faculty member to serve as a research consultant.  By the end of the fall semester, students submit to the DUS a working bibliography and a 1-2 paragraph summary of the project's direction to date (including total number of pages drafted); this prospectus is approved by both their thesis advisor and the second faculty member and is required for a passing grade on the fall semester. The thesis is due, approved by the thesis advisor, by the second Friday in April. Students are expected to submit their thesis to the Genevieve D. Willis Senior Thesis Prize Competition.
GSC 60001	This interdisciplinary seminar provides students with an overview of key concepts and terms in theories about gender and closely related topics. Students will read prominent feminist and queer theorists of gender, analyze their arguments, and learn to critique and apply them. We will explore contemporary theories, including those from outside feminist theory, that expand our understanding of gender beyond the binaries of male/female and masculine/feminine, consider conceptions of kinship beyond heteronormative models, and explore the ways gendered distinctions operate in dynamic interaction with other forms of difference such as race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic class, sexuality, and religion. Our overriding project will be to understand what these theories mean in their specific sociohistorical contexts and to contemplate their potential implications for our own and others’ lives, and for culture and society at large. This seminar requires close reading and discussion of theoretically rigorous and critically sophisticated texts and thus requires the active participation of committed students.
GSC 60209	In this course, we will examine the creation of &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sexuality&quot; as objects of development practices around the world. While development projects often assume that gender and sexuality are stable, coherent categories of identity, scholars have long shown that both take socially and historically specific forms as they emerge through social practices. In this course we will read a range of critical case studies that demonstrate the complicated ways that local and transnational ideas about gender, sexuality, and development intersect in everyday life around the world. This course will help you approach &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sexuality&quot;—two key terms in development discourse and global affairs—with an understanding of how these categories shape not just individuals but institutions, processes, and practices.
GSC 60526	This graduate seminar explores the history of women, gender relations, and ideas of sex difference in the United States, reaching from the colonial era to the late twentieth century. Issues of work, rights, citizenship, race, marriage, and sexuality take center stage as we explore the social, political, and cultural forces that shaped women's lives and the aspirations of those who sought to transform gender ideals and relations in the United States. The course is designed to introduce students to important questions, methodological approaches, and historiographical debates in the field through classic as well as cutting-edge scholarship. Our primary concern will be the United States, but we will take brief comparative glances to other nations and regions of the world.
GSC 60531	In this course, we will examine the intersections of migration with LGBTQ* identities. We will begin with James Baldwin's Another Country (1961) and explore the ways that migration and movement (in multiple senses), as seemingly fundamental aspects of queer identity, further intersect with race, ethnicity, and gender. Throughout the course, we will be asking - and responding to - several questions, such as: How is the idea of home, as space and place, explored by LGBTQ* writers?Is migration a necessary paradigm for thinking of and through the LGBTQ* community?How have cities been shaped by queer identities?How is migration expressed through textual form in LGBTQ* texts?How do race and ethnicity intersect with gender and sexuality?There are many more questions that will be raised, and these five are just some of the first that we will think through.This is an interdisciplinary course with a bit of an international focus. Because this course works through a range of film and literature, we will be discussing various formal strategies and methods used by each medium, and how these textual qualities map onto and explore content. We will be concerned with &quot;movement&quot; as a paradigm, and as such, will examine how movement is conveyed in film and literature, especially in regards to LGBTQ* identities.
GSC 60555	An exploration of how the voices of women have helped to reshape theological discourse and to bring to light new dimensions of the living Christian tradition. Like other liberation theologies, feminist theologies take the experience of suffering and missing voices in the tradition as the starting points for theological reflection on the mystery of God and all of reality in relation to God. Using the writings of feminist, womanist, Latina, mujerista, Asian, and Third World theologians, this class will focus on the following questions and areas of theology: the theological task and vocation, the significance of gender and social location in the fields of theological anthropology and Christology, theologies of the cross in the face of contemporary suffering, the mystery of God, and implications of women's spirituality in our day. Students will have the opportunity to join an optional reading group that will focus on classic texts in the development of feminist theologies.
GSC 60651	This course focuses on critical analyses of identities in media culture.  Taking a cultural studies approach, we will interrogate theories and popular discourses of identity while exploring how identities are constructed, negotiated, resisted, and transformed within media culture.  Our primary questions in this course are: What is identity?  How do our identities inform our various relationships to media culture?  And, how does media culture impact the construction of our identities?  Our sites of analysis will be media representation (narrative, performance, aesthetics), media production (industrial and alternative), and media consumption (reception practices and audiences). We will examine a broad array of media forms, including film, television, the Internet, and popular music. Conventional demographic identities, such as gender, age, race, sexuality, class, and religion, are central to the course, although other identities, including geographic, lifestyle, and virtual identities, will be examined also.  We will strive toward critical analyses that understand identities as socially constructed, not biologically determined, and intersectional, not autonomous.

On the macro level, we will consider how trauma research might broaden our understanding of ideals of reconciliation, forgiveness and restorative justice, as well as the advisability of truth-telling commissions and war-crimes tribunals.
GSC 63115	This graduate seminar, taught in English, explores the forms, functions, and stakes of a pervasive literary form in French and Occitan literatures from ca. 1150 to ca. 1500: debate literature. From the university classroom to the courtroom and from idyllic orchards to battlefields, debates offered a heuristic for participants and listeners to engage in controversy, put their virtuosity on display, and spark continued reflection on the relationship between self and thought. With a focus on courtly literature, we will examine how debates were set up, performed, and judged, teasing out some of the recurring stakes of this literary tradition. The ability to read in French is necessary, although English translations will be made available where possible.
GSC 63700	This course introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies (GWSS) by focusing on key concepts in feminist and queer research. We will discuss major figures in the development of the field, examine current theoretical debates and methodologies, and consider relevant pedagogical philosophies. The course offers a strong interdisciplinary underpinning for future research and teaching in GWSS and for GWSS-informed work across the disciplines. Course expectations include extensive reading, vigorous participation in discussion, and a final paper on a gender-focused topic of the student's choice. Students will have the option to satisfy some of the written requirement for the course by designing their own undergraduate GWSS or GWSS-informed syllabus along with two lesson plans.
GSC 67000	Special studies are available with gender studies-affiliated faculty. 
GSC 90981	This course takes its title from an anthology of poetry published at the millennium which gathered together writers from Britain and Ireland—many with origins elsewhere, from the Caribbean to South Asia—under the flexible rubric of being “other,” and engaged in avant-garde, oppositional poetics. The project has been echoed in poetics theory that throws its nets far wider, such as Jacob Edmond’s impressive book A Common Strangeness (2012), which reads across to Russia and China, too, from his native New Zealand, to “show how the poetics of strangeness—just as much as history, geopolitics, and economics—have shaped conceptions of the “global.” This course will consider such arguments and the accomplishments of such theoretical projects as it reads the work of Anglophone avant-garde communities and individual poets ranging from North America and the “Black Atlantic” to Europe and South Asia. Further stops may be planned depending on the interests of seminar members, and a final segment may include current work issuing from Ukraine. Requirements will involve consistent participation in discussion, partial planning and leading of seminar sessions, and a final, proto-publishable work whose goals and aspirational destination will be tailored to individual students and the degrees that they are pursuing.
HESB 20001	This course provides students with an overview of the American political system. Topics include the presidency, Congress, the Supreme Court, bureaucracy, separation of powers, federalism, political parties, interest groups, the public policy process, voting, public opinion, and participation.
HESB 20002	An introduction to economics, with particular attention to the pricing mechanism, competitive and monopolistic markets, government regulation of the economy, labor-management relations and programs, income determination and public policy, trade and the international economy.
HESB 20211	This course examines the interrelationships between economic injustice and violence. It begins by investigating the gap between rich and poor both in the US and worldwide. We also look at the history of Christian thought on wealth and poverty. We then address the ways in which economic disparity intersects with the problem of violence in both domestic (violence against women) and political realms (war and revolution). Next, we canvass Christian thought on the use of violence. This raises the question of whether Christianity itself contributes more to violence or to peace. Finally, we pose the question of whether forgiveness for violence is advisable or feasible. 
HESB 20213	We all recognize that the biomedical sciences change rapidly, but amid the seemingly intractable and interminable debate about healthcare reform in the US, it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that the same is true of the healthcare system. This interdisciplinary course will examine the American healthcare system in historical and comparative perspective. We look at its institutional structure, its professional composition, and its governance at various levels, with the end learning objective being to understand how these facets of the healthcare system shape not only national health outcomes, but also provider and patient experience. The course draws on the history, sociology and anthropology of medicine, and serves as one the core courses in the new Health, Humanities and Society Minor.
HESB 20218	This course is an introduction to political theory as a tradition of discourse and as a way of thinking about politics. The course surveys selected works of political theory and explores some of the recurring themes and questions that political theory addresses, especially the question of justice. This introductory course fulfills the political theory breadth requirement for the political science major.
HESB 20220	The United States is beset by many serious social problems such as educational inequality, extreme poverty alongside unparalleled abundance, crime and deviance, health disparities, mass incarceration, and the persistence of discrimination along lines of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, class, gender, and sexuality. Course materials are designed to engage student learning, illustrate the distinctive features of the sociological perspective, and to start you thinking sociologically about yourself and the broader world. To think sociologically requires you to recognize that our contemporary world, with its enduring cultural, political, and economic institutions, is as much a social product as we are. In this course, students will learn to take a sociological perspective not only in examining the causes, consequences, and solutions to some of society’s most troubling social problems, but also in taking a critical look at their own perceptions of problems.
HESB 20225	The family is often agreed to be the primary and most fundamental of social institutions. It is within this institution that early socialization and care-giving usually take place, and therefore, many of our ideas about the world are closely tied to our families. This course will give students the opportunity to learn about the diverse forms the family has taken over time and across different groups. This knowledge will be useful in examining the ongoing debate about the place of the family in social life. By taking a sociological approach to learning about the family and by gaining knowledge about national family trends and patterns in the U.S., this course will give students the theoretical and empirical tools for understanding how family life is linked to the social structure, to economic, cultural, and historical events and transitions, and to societal factors like race, class, and gender.
HESB 20229	This seminar examines a number of important topics in medicine and society today, including shared health responsibility, race and class-based inequities, vaccinations, opioid crisis, beginning and end-of-life care, organ donation and body modification, health of imprisoned populations, mental health of healthcare providers, and health in the age of social media. Students in this class will gain an understanding of the ethical, social, and practical dimensions of a variety of healthcare and health policy issues and how providers navigate these dimensions in their care. A key part of the class is the opportunity for students to engage directly with healthcare workers who will serve as guest speakers. The seminar will emphasize writing and journaling, and will directly integrate matters of health care with broader humanistic and social science approaches to health, wellbeing, the body, etc. to deepen students' understandings of what medicine is. This is a core course in the Health, Humanities, and Society minor.
HESB 20851	This course reflects on how Christians have understood and enacted the synergies and tensions between the commitments that come from their faith and the commitments that arise out of the civil and political communities to which they belong. We look both at important texts through history written by figures such as Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, and Bartolomé de las Casas, and also at exemplary figures over the past century who have given courageous witness to the difference that faith can make in difficult political times, including Cesar Chavez, Thomas Merton, Franz Jägerstätter, Dorothy Day, and Oscar Romero.
HESB 30033	Sixty years ago, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, in broad daylight, in the presence of hundreds of witnesses, while traveling in his presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas, Texas. On that day, a historic presidency came to a tragic end. Two days later, the alleged assassin (Lee Harvey Oswald) was murdered by a Dallas nightclub owner (Jack Ruby) while being escorted from his cell by a host of police officers, raising the possibility of a conspiracy. The official investigation into Kennedy's assassination (&quot;The Warren Report&quot;) was met with fierce public skepticism, precipitating numerous Congressional investigations that revealed extensive covert operations (both in the US and abroad) conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that would have been relevant to those charged with investigating the assassination. When combined with an already heightened public skepticism of the assassination itself, these revelations proved to be an enduring catalyst for a slow and steady decline of public trust in government that continues unabated to our present day. In this course, we examine the origins and rise of the &quot;security state&quot; in the United States, its role in significant events in the Kennedy presidency, including the investigation into his assassination, and the extent of its power both before and after Kennedy's presidency. Ultimately, students will be asked whether and to what extent the demands of national security conflict with the constitutional prerogatives of a representative democracy.
HESB 30034	This proposed course would cover a lot of constitutional terrain involved in the area of criminal justice, from investigative steps through trial and sentencing. It would cover significant issues in 4th , 5th , 6th and 8th Amendment law as well as situating them within broader philosophical concerns about justice, Catholic Social Teaching, and the questions of race.
HESB 30091	This course prepares students for their semester of study in Washington D.C., including their internship search.
HESB 30101	This course is designed to show students how to interpret and critically evaluate statistics commonly used to describe, predict, and evaluate in the social sciences, as well as many areas of the business and/or medical world.  The focus is on a conceptual understanding of what the statistic does, means and what assumptions are made from it.  Hands-on experience in using data analysis is part of the course.
HESB 30102	An examination of the language and analytical tools of microeconomics, emphasizing the functional relationship between the factor and product markets and resource allocation.
HESB 30104	This course seeks to introduce the student to the principles of probability and statistical theory appropriate for the study of economics. The emphasis of the course will be on hypothesis testing and regression analysis.
HESB 30286	In &quot;Constitutionalism, Law &amp; Politics II: American Constitutionalism,&quot; we shall study fundamental texts of the American constitutional and political tradition in an attempt to answer questions such as: What is the purpose of government? What is the meaning of political equality? What is political liberty and how is it best secured? Since we lack the time for a comprehensive survey of American political thinkers, we shall examine select statesmen and critical historical periods, focusing on the Founding era, Lincoln and the slavery crisis, and the Progressive era and New Deal.
HESB 30301	The United States is the most powerful state in the world today. Its actions are important not just for US citizens, but they also affect whether others go to war, whether they will win their wars, whether they receive economic aid, whether they will go broke, or whether they will starve. What determines US foreign policy? What is the national interest? When do we go to war? Would you send US soldiers into war? If so, into which wars and for what reasons? How do our economic policies affect others? Does trade help or hurt the US economy and its citizens? We first study several theories about foreign policy. We then examine the US foreign policy process, including the President, Congress, the bureaucracy, the media, and public opinion. To see how this all works, we turn to the history of US foreign policy, from Washington's farewell address through the World Wars and the Cold War to the Gulf War. We then study several major issue areas, including weapons of mass destruction, trade and economics, and the environment. Finally, we develop and debate forecasts and strategies for the future.
HESB 30304	This course examines the role of the government as defined by economic theory in the creation of public policy. Under ideal market conditions, competition promotes economic efficiency, leaving little to no role for the government with the possible of exception of policy to alter the distribution of income. Nevertheless, in many cases markets fail and government intervention may be necessary. The course will focus on concepts from microeconomics such as externalities, public goods, merit goods, asymmetric information, and income redistribution to understand how governments may construct policies to address economic problems and how government interventions will in turn affect the economy and distribution of well being.
HESB 30311	Global environmental politics is a field of political science that examines how political processes shape environmental outcomes and vice versa. On the one hand, it is concerned with issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation, and natural resource use. On the other hand, it studies things like political institutions, social movements, party systems, and state-business relations. All the while, it places these ideas in a cross-national, global perspective. Throughout this course, students will grapple with both foundational and emerging questions in the study of global environmental politics. Why do some governments have stronger environmental policies than others? When do interest groups support or oppose different forms of environmental regulation? What role do social movements play in supporting diverse coalitions of environmental interests? How do voters form and express preferences for or against environmental action?
HESB 30343	This course examines why some individuals decide to become immigrants through a cost benefit analysis, viewing migration as an investment in human capital. It addresses the selection among immigrants and how they integrate and assimilate in the destination country. Primary focus is given to the labor market, wages in particular, both of immigrants and of natives in the host country. A distinction is made between economic migrants and refugees and discrimination in its varied forms is also studied. The fiscal impact of immigration is discussed along with immigration policy in a global context. (Recommended Econ 10020/20020 Principles of Macroeconomics) 
HESB 30354	We are living through a watershed moment in United States history. Structural racism is at the forefront of the national discourse. Yet, the threat that racism holds on our nation's most cherished ideals of democracy and justice is hardly new. Generations of activists, scholars, and everyday people have fought and persevered to bring about social, cultural, and policy change.     This course engages deeply with topics relevant to the national discourse on racial and ethnic relations in the U.S. The first part of the course examines key concepts, focusing on the social construction of race and ethnicity, prejudice, and discrimination. The second part reviews the historical experiences of Native Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans. The third and final part of the course centers on four critical issues that are especially relevant in 2020: (1) immigration; (2) political disenfranchisement; (3) racial and ethnic disparities in health; and (4) racism in the criminal justice system.
HESB 30373	Fracking, Water Wars, Deforestation of the Amazon, Droughts, Global Warming, Climate Change, Unsustainable Agriculture, Hurricanes, Pollution, Species Extinction, Invasive Species, Poaching, Overfishing, Depletion of Fossil Fuels, Overpopulation, Wastes, Ocean Acidification, Wildfires, Oil Spills, Overpopulation, Overconsumption, Land degradation - the list goes on!  These complex environmental problems are occurring constantly and rapidly; their consequences are global in scope and transcend national boundaries; and they embody the complex relationship between humans and the natural environment. This course is about developing an interdisciplinary understanding of the relationship between humans (society) and the environment. We will examine the historical and contemporary environmental challenges of global concern, the underlying role of humans, and attempts by society to address, mitigate, and adapt to such complex problems through policies, institutions, and governance. We will pay attention to the roles of different state and non-state actors in environmental policy making. Overall, students will draw from both the social and natural sciences to develop a deeper understanding of how society - through consumption, culture, politics, power, ethics, values, economic growth, location, etc - contribute to, or solve, environmental problems.
HESB 30375	This course will focus on the writings of Black political thinkers in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. Through critical examination of the conditions against, and contexts within, which the political theories of these thinkers are situated, this course hopes to arrive at some understanding of the principles, goals and strategies developed to contest and redefine notions/concepts of citizenship (vis-a-vis the imperatives of race/racism and the global colonial formations), humanity, justice, equality, development, democracy, and freedom.
HESB 30389	Social Entrepreneurship has sparked dialogue and debate for two decades. Its very definition is much debated, as well as its capacity to create sustainable, scalable, systems-changing impact. This course explores the theoretical concepts, practices and strategies associated with the dynamic discipline of social enterprise and innovation. For our purposes, social entrepreneurship is the landscape, of which paradigm-shifting solutions like microfinance, MSME (Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise) development, bottom of the pyramid, fair trade, impact investing, and the like, are components. This course will study many of these concepts, focusing on their opportunity for social impact, and as a vehicle for wealth creation in vulnerable and disenfranchised communities across the globe. Further, the course covers examples of various social enterprise models (for-profit, non-profit, hybrid), requiring students to analyze and devise strategies to improve the efficacy of these ventures. Finally, the course engages students in research seeking to advance the field of social entrepreneurship at the Keough School of Global Affairs and Notre Dame.
HESB 30391	The application of artificial intelligence is expanding rapidly and has the potential to reshape many fields, including transportation, finance, health care, marketing, social media, criminal justice, and public policy, just to name a few. AI's ability to predict human preference and behavior or even substitute human judgement in these fields creates opportunities as well as concerns for safety, bias and discrimination, transparency, inequality, and job loss. Designed to serve students from no background in AI to those who have existing technical background, this course surveys current and emerging applications of AI in different fields and the related ethical issues and governance problems. The course targets students from different disciplines. Students from the humanities and social sciences will gain a deeper understanding of the technical aspects underpinning today's ethical and policy debates related to AI. Students with more technical background will better appreciate the ethical issues that arise in programming and engineering and understand how technology interacts with the broader societal contexts. The course's goal is to encourage students to become proactive in thinking of the societal implications of technological change and to incorporate such understanding in their education and careers.
HESB 30398	This course is the seminar version of 30150. In this course we will discuss the relationship between economics and Catholic social teaching. We will learn about key principles in Catholic social thought, read key Papal encyclicals and other writings. We will then discuss key economic concepts and empirical facts known from the field of economics, and how these relate to Catholic social teaching. Finally, we will apply these ideas to discussions on labor, capital, finance, the environment, globalization, and development
HESB 30399	In the past four decades, the United States has experienced an unprecedented rise in income and wealth inequality. Inequalities across multiple other dimensions (race, ethnicity, geography, and gender) are also pervasive. This course examines a multitude of questions related to politics, policy, and varieties of inequality.  How has the American political system and the policies it produces affected levels of inequality in the U.S.? How has inequality shaped American politics and policy? What is the relationship between income and power? What are the political consequences of increasing income inequality? What are the implications of racial and ethnic inequities for the quality of democratic representation? Which policies increase political inequality? What are effective remedies for unequal influence? Finally, which institutions move democratic practice furthest towards full democratic equality and which ones serve to reinforce historical hierarchies? This course is designed to help students understand the political causes and consequences of inequality in America and consider potential interventions to support human flourishing for all.  The course will be organized as a reading-focused seminar, with a combination of discussion and lecture rooted in cutting-edge scholarly research and evidence-based public commentary. Students will develop a substantial final research project that will be presented to an audience beyond the classroom.
HESB 30410	The course will examine U.S. policies and practices to combat human trafficking including how U.S. policies advance the prevention of trafficking in persons, the protection of victims and survivors and the punishment of perpetrators as a foreign policy objective of the U.S.  Students will develop a basic understanding of the various aspects of and perspectives in human trafficking including domestic and international law; foreign nationals and United States Citizens; victim services, survivor aftercare and law enforcement and sex and labor trafficking. Students will also analyze international trafficking prohibitions under the various international conventions and identify current trafficking issues in the United States, with a particular focus on commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor and involuntary servitude and the range of remedies available when rights have been violated.  Finally, students will identify gaps in existing remedies and formulate policies to address them.
HESB 30421	This course introduces students to the dynamics of the social and historical construction of race and ethnicity in American political life. The course explores the following core questions: What are race and ethnicity? What are the best ways to think about the impact of race and ethnicity on American citizens? What is the history of racial and ethnic formation in American political life? How do race and ethnicity link up with other identities animating political actions like gender and class? What role do American political institutions the Congress, presidency, judiciary, state and local governments, etc. play in constructing and maintaining these identity categories? Can these institutions ever be used to overcome the points of division in American society?
HESB 30436	This course will examine ways that law structures, promotes, and governs the practice of democracy in America. Topics include key features of the American constitution, including federalism, bicameralism, the separation of powers, and judicial review; the First Amendment and the freedoms of speech and press; voting rights, elections, parties, and campaigns; and the changes caused and challenges posed by technological and other developments.
HESB 30443	This course will examine the many ways in which religion has been fused into American politics. In doing so, we will also explore the rising tide of secularism in the United States, which many argue has resulted from a backlash to the fusion of religion and conservative politics. Then it will turn to trying to solve the puzzle of America's religious pluralism—if religion is so politically divisive, why are Americans so accepting of (most) religions other than their own? What explains the exceptions to that acceptance? What are the implications of a secularizing America for religious pluralism?
HESB 30473	This course covers the main developments in American foreign policy from World War II through the end of the Cold War.  The principal topics of investigation will be wartime diplomacy and the origins of the Cold War; the Cold War and containment in Europe and Asia; Eisenhower/Dulles diplomacy; Kennedy-Johnson and Vietnam; Nixon-Kissinger and détente; Carter and the diplomacy of Human Rights; Reagan and the revival of containment; Bush and the end of the Cold War.
HESB 30537	This course provides an introduction to urban economics, focusing on both contemporary and historical issues in the United States. Topics include location decisions of households and firms, agglomeration economies, housing and zoning policy, suburbanization, local governments, and segregation. Students will use economic models, data analysis, and academic articles to study these topics.
HESB 30638	Although the mass media is not formally part of the U.S. government, it is arguably the most powerful institution shaping public attitudes, creating and producing information, and communicating political information to individual citizens.  Almost all exposure to politics comes not from direct experience but from mediated stories. And, with the rise of the Internet, the growth of 24-hour cable news, and the decline of the &quot;Big Three&quot; television networks has created, a more diffuse media environment has been created. The primary purpose of this course is to analyze the role of the media in American politics and its relationship with the public, government, and candidates for office in a democratic society.
HESB 30639	This seminar-style course will examine foundational questions of constitutional order. We will begin from debates about the nature of political society among contemporary thinkers, Jurgen Habermas, Pope Benedict, John Rawls, and Carl Schmitt. We will then focus on key Ancient, Medieval, and Modern thinkers: Aristotle, Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and the Federalist writers. Our aim will be to attain clarity about the questions that are fundamental to every constitutional order, especially the character of our &quot;original&quot; or pre-political condition, the status of war and peace, the nature of political authority and law, and the proper ends of political community.
HESB 30658	Set against the first midterm elections of the Trump presidency, this course is an updated introduction to the political and lawmaking dynamics of the United States Congress. Once defined by pork-barrel spending, powerful committee chairmen, and limited competition, Congress is now dominated by gridlock and partisan warfare. The traditional legislative process appears to have collapsed as an avenue for policymaking, and Congress is now by far the least popular political institution in America. This course investigates how Congress is supposed to work, whether it ever actually worked that way, and what changed, bringing us to the biggest question: how it works - or doesn't work - today.
HESB 30951	This interdisciplinary research lab enlists students in the efforts of the Just Wage Initiative (JWI), a collaborative research and advocacy project of the Higgins Labor Program at the Center for Social Concerns. Students will help develop, refine, and update the Just Wage Framework, a multistakeholder online tool designed to advance a more inclusive and equitable economy. Students will also undertake research projects connecting their own intellectual interests and disciplinary expertise to the JWI's foundational question: What makes any given wage just or unjust? In addition, students will collaborate with the instructor and local, national, and international practitioners to envision and execute collaborative research and advocacy campaigns to promote a just wage economy. Extended weekly class sessions will feature visits by scholars and activists, as well as facilitate interactive group discussions and collaborative experiments.
HESB 33104	This course offers an overview of the interaction between Catholics and public life in America during the half century following the Second Vatican Council and the election of a Catholic as President in 1960. The course should permit students to gain a greater familiarity with the engagement and response of various Catholic individuals and groups on some major political and social-cultural issues. It will explore the extent of Catholic influence in American politics and society during the period and will explore the role of religion in shaping (or not shaping) the outlooks of a number of significant Catholic political figures beginning with JFK, RFK, and Eugene McCarthy, moving to Mario Cuomo and Daniel Patrick Moynihan down to contemporary figures. The course offers each student the opportunity to research and write a major paper on a topic of his or her choosing in this area.
HESB 33903	This course is not for the faint of heart, but will explore the feint, adept, and deft use of Civics and History courses to try and create one ideal American narrative in K-12 classrooms. History in American K-12 classrooms and beyond is always political! Historical thinking is also supposed to be an active way of learning and establishing new ideas when there are new pieces of information or additional epistemologies not a passive regurgitation of facts. Join this class to struggle with how a more representative curriculum might help foster better-rounded citizens and broader critical thinking skills. Historical narratives created and true are installed in American curricula to create ‘good citizens,' but who determines what ‘good' is and who and what ‘citizens' are is an ever-changing pantheon of characters seeking god-like power over the nation's past, with aspirations of helping shape and control the nation's future. This course examines how historical events are molded and taught in curricula in different eras and shows the evolution of textbooks and curriculum firsthand. Students explore how early textbooks think of Native peoples as &quot;Noble Savages&quot; and how that ‘nobility' disappears in later texts. We'll have the opportunity to study the re-shaping of ethnic identities in the United States History curriculum and how the Cold War not only re-configures the size and orientation of the maps in our history books but also how the stories of other nations and their forms of government become commonplace slurs as a way to whip up righteousness for US policies in the Cold War and to quash rising ideologies connected to labor movements and those other nations simultaneously. We'll examine the rise and righteousness of both sides of the current debate over Critical Race Theory in the K-12 classroom and so much more. You will have the opportunity to explore additional historical narratives of Native peoples and many different groups who immigrants by choice, force, and forced annexations and their representations in curricula. This course recognizes the privileges that race, class, and gender has played in creating the historical narrative for K-12 classrooms through the study of the groups who make decisions about what civics and historical lessons are taught to students in American schools in different eras. This course will have writing and research elements go through multiple drafts and the final version of student works is not just academic in nature but is to demonstrate that you can utilize your knowledge and understanding for the good, to in essence show ‘what you are fighting for' in the parlance of all at Notre Dame working to bring academic thinking to the forefront for the common good. This course will require critical thinking, creative solutions and ideas on curricular philosophy, great classroom participation, a willingness to do original historical research, and a tremendous desire to share.
HESB 40104	Scholars and activists use the concept of the &quot;carceral state&quot; to describe the official, government use of policing, surveillance, and mass imprisonment to exercise control over society. This course examines the histories, cultures, politics, and economics of prisons and policing in the United States, in order to determine how the U.S. carceral state has been a factor in the social construction of race, gender, and citizenship. We will study the genealogy of the U.S. carceral state -- beginning with the surveillance embedded in the earliest practices of slavery and settler colonialism, tracing its development through the 19th and early 20th centuries, and concluding with the rise of the modern prison industrial complex. We will then focus on contemporary U.S. prisons, policing, and surveillance, using case studies including the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; immigrant detention, sex-crime regulation, and police violence. Finally, we will consider alternatives to prisons and policing, as we learn about academic research and activist movements working to end state and police violence, abolish prisons, and create opportunities for restorative justice.  Over the course of the semester, students will learn about the historical development and ongoing maintenance of the carceral state, using an intersectional framework that highlights the ways in which prisons and policing have both shaped, and been shaped by, race, gender, citizenship, and economics. Along the way, students will ask and address such questions as: How does the U.S. carceral state function as a tool for social control? What histories, policies, and ideologies underlie the carceral state? How have individuals and organizations worked to transform or abolish the carceral state? How have art and cultural production been used to normalize and/or critique the carceral state? And can we imagine a world without prisons or police?
HESB 40112	Students, in a structured format, are involved in assessing, prioritizing and creatively solving problems encountered by low-income and other disadvantaged South Bend entrepreneurs. A process consulting approach is employed and a number of useful tools and frameworks are introduced. Students work with both for-profit and non-profit enterprises, producing tangible deliverables that help clients launch, grow and sustain their ventures.
HESB 40115	At a moment when global challenges—from climate change to inclusive development to public health threats—loom large, many nation-states seem unable to come together to address them. In what ways are the world's cities and subnational governments working on their own and in concert to meet these challenges? This course examines the distinctive roles and capacities of cities, provinces, and states in managing global policy issues and explores different modes of trans-local cooperation and coordination. We start by considering the global governance shortcomings of nation-states and exploring the multilevel character of key policy challenges. We next use case studies from different issue-areas to assess how action by subnational governments is contributing to but also complicating solutions. We conclude by discussing the limitations of subnational approaches to global challenges and considering the most appropriate policy roles and portfolios for subnational actors in the 21st century To enable screen reader support, press Ctrl+Alt+Z To learn about keyboard shortcuts, press Ctrl+slash   
HESB 40118	Although advances in science and technology have made tremendous gains in promoting health and longevity, these achievements have not been experienced evenly. Instead, devastating health and disability-based inequities persist, such as environmental racism and disability-based discrimination. As a result, social movement groups and organizations are fighting to protect vulnerable communities and promote civil rights. This class will therefore address how social movements have impacted the health and human rights of vulnerable social groups in the US and beyond today. To do so, we will (1) use a sociological perspective to investigate the structural determinants of health and the social construction of disabilities, and (2) investigate how advocates, activists, and organizations fight for good health and disability justice. This course will require participation in a daylong multi-fieldsite visit, weekly readings, presentations, and a final paper.
HESB 43546	This course undertakes a broad examination of black politics in multiracial America. Racial issues have provoked crises in American politics; changes in racial status have prompted American political institutions to operate in distinctive ways. The course examines the interface of black politics with and within the American political system. How successful have blacks been as they attempted to penetrate the electoral system in the post civil rights era. What conflicts and controversies have arisen as African Americans have sought to integrate the American system of power. Now that the laws have been changed to permit limited integration, should African Americans integrate politically, that is should they attempt to 'deracialize' their political appeals and strategy, with an effort to &quot;crossover politically;&quot; are some approaches such as those of President Barack Obama &quot;not black enough?&quot; What internal political challenges do African Americans face; some such as the increasing importance of class and socioeconomic factors, as well as gender and sexuality may reshape the definition of the black community. What intellectual challenges and strategic choices are they facing as the American population has grown increasingly multiracial. Finally, in light of these demographic changes in American life and American politics, how stable will past patterns of political participation, and political organizations and institutions of African American politics remain.
HESB 43585	Sociologists who study social movements and activism typically address questions about how disadvantaged groups are able to organize and engage in sustained protest in hopes of bringing about progressive change. In recent years, however, we have witnessed the growth of many organizations that aim to prevent change with hopes of preserving benefits that they enjoy. To understand this form of organized resistance to change, we need to closely examine how power operates in society to understand conditions that give rise to activism that resists progressive change. We consider the extent to which theories designed to explain progressive activism fail to account for conservative activism. The ultimate goal for the course is to provide you with the tools needed to formulate your own research questions and to engage with the academic literature to theorize your questions in a way that could lead to publishable research.
HESB 43787	Given the dramatic rise in mass incarceration over the last 50 years, understanding the spillover consequences of this uniquely American phenomenon has become increasingly important as a growing number of families now have direct experience with imprisonment. This course will provide a broad overview of the ripple effects of mass imprisonment on family life and how it shapes opportunity and structures disadvantage for communities, families, and especially children. This will be done through 1) exposure to mixed-media portrayals of imprisonment's effects on family and community life and 2) the close analysis of empirical research on the spillover and intergenerational consequences of incarceration across a range of outcomes. With the concentration of imprisonment falling among poor, minority families, much of the readings in this course will focus on family life in urban communities of color, however, we will spend a little time exploring broader accounts, including those of rural communities and encourage students to consider impacts for families exposed to incarceration due to white-collar crimes.
HESB 43889	This course will examine the opportunities and challenges facing Latino communities today as they simultaneously transform and are transformed by their continuing growth in U.S. society. Through a careful examination of the biographies of leaders in Latino communities, we will examine what role they have each played in empowering Latino communities to advance in business, arts, education, community organizing, entertainment, medicine, religion, law, academia, politics, and other areas. The course will coincide with the Transformative Latino Leadership Speaker Series sponsored by the Arthur Foundation through the Institute for Latino Studies. Students in the class will have the opportunity to interact with invited leaders in several setting including the classroom, meals, receptions, and university-wide events. The primary course requirement is a research essay about the life and career of a chosen leader.
HESB 48000	This course offers students an opportunity to pursue an independent capstone research project. Students will choose a faculty member that will guide them through the semester-long research, including producing a final research note or policy memo. Interested students should speak with the Hesburgh Program in Public Service academic advisor to obtain approval.
HHS 10115	The course will provide a survey of relationships between man and microorganisms. General information about microbial physiology, biochemistry, and ecology will support more detailed discussions of interesting topics in food, medical, and applied microbial biology. Included will be subjects of general and historical interest, as well as current newsworthy topics. The student should get a better understanding of the role of microorganisms in disease, the production of common foods, relevant environmental issues, and biotechnology. This course counts as general elective credit only for students in the College of Science.
HHS 20188	This writing-intensive course will immerse students in the rich literary tradition of physician-writers by inviting them to engage in the practice of life writing (personal essay, memoir, diary, journal keeping, and oral history) in response to their experiences as patients, as caregivers, and as aspiring medical professionals pursuing a variety of majors (in the Sciences and Humanities) at the University. In addition to regular creative prompts, students will write analytically and critically in response to work by a diverse list of medical professionals, patients, and caregivers from the last 100 years. Special focus will be placed on the ways writing aids in the development of a sense of personal ethics, and how the practice of writing can be used as a therapeutic tool. The course will cover a wide range of genres and texts from the late 19th century to the present, with an emphasis on writings where the author is engaged in self-analysis, reflection on class, privilege, difference, and advocacy.
HHS 20311	What are the cultures of medicine? How does belief create possibilities for healing? How do cultural, social, and political forces shape experiences of illness? When can care be a form of violence? How can histories of oppression make you sick? Medical anthropology is an expansive field of research concerned with the study of medicine, affliction, and healing in historical and cultural context. This course provides an introduction to topics in medical anthropology, from classical texts on belief, illness experience, and structural violence to contemporary work on disability, care, and critical global health. Over the course of the semester, students will gain experience in methods, critical thinking, independent research, and public communication as we collectively explore what medical anthropology can contribute to the urgent health challenges that we face in the contemporary world today.
HHS 20555	This seminar examines a number of important topics in medicine and society today, including shared health responsibility, race and class-based inequities, vaccinations, opioid crisis, beginning and end-of-life care, organ donation and body modification, health of imprisoned populations, mental health of healthcare providers, and health in the age of social media. Students in this class will gain an understanding of the ethical, social, and practical dimensions of a variety of healthcare and health policy issues and how providers navigate these dimensions in their care. A key part of the class is the opportunity for students to engage directly with healthcare workers who will serve as guest speakers. The seminar will emphasize writing and journaling, and will directly integrate matters of health care with broader humanistic and social science approaches to health, wellbeing, the body, etc. to deepen students' understandings of what medicine is.  This is a core course in the Health, Humanities, and Society minor
HHS 20556	We all recognize that the biomedical sciences change rapidly, but amid the seemingly intractable and interminable debate about healthcare reform in the US, it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that the same is true of the healthcare system. This interdisciplinary course will examine the American healthcare system in historical and comparative perspective. We look at its institutional structure, its professional composition, and its governance at various levels, with the end learning objective being to understand how these facets of the healthcare system shape not only national health outcomes, but also provider and patient experience. The course draws on the history, sociology and anthropology of medicine, and serves as one the core courses in the new Health, Humanities and Society Minor.  
HHS 20557	Science and technology play a powerful role in structuring our world, in everything from our physical environment to our culture. It is thus imperative that we understand how these entities work. What constitutes reliable knowledge? How do the technological systems in which we are embedded throughout our lives come to be, and how can they be changed? In this historic moment of a global pandemic playing out against a backdrop of fake news, alternative facts and increasingly autonomous technologies, these questions are more critical than ever. This course introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of Science &amp; Technology Studies in order to provide them with analytical and conceptual tools needed to confront the complex questions that arise where science and society intersect. Its objective is thus not so much to present a particular body of empirical information as it is to equip students with the analytical skills to understand complex multi-dimensional phenomena. The purpose is to give students both the opportunity and the tools to consider science and technology in a broader political, social, historical and economic context, and to reflect on how the practices of scientific and technological development shape their own individual and collective experience.
HHS 20601	Measurement is a fundamental activity in modern science, both the natural and social sciences. While measurement is often considered as the hallmark of science that makes an activity “scientific,” there is little consensus among philosophers about how to define measurement, what kinds of things are measurable, or which conditions make measurement possible. By engaging with texts that build on concrete practices of measurement in historical and contemporary case studies, we will collectively explore questions such as: How do we know that an instrument, such as a thermometer, measures the quantity it is intended to measure? How are measurement units established, and how do they vary across different fields of science and culture? What does it mean to measure human attributes, such as feeling, if possible at all? Our journey begins with in-depth discussions on accuracy and precision, calibration, and standardization—the foundational concepts that make measurement possible. We then navigate the diverse landscape of philosophical viewpoints on measurement, encompassing operationalism, conventionalism, and realism. With these concepts and perspectives in mind, we will explore more case studies across various scientific domains, ranging from the physical and biological sciences to clinical medicine and social sciences, where you will discover issues more closely related to your own field of study. In the course, you will bring and elaborate your own case study related to your specific interests or fields of study. This case study serves as a focal point for actively applying concepts and approaches learned throughout the course, which will eventually crystallize into your final paper. From the course, you will come to see measurement not merely as a technical process but as a complex epistemic activity that demands critical examination, from experimental design to data interpretation. No prior background in specialized sciences is necessary to enroll in this course.
HHS 20806	We are living through a watershed moment in United States history. Structural racism is at the forefront of the national discourse. Yet, the threat that racism holds on our nation's most cherished ideals of democracy and justice is hardly new. Generations of activists, scholars, and everyday people have fought and persevered to bring about social, cultural, and policy change.  This course engages deeply with topics relevant to the national discourse on racial and ethnic relations in the U.S. The first part of the course examines key concepts, focusing on the social construction of race and ethnicity, prejudice, and discrimination. The second part reviews the historical experiences of Native Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans. The third and final part of the course centers on four critical issues that are especially relevant in 2020: (1) immigration; (2) political disenfranchisement; (3) racial and ethnic disparities in health; and (4) racism in the criminal justice system.
HHS 25000	The current generation of colleges students will face a host of challenges in their lifetimes, including a global population that will potentially reach 9 billion by the early 2040s, depleting resources, and declining ecosystems. Additionally, the world is currently experiencing the worst global pandemic it has faced in over a century, whose effects will linger for years to come while foreshadowing the potential impact of other impending shocks. If current economic growth continues in a &quot;business as usual&quot; framework, future generations will face an increased dearth of decent jobs, growing social divisions, and devastating threats to the environment. This course will explore this confluence of issues and help students to consider a new roadmap for economic development and human flourishing that respects the dignity of every individual and the environment. Readings and lectures will look at the intersection of economic growth, industry, food security, water scarcity, health, religion, innovation science, and climate change. Case studies and real world examples will link theory to policy and practice. A major component of this course will be in-class discussions and case studies that will push students to think critically and debate the important questions within the study of sustainable development. The objective of these discussions will be to a) explore the interconnectedness of many of these issues and their varying degrees of impact on the wealthy, the middle class, and the poor or marginalized; b) understand different models of governance at international, national, and local levels that are trying to work through these issues; and c) bridge theory to policy and practice. This course requires active student participation in class as well as group projects and quizzes to gauge how well students are absorbing the material.
HHS 30113	With help from athletes such as Billie Jean King, Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James, Serena Williams, and Megan Rapinoe, Americans are growing accustomed to thinking about sports as embedded in the politics of gender, class, race, sexuality, and the nation. Consider the variety of places where sports happen, however, and the ways we develop and consume those places, and it becomes apparent that sports are also environmental in significant and complex ways. This course will examine the environmental politics of sports from conservation to climate change through the lenses of history and cultural studies. Course content will range from 19th century hunting, Indigenous surfing, and BASE jumping, to pick-up basketball, pro stadiums, and Notre Dame Athletics. Topical sections include outdoor sports and conservation, mountain sports and public land use, parks and recreation, stadiums and environmental justice, sports and climate change, and sustainability in the NCAA. Course requirements include regular reading and discussion, midterm and final essays, and a research project on a topic of the student's choice.
HHS 30117	Inflammation is a fundamental biological phenomenon - whether it preserves or destroys is often a matter of context. In this course, we focus specifically on neuroinflammation - i.e., inflammation as it relates to the central (and peripheral) nervous system. We begin with the founding principles of molecular and cellular immunology in the context of the human nervous system. Next, we will explore the biological, environmental, and human components of (neuro)inflammatory disease through clinical case studies and representations in literature and media. Finally, we ask: how do medical, healthcare, and pharmaceutical constructs define the sociocultural experience of disease? Thus in this class, we integrate the scientific and the social: How do humans, how does humanity at large, deal with (neuro)inflammation? Can we firefight our collective future? This course is open to all majors. Strongly recommended prerequisites: Biology I: Big Questions (BIOS10171) OR Neuroscience and Behavior (BIOS20450) OR Cell Biology (BIOS30341) OR Cellular Biology: Stem Cells to Disease (BIOS30410)
HHS 30123	If you were to perform a Google image search of “human evolution,” you would see endless pictures of men linearly evolving from apes to modern humans. These overwhelmingly one-sided depictions are because much of our human evolutionary story has been written by and about men to the exclusion of women. Consequently, many of the key theories explaining the unique suite of human features seem to assume that evolutionary forces act only upon men, and women are merely passive beneficiaries. Not only is this exclusion of roughly half the population sexist, it is also bad science – bad science that to this day has been repeated and perpetuated to justify the status quo. In this class, we will explore human evolution from a feminist perspective intellectually drawing upon human biology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, primatology, exercise physiology, and reproductive health to demonstrate that women were and still are a driving force in human evolution. Using non-traditional learning methods and assignments, we will cover: 1) foundational feminist human evolutionary theory, 2) the pervasiveness of estrogen, 3) physical/athletic performance and sexual division of labor; 4) the significance and frequency of alloparenting; 5) multiple orgasms and the control of women’s sexuality; 6) cooperation and competition among women; 7) concealment (or not) of human ovulation; 8) evolutionary reasons for the difficulty of human birth; 9) the physical and mental resilience of women; and 10) the crucial role grandmothers and menopause. It is my hope that this class not only provides an alternative perspective to current thinking in human evolution, but also encourages students to bring their experiences and perspectives to bear. Because who asks the questions matters, and a greater diversity of views can only improve and enrich our holistic understanding of human evolution.
HHS 30154	The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 26% of Americans (about 61 million people) have a disability—a physical, intellectual, sensory, or self-care impediment that affects major life activities. This course considers this population, their stories and experiences, as well as how disability—as a social, cultural, legal, and political construct—has shaped the nation and its history. A particular focus of the course will be on disability and social justice. Throughout American history, and still today, disabled people have been excluded from basic civil rights, such as voting, marrying, holding property, and living independently. This course will examine how these restrictions developed and changed over time as well as how disabled people have fought for greater access and equality. Coursework may include response papers, primary source analysis, and a final project
HHS 30456	Between the early rumblings of the Reformations and the last cannon shot of World War I, Europeans profoundly changed how they conceptualized bodies as experience and metaphors. During these four centuries, Europeans grounded the ways in which they interacted with each other and the world in bodily imaginings. On an individual level, the living, human body provided a means of accessing and understanding the material or spiritual world. On a collective scale, the physical body, its adornments, and its gestures provided markers that Europeans used to fracture society along axes of gender, sexuality, class, race, mental aptitude, and even sacrality. Drawing in part from their myriad imaginings of the human body, Europeans constructed metaphorical political bodies. The body politic assumed diverse forms spanning from divine right monarchs to revolutionary republics to modern nation states. Our course will lay bare the human body as culturally constructed, while fleshing out how Europeans' evolving visions affected political imaginings.
HHS 30541	In an age where ‘identity politics’ figures as both an accusation and a creed in public and private spaces, a careful and critical examination of how we construct our individual and collective selves is more important than ever. Science and technology are crucial resources in these projects, serving as fundamental structuring elements of our world. They are crucial in shaping not only our physical environment but the very conditions of possibility within which we construct our collective and individual identities. This course is an exploration of the ways that the practice of science and the production and marketing of technology supply the material that gets taken up in the project of identity formation, focusing on two closely linked technoscientific domains: neuroscience and genetics.
HHS 30550	Over the last two decades, there has been a groundswell of interest in global health across multiple disciplines and professional fields. The field of global health recognizes the multidimensionality of health as well as the interconnectedness of everyone living in the world today; its primary goal is to eliminate health disparities to achieve health equity for all. This course will provide foundational knowledge necessary to understand what global health is today; its history and evolution; how social theory contributes to understanding specific global health problems; the importance of understanding health and designing interventions by using a biosocial model that includes a myriad of cultural, social, political, economic factors; and an understanding of the role of various actors on the global health stage including international, bilateral, and civil society organizations.
HHS 30701	This course will provide an overview of communication concepts and strategies that can shape health practices and promote public health goals. You will become familiar with theories, communication channels, and some social and cultural complexities to consider in the design and analysis of persuasive health communication materials.
HHS 33022	In ancient and medieval texts the soul is the principle of life, of sense-perception, emotions, passions, rational thought and ethical behavior. Throughout history, the investigation of the soul has been special in two ways. First of all, we are not addressing an external topic; we are treating ourselves. Secondly, this study of ourselves is not merely meant to describe and analyze, but to change and to form. Ancient philosophers thought of their work as &quot;care of the soul&quot;. The soul is not a mechanism or machine, but something living which can err and go wrong. Pre-modern authorities often described this in the terms of sickness: The body may be sick and need the help of the doctor, and the soul may need therapy if it is sick.In the course, we will address a selection of texts and topics from ancient and medieval sources (Plato, Aristotle, Galen, the Stoics, Neoplatonic authors and Christian authors from late Antiquity and the Middle Ages), and compare them with select contemporary texts. What constitutes a healthy soul? What are the sicknesses of the soul? What therapies are recommended? How can one build resilience and how much resilience is right? What role does gender play? The course will also integrate lectures/discussions with practicing therapists and a field trip to &quot;mindworks&quot; (Chicago Museum of cognitive psychology).
HHS 33101	By helping us step back to see humans as primates, mammals, vertebrates, and beyond, evolutionary theory provides a framework for understanding many aspects of our day-to-day lives that shape the health and well-being, including weight gain-diet, psychosocial stress, immune function, sleep patterns, risky behavior, and child development. But, increasing evidence from the exciting field of &quot;developmental origins of health and disease&quot; suggests that our biological and behavioral patterns are far from being determined solely by our genes. Our early life contexts, from before birth, and possibly even the experiences of our parents and grandparents in prior generations influence how our brains and biological systems function, including how genes are expressed, and thus impact our health and behavior. This course will bring these dynamic perspectives together to answer questions regarding why we get sick, how our bodies flexibly respond to the world around us, and the inheritances we receive from our ancestors.
HHS 33998	Traditional strategies to fight against poverty, inequality and climate change have proved ineffective in the last decades. New and creative solutions are required where cutting-edge technological innovation and multidisciplinary work serve the common good. In this course, you will explore the state of the art in AI business development and its ethical implications in relation to current global societal and environmental challenges. You will reflect on your individual role in society and develop critical thinking about the current socio-technical value system. Our readings will include original works of philosophers, economists and computer scientists as well as examples of state-of-the-art AI supported business and institutional projects. As a result of the readings and class discussions, you will acquire well-informed understanding about the implications of the AI Trustworthy principle of justice and fairness, including non-discrimination and avoidance of unfair bias. You will become aware of the potential for AI to contribute, if well managed, towards fairer and more sustainable societies as well as the dangers it entails to widen inequalities and aggravate the discrimination suffered by vulnerable communities. This is a hands-on course where you will be ideating and planning projects for the social good. I will accompany you in the development of business plans where ethics is the driver and AI is the key instrument. I will help you define your project idea in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Therefore, your projects will be designed to work towards mitigating poverty, reducing gender and race inequality, combating climate change, improving the sustainability of cities and communities, ensuring affordable and clean energy, achieving responsible consumption and production, improving the quality of education, providing better health and well-being services, ensuring decent work and economic growth or promoting peaceful and inclusive societies. The goal of the course is to encourage and support you, as new entrepreneurs and future leaders, to work in multidisciplinary teams and develop interdisciplinary skills, being able to take advantage of new technology to create and manage projects for ethics in action.
HHS 40207	Global health is an area of study, research and practice that focuses on achieving equity in health for all people worldwide. The health status of individuals and populations arise from a myriad of complex biological, social, economic, political, and environmental factors that operate synergistically. Through a social justice lens, we will examine how these factors shape health outcomes and how interventions must be developed that include addressing the root causes of inequity. We will use a case-based approach, focusing on specific health problems in several countries, including the United States. Cases will include a variety of themes including health disparities arising from stress-associated racial discrimination, the epidemiological transition from infectious to non-communicable diseases, and how the health effects of climate change disproportionately affect the most vulnerable
HHS 40409	A major source of conflict - increasingly so - is environmental issues; both climate change-related conflicts about (more and more scarce) resources as well as secondary conflicts (conflicts that arise because of the resource conflict, i.e. climate migrants) pose a major challenge to the planet. Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato Si has offered ways to think about an &quot;integral ecology&quot; that takes the environment, life on the planet, the human condition and culture seriously. The cry of the earth and the cry of the poor cannot be separated. Laudato Si has to be read against the background of the concept of &quot;Integral Human Development.&quot; This concept, inspired by the works of Joseph Lebret, OP, was introduced by Pope Paul VI in his encyclical Populorum Progressio (1967). It refers to &quot;the development of the whole person and the development of all persons.&quot; The course explores the connection (intersectionality) between peace, (integral) ecology, and (integral human) development. It will do so with in-class room teaching sessions and working with select case studies on integral ecology.
HHS 40555	Although advances in science and technology have made tremendous gains in promoting health and longevity, these achievements have not been  experienced evenly. Instead, devastating health and disability-based inequities persist, such as environmental racism and disability-based discrimination. As a result, social movement groups and organizations are fighting to protect vulnerable communities and promote civil rights. This class will therefore address how social movements have impacted the health and human rights of vulnerable social groups in the US and beyond today. To do so, we will (1) use a sociological perspective to investigate the structural determinants of health and the social construction of disabilities, and (2) investigate how advocates, activists, and organizations fight for good health and disability justice. This course will require participation in a daylong multi-fieldsite visit, weekly readings, presentations, and a final paper.
HHS 40590	Is it possible to think of the 21st century as a post-racial, post-feminist world? In her provocative 2012 study, Body as Evidence: Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender, Janell Hobson suggests that rather than having been eradicated, millennial hopes that the historical difficulties represented by race and gender have lost their significance in the present day are as far, if not even further away from the mark as they have ever been. For Hobson, policing the body, whether that be in terms of its race, its gender, or its sexuality, has remained paramount. &quot;[W]hile the early-twenty-first century discourse of 'postracial' and 'postfeminist' often declares the loss of meaning attached to race and gender,&quot; she argues, &quot;..the global scope of our media-reliant information culture insists on perpetuating raced and gendered meanings that support ideologies of dominance, privilege, and power.&quot; In Hobson's view, the body and how it is imagined rests at the center of such ideologies, pointing also to a number of crucial questions that become particularly important when considering the significance of race and gender through the lens of modernity. How might a reconsideration of race point also to a rethinking of gender and vice-versa? What does race actually mean? How does/can it alter the way we understand gender? Is it possible to think race beyond the idea of race? What might a new conception of race actually look like, and how might this influence our thinking on gender? How are the problems of race and gender intertwined, and how is/has the body been imagined in and through them? What can such questions tell us about today's racial and gendered realities, both inside and outside the university, both in the past and the present? This course takes a step backward to investigate these and other like questions in the context of the utopic impulse and its emphasis on the imagination in several 19th-century American authors whose work may be viewed as participating in a broad yet under-acknowledged vision of race, gender and Atlantic modernity that seeks to interrogate hierarchies of race and gender as these have been constructed and maintained within dominant ideologies. Grounding our analysis in a number of 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century political philosophical texts on law and utopia and drawing on insights from critical race theory, gender studies, feminist theory, theories of law and literature, and utopian studies, our goal will be to gain a more nuanced understanding of our racialized past and its troubled link to questions of gender both then and now, so that we may better hope to imagine - and reimagine - the shape of our collective democratic future in the 21st century's global community.
HHS 40825	This course examines the intersection of gender, health policy, and health care organization around the world. Gender is frequently a central contributing (though sometimes ignored) factor to people's health. Men and women have different biologies, and it thus stands to reason that their lives—social, economic, political, and biological—would have an effect on their health. What causes men to have different illnesses than women? What places one gender at greater risk for illness than the other? How do men and women across the world experience health policies? Are they affected and constrained by similar factors? How do their work lives affect their experiences with health? How is the body medically produced? How do poverty and development play a role in people's well-being? Through an inquiry-based approach, these and other topics will be addressed in this class.
HHS 43550	This course will use economic theory and empirical economic research to study the family. Topics will include household decision making; the determinants of marriage and fertility; how marriage, fertility, and family structure are related to other outcomes; and public policies that affect the family and family formation. Students will learn to read and evaluate empirical economic research. This is a writing-intensive seminar course.
HHS 43701	A detailed consideration of the central methodological and epistemological questions bearing on science.
HHS 43787	Given the dramatic rise in mass incarceration over the last 50 years, understanding the spillover consequences of this uniquely American phenomenon has become increasingly important as a growing number of families now have direct experience with imprisonment. This course will provide a broad overview of the ripple effects of mass imprisonment on family life and how it shapes opportunity and structures disadvantage for communities, families, and especially children. This will be done through 1) exposure to mixed-media portrayals of imprisonment's effects on family and community life and 2) the close analysis of empirical research on the spillover and intergenerational consequences of incarceration across a range of outcomes. With the concentration of imprisonment falling among poor, minority families, much of the readings in this course will focus on family life in urban communities of color, however, we will spend a little time exploring broader accounts, including those of rural communities and encourage students to consider impacts for families exposed to incarceration due to white-collar crimes.
HHS 43818	When people think about sexuality, they often adopt a biological view - seeing sexuality as &quot;driven&quot; by hormones and nature. This course adopts a different approach by viewing sexuality through the lens of sociology - as shaped by social processes, including social interaction, institutions, and ideologies. The course will focus on examining three sociological aspects of sexuality: 1) The social, historical, and cultural factors that shape sexual behaviors, desires, identities, and communities; 2) The ways in which sex and sexuality are constantly regulated and contested at multiple levels of society, including within families, schools, workplaces, and religious and political institutions; and 3) The sources, causes, and effects of sexual inequality. While our focus will be on sexuality, we will also study how other identities (including gender, race, class, religion, etc.) influence and affect it. Students will be encouraged to question their taken-for-granted assumptions about sex and sexualities and to formulate critical perspectives on issues pertaining to sexuality in today's public discourses. This course is sex-positive in that it assumes that knowledge about sexuality is empowering, not dangerous. The readings and discussions will be frank, and students will be assisted in developing a language for and comfort level with discussing a wide range of sexual topics in a respectful and sociological way. In the process, students will be challenged to improve their critical thinking, researching, writing, and public speaking skills.
HHS 45000	Race is a social construct. So why have scientists spent centuries trying to quantify, measure, and categorize people by race? From early anthropometry to the Human Genome Project, this course examines the production and embedding of race into scientific knowledge since the 18th century. Designed for students interested in the history of science and the production of scientific knowledge or those curious about the origins of scientific racism and racial inequality, this course is also well-suited for students pursuing careers in the health professions. By focusing on historical discourses on the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge of race, students will be able to: 1. Understand how race, racism, and racial inequality are embedded in scientific knowledge 2. Outline the various methodologies different fields of science have used to group people into races 3. Carefully evaluate scientific technologies for racial biases This is an upper level undergraduate and graduate seminar.
HHS 46497	Independent research or readings taken under the supervision of an HHS faculty member. An approved proposal for the research/readings will be filed with the HHS office. (In order to receive HHS credit, the student's proposal will need to be approved by the faculty member supervising the student's research/readings and by the director of the HHS program.)
HHS 48497	Undergraduates will conduct research or elaborated readings on a topic of interest.
HHS 49999	Students in the Health, Humanities, and Society (HHS) minor may choose to meet three credits of elective requirements by undertaking a senior capstone project. This capstone will give students an opportunity for sustained exploration of contemporary concerns in medical practice. Students who choose to engage in this opportunity must do the following: 1. Identify a faculty advisor who agrees to mentor them in the project. (This faculty advisor must confirm their participation by emailing the HHS Program Director, Prof. Smith-Oka, vsmithok@nd.edu). Faculty advisors can be drawn from the HHS Faculty Affiliates or from another department. 2. Identify a topic and research question that relates to topics within HHS. 3. Write the capstone (25-30 pages long), supported by the faculty mentor, during the Spring semester of their senior year. (Students already writing a senior thesis in their primary major can potentially also count it as part of the HHS requirements; in this case their work must be longer and larger in scope than a standalone research project would be in either department. Students in this situation must obtain pre-approval from their program adviser and their advising dean.) 4. Present their capstone (as a poster or talk) to the HHS community during the last week of the spring semester. Students interested in writing a senior capstone must consult with the HHS Program Director (Prof. Smith-Oka, vsmithok@nd.edu) by the Friday after Fall Break of their senior year. Before the end of the fall semester students must officially register for a three-credit undergraduate research course in HHS and identify their faculty mentor, who needs to provide an email describing the nature of the capstone to the HHS program director. The final draft of the capstone is due on the third Friday of April and must be sent to the student's capstone advisor and the HHS program director. The student's advisor is responsible for assigning the final grade in the course. Students can write their capstone based on any of the following options: A literature review of a topic of interest; an analysis of their experiences within an ISSLP or SSLP; an analysis and reflection of their experiences shadowing a clinician; or a research project based on empirical data the student has collected. The nature of the capstone and its empirical roots need to be part of the conversation between the student and their advisor.
HIST 13184	An introduction to the seminar method of instruction that explores the major methodologies of the historical discipline and which accents the organization and expression of arguments suggested by readings in historical topics.
HIST 20055	This course examines the history of the Middle East from the late eighteenth century to the Arab uprisings of 2011. We will approach cultural, social, political, and intellectual transformations in the Middle East. We will pursue a number of themes including engagements with modernity; reactions to Western colonial expansion; religious and secular reform movements; nationalism and revolution; changes in gender and family experiences; the Arab-Israeli conflict; the impact of oil and the Cold War; postcolonial state-building; the rise of political Islam and piety movements; globalization and economic disparities; and movements for democracy and social justice.
HIST 20203	This course examines the history of the Roman Empire, from the establishment of a veiled monarchy under Augustus to the Christianization of the empire following the reign of Constantine (ca. 1st century B.C. to 5th century A.D). Throughout the course, we will analyze and interpret ancient textual and archaeological evidence, from both Italy and the provinces, to assess the multi-faceted institutions and cultures of the Roman people. This body of material includes the writings of emperors (Augustus, Marcus Aurelius) and ancient historians (Tacitus, Suetonius, Ammianus Marcellinus), as well as the personal letters of Pliny to the emperor Trajan. Major themes discussed in the course include the nature of despotism, dynasties and the problem of succession; imperial governance of the Mediterranean (central, provincial, and local); cultural diversity and acculturation (so-called &quot;Romanization&quot;); religions and the imperial cult (worship of the Roman emperor); citizenship; urbanism, politics, and the economy; mortality and ecology; and the discrepant identities of women, children, slaves, freedmen, and freeborn under the imperial system of Rome.
HIST 20602	When speaking of the American Revolution, many writers reach for a comment made by John Adams in 1818 that, &quot;[T]he Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. . .&quot; Whether this assertion is true historically or not, it still does not adequately describe what that revolution was. The American Revolution obviously had its political elements, primarily the formation of the United States. To reach its political goals, military means were necessary. Without a successful War for Independence, there would have been no revolution. To leave matters there, however, would be insufficient. A fuller understanding of the revolution would need to address how it affected the whole spectrum of American life. It would consider the revolution as a social movement that challenged the political and social hierarchies of the day. It would also ask how the revolution affected those who were not white males, especially women, slaves, and Native Americans. Without considering the possible negative implications of the revolution, any telling would be incomplete. This class will take up these challenges and attempt to make a full-orbed presentation of the events surrounding the American Revolution. It will introduce students both to elites and to those whom the popular narrative glosses over. It will attempt to count the losses, as well as the gains, which flowed from the move to independence from Britain. Finally, it will attempt to describe the many changes through this period, which resulted, not only in a new political nation, but in a new society and culture--changes that in varying degrees are still with us today and of which contemporary Americans are the inheritors.
HIST 20902	This course will introduce students to the main topics, themes, and debates in Atlantic history, focusing on Spanish and Portuguese America and the Caribbean. It will begin with an overview of slavery and other legal and labor systems in West Africa and the Americas, and then examine how and why the Portuguese and Spanish entered into a slaving trade in West Africa, and what ensued from contact with the American hemisphere after 1492. We will end with abolition and emancipation in the Americas. Along the way we will examine the rise and fall of &quot;Indian,&quot; slavery, the cultural meanings of Blackness, the labor and economic conditions in urban settings as well as on rural plantations, and the strategies that enslaved people used to negotiate living conditions and achieve freedom. We will also pay careful attention to different kinds of resistance, including the formation of stable palenques of those who escaped slavery and a variety of rebellions, including the successful Haitian Revolution. Weekly readings will include modern accounts and historical documents. Assignments will predominantly be medium-length (5-7 pages) essays using primary sources and one exercise using the Transatlantic Slave Trade Database. We also hope to utilize the collections at the Raclin Murphy Art Museum.
HIST 20983	Food feeds culture. It nourishes societies as well as bodies. No discipline is intelligible without it. It provides economics with products, physiology with sustenance, social sciences with classes and relationships of power. and intellects with food for thought. Food´s also essential in ecology. Our most intimate contact with the environment occurs when we eat it. From interdisciplinary perspectives, we´ll approach the history of food in all cultures (including, by the way, those of non-human cultural creatures) in all periods that we can say something about, from the origins of carnivorism and cannibalism through famines and fushion to the food-related environmental problems of the future. There may even be time to explore cuisines.
HIST 20996	This course will explore the evolution of war in modern history from the fall of Constantinople in 1453 through the present. Content will center upon the relationship between war, technology and society. Central themes will include the military revolution debate, the rise of western Europe, the military origins of modern state, and the challenge of technological change to stable international orders. Students will learn how the evolving conduct of war has shaped the structure of modern societies, and vice-versa. Individual class sessions will explore important moments of conflict and technological innovation. Some class sessions will center on paradigm-defining conflicts, such as the Thirty Years' War or the Second World War. The course will conclude with explorations of new themes in modern warfare, from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to the rise of drone and cyber warfare. This course satisfies the university history requirement and is open to all students; no previous knowledge of the topic is required.
HIST 22085	 A required tutorial for students enrolled in HIST 20983 or its cross-lists.
HIST 22602	A required weekly tutorial for students registered for The American Revolution (HIST 20602 or its crosslists).
HIST 22902	A required tutorial for students enrolled in HIST 20902 or its cross-lists.
HIST 22996	A weekly tutorial required for students enrolled in HIST 10996 or HIST 30996, War in Modern History, or its cross-lists.
HIST 30056	This course will provide advanced undergraduates and graduate students with a critical introduction to digital humanities for the study of early China, the fountainhead of Chinese Civilization. Collaborating with the Center of Digital Scholarship, this course will focus on relational data with structured information on historical figures, especially high officials, of early Chinese empires. Throughout the semester, we will read academic articles, mine data from primary sources, and employ Gephi and ArcGIS to visualize data. Those constructed data will cover three major themes: how geographical mobility contributed to consolidating a newly unified empire over diversified regions; how social networks served as the hidden social structure channeling the flow of power and talents; and how criminal records and excavated legal statutes shed light on the unique understanding of law and its relationship with the state in Chinese history.
HIST 30059	What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films.  Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba).
HIST 30062	Popular perceptions of Africa are almost wholly defined by the last century and a half of its history, first under the boot of European imperial powers and then struggling to rebuild sovereignty and stability in the post-colonial world. Apart from the slave trade, most often narrated as an American story that happens to begin in Africa, little of the continent’s rich pre-modern past earns more than a passing mention in global history. This course aims to shine a spotlight on these neglected stories and examine the many contributions of Africans to the course of human history.  We will begin with Africa as the ancients knew it, a land of bright sunshine, proud empires, and legendary wealth. We’ll then examine the continent’s long history of trade with the wider world, both in goods and in people. Finally, we will consider the sources of the great upheavals that swept the continent in the 19th century and how they heralded the coming of colonization. Along the way, we will work with a wide range of sources, from legends and travelogues to fiction and film, in order to better appreciate the lives and perspectives of everyday Africans.
HIST 30089	Many Muslim thinkers and scholars have articulated the meaning and message of Islam in the modern period. This course will focus on one particular group of interpreters of Islam, namely the traditional or orthodox religious scholars called the Ulama and their institutions. This course will provide historical contexts in order to explore how traditional Muslims navigate the discourses of modernity and how they resist it. We will read original texts in translation and secondary sources of descriptions of representatives of the orthodox tradition in regions of Asia, the Middle East and in the West. The course will pay particular attention to the institutions of learning known as madrasas, jami` and hawzas. Of course, the orthodox views are challenged by other Muslims and some of those debates will also be channeled in the class while the focus will remain on the Ulama.  The course aims to equip students with analytical skills and the resources to understand how religious ideas impact religious communities and global affairs.
HIST 30092	This course examines the interplay between history, memory and violence in the modern the Middle East. We will discuss specific case studies of violence and war and their social, political and cultural dynamics of commemoration, forgetfulness and silence. The course will start with an overview of theories and concepts emanated from the field of Memory Studies and then continue with our case studies. These will include the Lebanese civil war (1975-1990), the 1948 war that led to the establishment of Israel and Palestinian displacement, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the violent regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, the Armenian genocide during World War I and the Algerian war of independence (1955-1962).
HIST 30094	India, Pakistan and Bangladesh account for more than a fifth of humanity: nearly two billion people in one of the most densely populated parts of the planet. South Asians speak more than a hundred languages, and represent most of the Hindus, Muslims, Sikh, Jains, and Zoroastrians in the world. The region's major economy, India, is by itself among the ten largest economies and one of the fastest growing. Yet, there is much about South Asia that can be perplexing. Caste based violence remains widespread in a society that is fast modernizing; billionaires mushroom alongside widespread malnourishment; space missions are launched to Mars amidst vast numbers of illiterate and uneducated citizens; Bollywood thrives while freedom of expression is often under threat; religious fundamentalism exists alongside extraordinary religious pluralism; gay rights expand alongside the murders of atheist bloggers; a democratic government lives in fear of military overthrow; a society that has that has chosen women as heads of state also sees increasing reports of sexual crimes. This course will unravel these knots and explain the processes that gave rise to them. Beginning in the middle of the twentieth century, this course will progress chronologically and bring us to the present day via themes on politics, economy, society, and popular culture. It offers an understanding of contemporary India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh and their place on the global stage.
HIST 30148	Whether it is controversies about the removal of statues, bans on teaching the New York Times’s The 1619 Project, critiques of the musical Hamilton, or originalist interpretations of the United States Constitution, early America seems to have gained new prominence in debates about the present-day United States. But why does this period—which spans four centuries from approximately 1450 to 1850—hold such meaning today? And what does this history have to teach us about our present moment? In this class, we will learn about the vast, diverse, and complex world of early America and use this knowledge to better understand current issues and events. Like Americans today, early Americans dealt with pandemics, racial injustice, political corruption, and economic inequality. They adapted to changing markets, globalization, and climate change. What do their experiences have to teach us about navigating these issues in our own time?
HIST 30177	America, at its core, is an idea. The lands that became America have been imagined and in certain ways and constantly reimagined. The history of the ideas that made America is less a lesson in philosophy and more about a series of clashes between contending visions: Democracy vs. Republicanism; Free vs. Slave; Christian vs. Secular; Individual vs. Society; and Universal vs. Particular. This course traces a long arc from the Puritans to the Culture Wars to understand the ideas Americans draw upon to comprehend the world and act in it.Lectures and discussions will consider the notions of equality, democracy, pluralism, religious freedom, and the tensions between contending visions for America. Readings for this course will include autobiographies, speeches, sermons, canonical texts, lyrics, novels, newspaper articles, and poetry.
HIST 30202	Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived side by side for centuries in the lands surrounding the Mediterranean throughout the Middle Ages - the occupied the same towns, shopped in the same markets, dwelt in the same neighborhoods, read each other's books, and borrowed each other's stories. While covering the broad sweep of Latin-Christian, Islamic, and Byzantine civilizations that grew up in the lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea after the fall of Rome, we will focus especially the on-going interactions between Jews, Christians, and Muslims in this area. While doing so we will constantly ask how can we know - and what kinds of things we can know - about the Middle Ages, as we examine many types of medieval sources, including literary works, historical texts, religious and philosophical writings, and works of art. The course lectures will provide the student with sufficient understanding of the medieval Mediterranean that they will be able to read with profit the assigned texts which are all primary sources, written in a variety of Mediterranean languages, in English translation. The course will proceed partly chronologically - especially when it comes to the politics and geo-politics of the region - and partly thematically.
HIST 30210	An introduction to the nature and influence of Roman law, one of the most celebrated and distinctive elements of ancient Roman culture. The course surveys the development of Roman civil law from the very early and enigmatic Twelve Tables to the very late and amazingly great Digest of Justinian. Topics covered include legal procedures, the creation of law, and Roman jurisprudence, all of which are studied in the broad context of Roman government and administration. The lasting effects of Roman law on modern legal systems are also considered.
HIST 30215	The purpose of this interdisciplinary course is twofold: to examine the social context and cultural change of the sixties and to explore the various journalistic and aesthetic representations of events, movements, and transformations. We will focus on the manner in which each writer or artist witnessed the sixties and explore fresh styles of writing and cultural expression, such as the new journalism popularized by Tom Wolfe and the music/lyrics performed by Bob Dylan. Major topics for consideration include the counterculture and the movement--a combination of civil rights and anti-war protest.
HIST 30217	This class analyzes the politics and cultures of remembrance in Europe from the late nineteenth century to today. Taking examples such as the politicization of Holocaust memory in Europe or the grassroots removal of monuments in Britain as points of departure, students will learn about processes of remembering and forgetting, and how memories of the past have shaped European identity and culture in the 20th and 21st centuries. We will pay particular attention to the mobilization and commemoration of Europe's traumatic pasts, including the World Wars, imperialism and decolonization, the Cold War, and histories of genocide, to investigate how Europeans have remembered these difficult histories and how these memories have shifted over time. We will look not only at how the traumatic past is represented today; but how memory work was enacted at the time and how Europeans have fought to revise these representations and demand new recognition of alternative visions of the past. In its focus on memory, broadly defined, this course will deeply explore how representations of the past have shaped European identity, culture, and politics both at the time and today.  In its focus on memory and memorialization, this class also attends to the visuality and material culture of history and historical research. Students will learn to read visual and material sources as sources akin to political tracts, diaries, and memoirs. We will engage with sources including photo albums, monuments, memorials, museum spaces, memorial landscapes, film, cultural kitsch, and art all as critical primary sources to understanding the production and circulation of memory. We will read foundational texts on collective memory and remembrance to understand how scholars and theorists have defined and conceptualized memory. Students will also conduct an original research project on a topic of their choosing by exploring a case study of memory work or collective memory in the context of Modern Europe.
HIST 30227	In the modern world, sports and sport-like spectacles are a source of livelihood, entertainment, and social interaction for huge swathes of the global population. Fans and practitioners of physical feats of strength were likewise a major component of ancient Greco-Roman society, from the earliest Olympic Games at the dawn of Greek history to the gladiatorial contests and chariot races that characterized the most decadent phases of the Roman Empire. The purpose of this course is to provide an interdisciplinary examination of the origin and nature of sport and spectacle in the Classical world and to compare the role that athletics played in ancient society to the position it occupies in our own lives - from the point of view of athletes, spectators, and patrons alike. Topics covered will include: Near Eastern precursors to Greco-Roman sport; the development of Greek and Roman sport and spectacle through time, the Olympic Games; the role of religious thought in ancient sport; the position of the athlete within society; ancient and modern rewards for athletic valor; athletes in architecture, literature, and art; and the political appropriation of athletes and athletics. The course will focus mostly on formal athletic contests in ancient Greece and on athletic spectacles in ancient Rome, but general recreation and physical education will be considered as well.
HIST 30267	This course will explore modern popular imaginings of the Middle Ages through film. We will view several feature-length films and numerous clips, interspersed with readings from and about the Middle Ages. Together we will discuss and analyze both the texts and films. The films will range from early silent films to Monty Python spoofs to recent blockbusters. I have divided the course into six segments:  (1) the Crusades; (2) Eleanor of Aquitaine: wife and mother of kings; (3) Robin Hood; (4) King Arthur; (5) the Black Death; and (6) Joan of Arc Students will write short daily assignments, two short essays, and a final paper or take-home exam. There are two required textbooks and a course packet. The textbooks are Robert Brent Toplin, Reel History: In Defense of Hollywood (2002); and Daniel Hobbins (trans.), The Trial of Joan of Arc.
HIST 30328	This course aims to accomplish the following: 1) to develop students' understanding of the Cold War and its major political developments; 2)  to develop students' understanding of the ways sports and society influence and reflect political developments; 3) to see sports programs as a reflection of the nation-states in which they develop, and to use athletic traditions in different nations to develop students' understanding of different societies; 4) to improve students' ability to use contemporary periodical sources in historical research; and 5) to improve students' analytical reading and writing skills through readings, exams, and a paper.
HIST 30341	This course explores the major developments in Byzantium and the Eastern Mediterranean from the time of the crusades and the eastward expansion of the Italian naval powers until the rise of the Ottoman Empire to a new universal power unifying the Balkan Peninsula and Asia Minor under the rule of a Muslim sultanate. The encounter between Latin and Greek Orthodox Christians in the wake of the crusade led to political rivalries and religious discord, culminating in the Latin conquest of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade of 1204. While the eastward expansion of Italian naval powers had already begun in the late eleventh century, it was mainly as a result of 1204 that Venice and, later on, Genoa became predominant political and economic factors in the Eastern Mediterranean, controlling much of the long-distance seaborne trade between Italy and the Syrian coast. The Anatolian Seljuk Turks initiated the gradual Turkification and Islamization of Asia Minor. In the thirteenth century, the Eastern Mediterranean endured increasing pressure from the Mongols and the Mamluk sultanate. One of the results of this development was the rise of the Ottoman principality to a leading political power incorporating large parts of the Balkan Peninsula and, in 1453, the city of Constantinople. We will discuss both socio-economic and political aspects of these developments.
HIST 30351	This course offers a chronological survey of Ireland and the Irish from the Act of Union with Great Britain to the present day. It will consider the social, political, religious, gendered, cultural and economic aspects of that history, and will place the island of Ireland within its wider contexts, as part of the United Kingdom, as part of Europe, as part of the British Empire, and as the source of the global Irish Diaspora. The course will focus on a number of central issues, including: how enduring sectarian divisions have influenced the development of Irish history; the Famine, mass emigration, and the rise of the Diaspora; the development and course of both Ulster and Southern unionism, and of Irish nationalism; the relationship of Ireland and the Irish to the British Empire and the wider Anglo-world; the Irish revolution, counter-revolution, and partition; the development of the Irish Free State, and Republic of Ireland; the history of Northern Ireland, the Troubles, and the peace process; the collapse of the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot;.
HIST 30352	This course looks at visions of church and Christian life in ecclesiology and spiritual theology from the Council of Trent to the present.
HIST 30375	"In <a href=""/search/?p=AD%201095"" data-action=""result-detail"" data-group=""code:AD 1095""  class=""notoffered"">AD 1095</a>, the Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Alexius Comnenus sent a letter to Pope Urban II, asking for succor from Latin Christendom in order to repel the Muslim invaders who were overrunning his empire. Pope Urban II did not merely comply with this request, but transformed it into a call to restore to Christendom the lands of Christianity's origin, which had been lost to Muslim rule in the seventh century. In doing so, Pope Urban inspired and unleashed an outpouring of religious fervor- and bloodshed- unique in the annals of Christian history. This course will be dedicated to the examination of this extraordinary movement, from the initial overwhelming response it aroused among Christians across Europe through the fall of Acre in 1291. Among the issues it will explore are the historical, political, and ideological background to the Crusades, in Byzantium, Europe, and the Islamic world; The Peasants' Crusade and the Children's Crusade; the Latin principalities in the Near East, their organization and societies; interactions between Muslims and Christians; the status and treatment of religious minorities; the legend of Prester John and how it inaugurated the beginning of the European exploration of Central and Eastern Asia; the Italian communes and growth of commerce; the military orders; the career of St. Louis in the Near East; the Ayyubid and Mamluk sultanates and the geopolitical consequences of the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century; and more. Students will spend the second half of the course researching and writing a capstone research paper utilizing primary sources in translation."
HIST 30456	Between the early rumblings of the Reformations and the last cannon shot of World War I, Europeans profoundly changed how they conceptualized bodies as experience and metaphors. During these four centuries, Europeans grounded the ways in which they interacted with each other and the world in bodily imaginings. On an individual level, the living, human body provided a means of accessing and understanding the material or spiritual world. On a collective scale, the physical body, its adornments, and its gestures provided markers that Europeans used to fracture society along axes of gender, sexuality, class, race, mental aptitude, and even sacrality. Drawing in part from their myriad imaginings of the human body, Europeans constructed metaphorical political bodies. The body politic assumed diverse forms spanning from divine right monarchs to revolutionary republics to modern nation states. Our course will lay bare the human body as culturally constructed, while fleshing out how Europeans' evolving visions affected political imaginings.
HIST 30554	This class introduces students to the history of Catholicism since the French Revolution, focusing primarily on Europe. It examines how Catholics confronted the challenges of modernity - from liberal democracy and nationalism; to capitalism and modern science; to new political ideologies such as fascism and communism. We will explore not only how these encounters transformed the Church, but also how Catholicism itself has shaped modern politics and culture. The first part of the course begins with the nineteenth-century  - culture wars - between Catholics and anticlerical forces, focusing in particular on popular devotions like the Lourdes pilgrimage and the perceived &quot;feminization&quot; of religion. The second part of the course shifts to the twentieth century and examines the relationship between the Catholic Church and modern political ideologies such as nationalism, fascism, communism, and democracy. The third part of the course explores modern Catholic art, literature, and film. Finally, we close by examining the more recent history of Catholicism since the transformative changes of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. Readings are drawn from a range of primary sources - including novels, speeches, Church documents, works of art, and films - as well as secondary sources by historians.
HIST 30604	This course surveys the years 1848 to 1877 and centers on the constitutional crisis of the mid-19th Century that exploded in the U.S. Civil War. We begin with the political controversies over slavery, consider the eruption of violence between abolitionists and slaveholders, the breakdown of the political system that climaxed in the election of 1860, the southern rebellion to Lincoln's election, the experience of the war itself, the process of emancipation, and the political struggles during Reconstruction over federal power and the place of African-Americans in the Republic. This course emphasizes constitutional, political, social, and cultural events, the decisions made by public officials and voters, by men and women, by whites and blacks. In order to understand this tumultuous era, we will read political and legal documents as well as poetry, fiction, and private letters. Lastly, we will consider the ways in which historians evaluate the period and the ways the public remembers it. The course will be a mix of lecture and discussion.
HIST 30606	This course offers an introduction to the history of the United States from Reconstruction through the First World War with particular emphasis on the social, cultural, and intellectual formations of the period. The United States made a dramatic transition in these years: from a predominantly agrarian and rural society to an urban, industrial society and imperial, world power. It is also said that in this period, a new, national, and distinctly modern culture emerged. We will test the merits of this claim and attempt to understand how Americans grappled with these broad transformations by examining the history of social formations, including class, race, and gender, together with the history of cultural formations - American popular culture, the adaptations of bourgeois culture, and the creation of mass culture. In reading sources such as short stories, poetry, political speeches, and novels, and analyzing photography, film, advertising, and architecture, we will explore the making of a modern America.
HIST 30616	This course offers a broad thematic overview of the history of capitalism from the early sixteenth century up to the late 1980s. As a discussion-based seminar, we will devote most of our conversations to discovering, analyzing and reflecting on the transformation of the U.S. from a newly-independent British colony, to the most influential economic power in the world. Topics and themes we will consider include: the rise of early modern transnational capitalism, European imperialism and trade, and indigenous dispossession after 1492; science and technological transformations; social and economic thought; slavery and servitude, broadly construed; and characteristics of prosperity, wealth, and economic flux.     Our readings and viewings will be a mix of scholarly and primary sources, including an abundance of canonical literary and artistic material, such as novels, visual art, and film excerpts (e.g. Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House (1879), Aaron Douglas's Building More Stately Mansions (1944), and Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence (1920)). Over the course of the semester, students will draw upon this eclectic combination of sources to synthesize the dominant historical dimensions of capitalism in and beyond the U.S. via four short essays (4 - 5 pages, double-spaced-between 1,100 and 1,400 words), and a final paper (10 - 12 pages, double-spaced) based on cumulative texts.
HIST 30632	This class considers the environment's role in shaping history. We will discover how our stories of the past change when we include microbes, pigs, and the climate, alongside of more typical subjects like presidents, wars, and ideas. We will ask what nature has meant in the past to a range of people, from the Comanche on the Great Plains, to settler-farmers in New England, to coal miners in Colorado. Throughout the course we will also ask the question: What is nature? And how have ideas about nature changed over time? A premise of this course is that nature is not something &quot;out there,&quot; but in fact is everywhere. Thus, we will explore a robust set of thematic topics that will illumine the the varied meanings of &quot;nature&quot;: the ways it is constructed, how ideas about it have changed over time, how it surrounds us, nourishes us, has been used to justify violence and racism, how it impedes on our lives.
HIST 30633	This course provides an introduction to the history of American slavery. After examining the origins and transformation of Atlantic world slavery, the courses focuses particularly upon slavery in the United States. Between the American Revolution and the Civil War, the United States grew into the largest slaveholding society in the modern world. U.S. slavery's growth was driven forward by massive global economic transformations and territorial conquest. Yet, in the face of unprecedented violence, enslaved people themselves brought about the end of slavery and transformed the meaning of freedom in the United States. This course focuses upon this history from the perspective of enslaved people themselves with particular attention to struggles for freedom. Through an examination of this history and its legacies, the course will introduce students to histories of resistance.
HIST 30643	This course explores how ideas about race and racism have been intertwined with scientific, medical, and technological developments, shaping society since the 18th century. While recognizing that race is fundamentally a social construct, the course delves into scientific efforts to quantify, measure, and categorize individuals by race from early anthropometry to contemporary developments like the Human Genome Project and artificial intelligence. By critically analyzing scientific theories that produced and built upon ideas of racial hierarchy, students will develop a deep understanding of how race, racism, and racial inequality have been embedded into scientific knowledge, and thus, societal understanding. Students will also examine the historical context of racial disparities in healthcare, including the development of racialized medical theories, and will explore the role of technology in reinforcing or challenging racial biases, from the early days of photography to modern AI and surveillance technologies. This course is tailored for students with interests in the history of science and the production of scientific knowledge, as well as those curious about the origins of scientific racism and racial inequality.
HIST 30644	This course traces the development of consumer society in the United States from the colonial era through the late twentieth century. It asks how Americans came to define the &quot;good life&quot; as one marked by material abundance and how transformations in buying and selling have shaped American culture, politics, and national identity. One of our aims will be to develop a usable historical definition of consumer society and to evaluate when such a society emerged in the United States. We will examine the role that consumption has played in defining and policing ideals of gender, race, sexuality, and class. We will also consider how Americans have used consumer practices and spaces to advance political claims and notions of citizenship. The course is organized around key turning points in American consumer capitalism: the consumer boom of the eighteenth century; the market revolution and feminization of consumption; the birth of the department store; the rise of mass consumption and commercial leisure; the development of modern advertising and sales; the spread of chain stores and shopping malls; and the globalization of American consumer culture. In addition to recent scholarship and text-based primary sources, we will analyze artifacts of consumer culture, such as advertisements, catalogs, product labels, broadsides, film, and television.
HIST 30709	This major-level course is designed to provide students with a substantive overview of Latina/o immigration and community formation in Chicago during the twentieth century, and how it became one of the largest Latino cities in the United States.  The Windy City's rise in the nineteenth century as an industrial metropolis transformed it as a magnet for capital, culture, and labor. A series of key events around the turn of the century and into the early decades of the twentieth century - the Spanish-American War of 1898, the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1920, the rise of economic production during World War I (1914-1918), and the Immigration Act of 1924 that greatly reduced Eastern and Southern European immigration - would come to shape the patterns, processes, and terms of Latina/o migration into Chicago, particularly those of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.  Mexicans and other Latin Americans joined the Great Migrations of African Americans and ethnic whites to look for better opportunities in the north, and since then, Latino Chicagoans have forged communities as they have also negotiated the broader social, cultural, and political currents of American history throughout the twentieth century.   This course will introduce students to these broader patterns as explored through recent scholarship on Latinos/as in Chicago.  Students will also read key primary sources in the field and consider the historiographical debates about retelling this aspect of Chicago's history.
HIST 30749	This course covers the varied experience of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (and other gender-fluid) Americans over the course of the twentieth century.  As much as possible, it will focus on the voices of LGBT people themselves, in the context of the changing meanings of what it was to claim those identities.  To do this we will draw on primary sources—art, music, film, literature, interviews and oral histories, memoirs and autobiographies, plays, films. The focus will be on the ways people understood who they were--and what homosexual/gay/lesbian/queer/transsexual/transgender/et al identities meant to them--and how these identities changed over the course of the twentieth century, using a wide variety of primary sources and relevant disciplinary frameworks.
HIST 30763	This course traces the history of Buddhism in the United States since the nineteenth century. After considering the history of Asian immigrants who brought Buddhism with them and American-born converts who embraced it here, we take some steps toward a cultural history of Buddhism in the US since 1945, analyzing the tradition's influence on other faiths and on politics, activism, fiction, poetry, painting, video art, film, music, architecture, martial arts, how-to literature, psychology, and medicine.
HIST 30805	This course covers the main developments in American foreign policy from World War II through the end of the Cold War.  The principal topics of investigation will be wartime diplomacy and the origins of the Cold War; the Cold War and containment in Europe and Asia; Eisenhower/Dulles diplomacy; Kennedy-Johnson and Vietnam; Nixon-Kissinger and détente; Carter and the diplomacy of Human Rights; Reagan and the revival of containment; Bush and the end of the Cold War.
HIST 30861	Scholars and activists use the concept of the &quot;carceral state&quot; to describe the official, government use of policing, surveillance, and mass imprisonment to exercise control over society. This course examines the histories, cultures, politics and economics of prison and policing in the United States, in order to determine how the U.S. carceral state has been a factor in the social construction of race, gender, and citizenship.   We will study the genealogy of the U.S. carceral state--beginning with the surveillance embedded in the earliest practices of slavery and settler colonialism, tracing its development through the 19th and early 20th centuries, and concluding with the rise of the modern prison, industrial complex. we will then focus on contemporary U.S. prison, policing and surveillance, using case studies including the &quot;war on drugs,&quot;  immigrant detention, sex-crime regulation, and police violence. Finally , we will consider alternatives to prisons and policing, as we learn about academic research and activist movements working to end state and police violence, abolish prisons, and create opportunities for restorative justice.   Over the course of the semester, students will learn about the historical development and ongoing maintenance of the carceral state, sing and intersecitonal framework that highlights the ways in which prisons and policing have both shaped and been shaped by race gender citizenship and economics. Along the way studies will ask and address such questions: how does the U.S. carceral state function as a tool for social control? what histories, policies and ideologies underlie the carceral state? how have individual and organizations worked to transform or abolish the carceral state? How have art and cultural production been used to normalize and /or critique the carceral state? And can we imagine a world without prison or police?
HIST 30877	This course will survey historical scholarship on the development of American cities and suburbs from World War II to the present.  Making use of primary and secondary sources, and print and visual media, we will seek to understand what defines American cities and suburbs, how the idea and ideals of cities and suburbs have changed over time, and what forces have shaped the places in which we live today.  We will explore how a metropolitan approach to modern American history sheds light on major events, movements, and transformations of the twentieth century along thematic lines of race, class, and education; politics and protest; modernity and religion; gender and sexuality; ethnicity, immigration, globalization, and citizenship; urban crisis, renewal, and gentrification; and urban sprawl and environmentalism. Course objectives include learning to analyze and interpret primary sources, including written texts, film, photographs, and the built environment; to read secondary sources critically and effectively; to identify significant people, places, and events in twentieth-century American urban, social, and political history; to recognize major changes and continuities in postwar urban history; and to place contemporary issues and debates in historical and cultural context.
HIST 30912	This course is designed to introduce students to the modern history of “Greater Mexico” and its people. The emphasis on “greater” in the title is an attempt to complicate narrow ideas of the “nation” that generally exclude Mexicans residing in the United States or erroneously describe them exclusively as “immigrants.” The first two parts of the class pay particular attention to political and artistic movements that developed during the Porfiriato (1876—1910), the Revolution (1910—c.1940), and the post-revolutionary period (c.1938—1970s). The third part of the class continues on its emphasis on art, but also examines the role of youth and its response to the neoliberal period (1980s-present).   Students will examine what it meant to be a “militant” in the political world of artistic production and social movements in Revolutionary and “Greater Mexico” and the different ways in which the Mexican and American governments responded to this militancy. We will learn how and why a broad range of representative leaders of Greater Mexico’s most important political and cultural revolutions used paintings, murals, graphic art, photography, cartoons, music, graffiti, and especially film to (A) lead a social, cultural, and political restructuring of their respective communities; (B) export their unique notions of “Revolution” to the nation and to the world; and (C) question the contradictions that some artists (at times) faced within their own revolutionary movements in both the national and global contexts, from the revolutionary to the neoliberal period.  The success of the course relies on a combination of note-taking during the lectures, a willingness to analyze art (individually and collaboratively in group work), and a constant engagement during the class and group discussions.
HIST 30924	In 2007, after decades of organizing on the part of indigenous activists, the United Nations issued a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Declaration was the result of years of work by people from particular communities--each with its own history, culture, language, and home--who decided to call themselves, and work together as, Indigenous people. This creative step allowed indigenous peoples to work collectively for justice on a global scale, rather than individually and in confrontation with single states. This class explores the concept, and reality, of Indigeneity in both historical and contemporary perspective: we will consider the many shared struggles and opportunities of indigenous peoples around the globe today and the ways that similar (or distinct) histories have led to similar (or distinct) present realities.
HIST 30926	This course examines the origins and development of contemporary opinions and policies concerning migrations and migrants. It does so by looking backward to the age when transoceanic mobility became more frequent and increasingly more accessible before moving forward to our own times. It is the central claim of this course that it is impossible to understand what drives policy today without first surveying the changing ideas of migration and the movement of people over time. It will therefore take students through the history of migration in the modern world, as well as studying the migrant journey, connections to home, the process and difficulties of assimilation and community creation, and the problems or opportunities that could arise for migrants from characteristics like race, religion, ethnicity, or language. Also considered will be the complex relationship between colonization and migration. In the process, Migrants and Mobility will also examine how different societies place value judgments upon migrants and analyze how and why migration/migrants have been categorized as “good” or “bad” over time. Students will also encounter and consider the effects of growing urbanization and industrialization, changing demography and global trade patterns, and, more recently, the impact of climate change. Migrants and Mobility will be primarily seminar based, placing a premium on participation and analytical discussion.
HIST 30951	This interdisciplinary research lab enlists students in the efforts of the Just Wage Initiative (JWI), a collaborative research and advocacy project of the Higgins Labor Program at the Center for Social Concerns. Students will help develop, refine, and update the Just Wage Framework, a multistakeholder online tool designed to advance a more inclusive and equitable economy. Students will also undertake research projects connecting their own intellectual interests and disciplinary expertise to the JWI's foundational question: What makes any given wage just or unjust? In addition, students will collaborate with the instructor and local, national, and international practitioners to envision and execute collaborative research and advocacy campaigns to promote a just wage economy. Extended weekly class sessions will feature visits by scholars and activists, as well as facilitate interactive group discussions and collaborative experiments.
HIST 30952	In 1964, when Martha Reeves sang, &quot;Calling out around the world/Are you ready for a brand new beat?/Summer's here and the time is right/For dancing in the street,&quot; was she beckoning listeners to join a party or the civil rights struggle? Or both? From spirituals sung by enslaved workers to protest anthems shouted at union rallies, music has provided the soundtrack to social justice causes throughout American History. Whether performed by rank-and-file reformers or famous recording artists -- from Frank Sinatra to Nina Simone to Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, and beyond -- popular music has accompanied and sometimes fueled transformations in American politics, culture, and social life. In this course students will explore American popular music in its many forms -- blues, country, jazz, folk, rock, punk, disco, hip hop, tejano, and more -- to understand its power and limits as both a force for social change and a window into major themes of the American experience.
HIST 30986	We live in a fully engineered world.  What we eat, what we wear, where and how we live, the ways we entertain ourselves, the air we breath and the very ground we walk on are all the product of engineering.  The profession of engineering emerged from modest beginnings to global prominence: in the twentieth century engineers came to design, implement, and manage nearly all elements of the modern world from their positions within corporations and government bureaucracies. Engineering is embedded in histories of capitalism, development, the environment, and human welfare. We examine the work of engineers in the United States and Europe as well as in places such as China, India, Mexico, Chile, and elsewhere. Students will develop a research project on a topic in this history, using archival and/or digitized sources.  No background in history or engineering is required. 
HIST 33000	This course is a requirement for - and open only to - History majors and minors. Designed as the gateway into the undergraduate history programs, History Workshop is a seminar that introduces students to how historians study the past by emphasizing active participation in the research and writing of history (not just reading what other historians have already written). Students gain insight into the nature of historical inquiry through discussion of how historians work, analysis of primary source documents from at least two different time periods and places, and, most importantly, their own efforts to write history via original interpretive historical essays.
HIST 33757	This course offers an overview of the interaction between Catholics and public life in America during the half century following the Second Vatican Council and the election of a Catholic as President in 1960. The course should permit students to gain a greater familiarity with the engagement and response of various Catholic individuals and groups on some major political and social-cultural issues. It will explore the extent of Catholic influence in American politics and society during the period and will explore the role of religion in shaping (or not shaping) the outlooks of a number of significant Catholic political figures beginning with JFK, RFK, and Eugene McCarthy, moving to Mario Cuomo and Daniel Patrick Moynihan down to contemporary figures. The course offers each student the opportunity to research and write a major paper on a topic of his or her choosing in this area.
HIST 35049	This semester our seminar focuses on the history of money in economies and societies across time and space. We will explore key developments in the evolution of money and finance in world history, starting with finance as it emerged with the first civilizations of the Near East in the third millennium BCE to the recent debates about cryptocurrencies -- in short, from Babylon to blockchain. Through a wide variety of readings, short lectures, and well prepared discussions, we will explore all aspects of money and finance as tools and technologies to manage the economics of time and risk in different cultural settings. Topics include the role of money and finance as contributors to urban growth and social specialization across civilizations, the evolution of concepts such as investment, trust, and interest, and more generally how money and finance allowed people past (and present) to think about the future.
HIST 35440	This course explores the history of the six north-eastern counties of Ireland which became &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; in 1920/1. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and had a built-in Protestant unionist majority, while the Catholic minority, alienated from the state from the outset, looked across the new border and to Dublin, capital of the Irish Free State, as the site of their allegiance. Northern Ireland was thus, from the beginning, dysfunctional, scarred by sectarian violence and systematic discrimination in housing and employment. After examining the origins of the state and the early decades of it existence, the class will turn to its main concern, &quot;the troubles,&quot; which broke out in the late 1960s. The major episodes under scrutiny include the civil rights movement, Bloody Sunday, the hunger strikes, and the Good Friday Peace Agreement.
HIST 35453	The French Revolution created a turning point in history by paving the way for modern politics and society. Napoleon's empire, on the other hand, toppled some of the oldest European monarchies and shook up the international status quo. During two and a half turbulent decades, the French destroyed feudalism, created a constitutional monarchy, founded a republic, and built an empire that stretched across the continent. Our course will focus on how the French reinvented the social, cultural, and political dimensions of their world from the 1780s to 1815. We will ask major questions such as: What were the origins of the French Revolution? How did the revolutionaries recreate political culture and social structures? Why did the Revolution radicalize at first but eventually slide into an empire? Was Napoleon the &quot;son of the Revolution&quot; or did he betray its major goals? Of special note, our course includes a 4-week &quot;Reacting to the Past&quot; game that allows you to engage in history from a completely new perspective. During this historical role-playing unit, you will become a specific member of the National Assembly or the Parisian crowd. To win, you must pass a constitution favorable to your position while wrestling &quot;with the threat of foreign invasion, political and religious struggles, and questions of liberty and citizenship.&quot; Although we may change the course of history within the unit, you will root your arguments in resources available to your historical persona: primary documents, political treatises, inspiring speeches, secret collaborations, and &quot;current&quot; events.
HIST 35557	This course explores the historical relationship between the Catholic Church and the rise and fall of European overseas empires since the sixteenth century. We will consider how Catholic missionaries both reinforced and resisted colonial power structures; how the Church made sense of racial, religious, and cultural differences in its efforts to evangelize colonial subjects; how African, Asian, and Latin American Catholics developed their own distinctive spiritual practices; and how Catholics in both Europe and its former colonies grappled with the challenge of decolonization and how to undo the legacies of colonialism within the Church itself. Readings will be drawn from a range of sources, including missionary diaries and manuals, memoirs, artwork, papal encyclicals, films, novels, works of theology, and historical scholarship.
HIST 35624	This seminar examines the rise of the modern fashion and garment industries in Europe and North America during the 20th century. We will trace the movement away from custom-made clothing to ready-to-wear and the invention of the department store. We will read early reformers who criticized women's dress as deadly and later home economists who taught how to dress according to standards of efficiency and beauty. Along the way, we will notice the significance of changing styles, and how they affected the lives of modern men and women of different classes and races through the decades. We will pay particular attention to the dress revolutions of the 1920s and 1960s. Students will be introduced to several on-line databases including HEARTH, the Vogue archives, and the Ebony archives.
HIST 35625	In this course, we will explore the history of boxing in the United States and learn a great deal about the craft of boxing—what the writers Pierce Egan and A.J. Liebling have called “the sweet science”—as well as the craft of writing and thinking.  The course will chart the story of boxing in America from the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries.  It will start in England, move to places like nineteenth-century New York, where boxing was transformed from a gambling pursuit among the working class into a mass spectator sport, examine the time when boxing became ascendant in America, and end in the late twentieth century when boxing was entangled with transformations to American cities and with changing race politics.  The story of boxing is the story of America.  The class will look at the rise of cities, global trade, labor, mass migration, changing understandings of gender, race, and class, and the highs and lows of American culture. In other words, this is not a sports history class. We will also learn about the finer points of boxing, how fighting changed over time, and how technique developed.   By doing all this, students will come to appreciate the inner workings of a dynamic and changing craft, one tied to America’s past. We will read and discuss all sorts of fascinating books and essays on the subject, each giving us a different perspective on both the “sweet science” and the people who tried to master it.  We will watch film, read literature, and work with some documents from different time periods.  Through lectures, we will also encounter some of the more enlightening and enlivening stories of boxing’s past.
HIST 35671	This course asks how we should narrate and understand the great ordeal of Civil War and emancipation. Reading both primary and secondary sources, it considers the Civil War era and life of Abraham Lincoln in light of the rise of abolition and antislavery politics; attitudes toward race, slavery, and labor; the political and social meanings of war and emancipation; the political and social challenge of reconstructing the nation amidst the tangled legacies of racial slavery and a destructive war.
HIST 35936	In this course we will examine the historical construction of gendered roles in the Spanish colonial world. This will entail thinking about gender in the societies which &quot;encountered&quot; each other in the New World, and also thinking about how that encounter produced new forms of gendered relations. Among the questions we will consider: how was the conquest gendered? How did colonial society produce masculinity as well as femininity? What gendered forms of power were available to women? How did ethnicity and caste, as well as gender, determine people's sense of themselves and their &quot;others&quot;? The course will look at a mixture of primary and secondary materials, including letters and chronicles written by men and women, testimony before the Spanish Inquisition, poetry, and novels. While there are no prerequisites for this seminar, some familiarity with colonial Latin American history will be helpful.
HIST 40210	Herodotus has been called both the &quot;Father of History&quot; and the &quot;Father of Lies.&quot; Thucydides is revered by some as the first &quot;scientific&quot; historian; others deny him the title of historian altogether. The most famous tales in Roman history come from the early books of Livy, and yet it is unlikely that he had any way of obtaining reliable information for that period. The historians of the classical Greek and Roman world stand among the greatest writers of the Western tradition. But to what extent were they performing the task that we call &quot;history&quot;?  In this course we will survey the works of the major historians of ancient Greece and Rome, including Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus and others. We will examine the origins of Greek historiography, the methods espoused and practiced by Greek and Roman historians, the effect political and social changes had on ancient historiography, and the relationship of ancient historical writing to that of the modern scholars. The class will be primarily discussion-based. All readings in the ancient authors will be in English.
HIST 40305	"This course provides an in-depth introduction to the archaeology of the ancient Greek world, focusing on the Classical, Hellenistic and Early Roman Imperial periods (ca. 480 BC to <a href=""/search/?p=AD%20138"" data-action=""result-detail"" data-group=""code:AD 138""  class=""notoffered"">AD 138</a>). The survey of material culture traces the development of architecture, painting, sculpture, coinage, and other archaeological material in relation to cultural, political, social and philosophical issues. The course explores the urban, sacred, rural, funerary and provincial landscapes of Greece and introduces students to the analysis and interpretation of archaeological sites, monuments, artifacts, and art. Topics include the Athenian Acropolis in the age of Pericles, the masterpieces of Praxiteles and Lysippos, the creation of the Roman province of Greece under Augustus, and Hadrian’s Roman Agora in Athens, as well as the methods, results, and theory of archaeological research in the areas of field excavation and intensive surface survey. Through the material record, the course attempts to reconstruct what life might have been like in ancient Greece."
HIST 41000	History Lab Research allows undergraduate students to assist a faculty member's research project(s) for credit.
HIST 43211	In this seminar, we will trace the various ways in which early modern Europeans looked to antiquity for inspiration in their own present, and try to find new ways to examine that legacy. The writings, institutions, and physical remains of ancient Greece and Rome were fundamental to the formation of early modern European culture.  &quot;Renaissance&quot; may be a modern term, but sixteenth-century Italians referred constantly to a &quot;rebirth&quot; of literary and artistic achievement.  They had no intention of giving up medieval improvements to life like paper and compasses and Hindu-Arabic numerals: rather, they were convinced that better familiarity with the ancients could inspire new solutions to present problems, from the structure of the universe, to the principles of good government, to the criteria by which to judge a valid work of art, architecture, or literature.  Their idea of &quot;antiquity&quot; went beyond Greece and Rome to include the ancient Hebrews, Egyptians, Etruscans, Goths, Batavians, Britons, Phoenicians, Ethiopians, Indians, and Chinese.  Like human nature, &quot;antiquity&quot; in the early modern period was a two-edged sword.  The Roman Empire provided a brutal model of aggression and exploitation (and environmental destruction); as the ancient Roman author Tacitus famously noted: &quot;They create a desert and call it peace.&quot;  Rome was also, however, a model of inclusion that eventually spanned three continents. Antiquity also provided marvelous opportunities for early modern forgers and impostors, some of whom exerted remarkable influence before their exposure as frauds.
HIST 46000	Directed Readings in History facilitates a student's reading and analysis of a specialized set of texts under the guidance of an individual faculty member.
HIST 48000	Directed Research in History facilitates a student's particularized research project on a historical topic under the guidance of an individual faculty member.
HIST 53001	This course is open only to students in the Department of History honors program. It has two agendas: (1) to introduce students to theoretical and practical foundations of historical method; and (2) to help get you started on your honors research. During the first half of the semester, we will discuss and practice key aspects of historical method, providing a structure for you to start your own research. You will work on multiple drafts of a research proposal, develop a bibliography, and begin your research in primary sources. By the end of the semester, you should be close to completing your research and beginning to write the first draft of your honors essay. This course will try to assist you in planning and budgeting your time toward the goal of minimizing the stress and maximizing the intellectual rewards of participating in the honors program.
HIST 58004	History Honors Program seniors only.  In the fall and spring of the senior year, the history honors student will work on a thesis (40 to 80 pages) under the supervision of a specific faculty member.
HIST 63350	In this seminar, we will trace the various ways in which early modern Europeans looked to antiquity for inspiration in their own present, and try to find new ways to examine that legacy.   The writings, institutions, and physical remains of ancient Greece and Rome were fundamental to the formation of early modern European culture. &quot;Renaissance&quot; may be a modern term, but sixteenth-century Italians referred constantly to a &quot;rebirth&quot; of literary and artistic achievement.

Antiquity also provided marvelous opportunities for early modern forgers and impostors, some of whom exerted remarkable influence before their exposure as frauds.
HIST 83002	This seminar serves as an introduction to balancing the range of professional commitments pursuant to a career as an academic historian. Topics will vary from semester to semester, but some of those covered include research, teaching, administrative responsibilities, classroom and student problems, conduct, publication, seeking employment, career alternatives, and time management. All second-year graduate students in history are required to pass this course in the fall semester as they become teaching assistants. Attendance, preparation, and participation are required.
HIST 83025	What would it mean to approach intellectual history not as the study of ideas per se but as the study of underlying changes that made the emergence of new concepts possible? Does intellectual history demand a different methodological framework than, say, social history or political history? Can we write a history of rationality itself? These are some of the questions posed by &quot;historical epistemology,&quot; a tradition of joint historical and philosophical analysis that began in France and spread to Anglo-American circles in the late twentieth century. We will explore this perspective through the work of some of its key practitioners and intellectual ancestors, including Gaston Bachelard, Georges Canguilhem, Ian Hacking, and Lorraine Daston, among others. A major part of the course will be dedicated to the early- to mid-career work of Michel Foucault, who became a core vehicle for bringing this approach to Anglo-American historians. 
HIST 83110	The course examines key writings in the history of Islamic thought. Using a variety of theoretical approaches ranging from writings by Ibn Khaldun, Marshall Hodgson to Michel Foucault, this advanced course examines the conditions under which multiplicities of Islamic knowledge, discourses and domains of power had been formulated over time. The course will utilize Hodgson's The Venture of Islam and Ibn Khaldun's, Muqaddima as the two main texts. Several other readings authored by scholars ranging from Iqbal, Fazlur Rahman, Jabri, Laroui in addition to theorists like Collingwood, Koselleck and Asad will be studied. The goal of the course is to engage in a textured and fine grain reading of how Muslim domains of knowledge and ideas were formulated over time.
HIST 83204	&quot;Any historical period called ‘late' is headed for interpretive trouble, and one called ‘late medieval' is probably doomed.&quot; So John Van Engen began his reflections on the late medieval Church. The same historiographical problem appears in the title of an important article by Howard Kaminsky, &quot;From Lateness to Waning to Crisis.&quot; This class faces a great challenge: how to make sense of a period for which the master narrative of &quot;lateness&quot; is compounded by the lack of any compelling counter-narrative. The enduring influence of Johan Huizinga's Autumn of the Middle Ages (available in a new English translation since 1996) is clear to anyone with a passing knowledge of the field.  This course cannot supply a counter-narrative, but it will provide students with an overview of the major themes in late medieval history, and thus with the tools to reevaluate the master narrative of lateness and crisis for themselves. Practically, it can also serve as good preparation for a general field exam in late medieval history.  The class requires a heavy reading load, and students should come prepared to discuss the readings. Beyond weekly reports, students will have two major assignments and several shorter papers. Assigned readings are in English, both books and articles. Of course the reality is that the scholarship is deep in all of the major European languages, and the bibliography on many topics (e.g. the Black Death, the late medieval Church) almost impossibly large and ongoing.
HIST 83501	This seminar aims to introduce students to various discourses that have influenced modern theology. We will cover topics such as how to interpret texts, assess them, and understand the context and assumptions within them. The seminar title may seem confusing since it connects an Augustinian friar and a Cologne philosopher. However, they both recognize the importance of the emotional, intuitive, and a-logical aspects of humanity and reflect on inner life. We will discuss devotio moderna and its influences, Erasmus, the Augustinian reform movement under Staupitz, and Luther himself. The second area we will explore is the theology developed after the Reformation. We will discuss approaches to Scripture and Revelation, changes in the understanding of faith, and how theologians analyze and prepare for faith. The third area of inquiry will focus on the question of certitude in matters of faith. We will examine how theologians negotiate ambiguity and manage certitude. We will also discuss the theological notes and how they assign levels of authority to church teachings. Fourth, we will explore the developments that led to the creation of the Enlightenment and what it was. We will cover Enlightenment thought and how it influenced the recovery of intuition in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, and Scheler. Lastly, we will examine how to deal with accounts of miracles or the impossible such as bilocations or levitations. While I have not yet determined the entire syllabus, I am considering using selections from various books, eg.:  Van Engen, Sisters and Brothers of the Common Life; Luther, Rejection of monastic vows; Erasmus, Enchiridion; A. Arnaud, The Necessity of Faith in Jesus Christ; Tutino, Credulitas; C. Eire, They Flew; H. Plessner, Limits of Community; Henry Holden, Analysis of Faith; M. Scheler, Of the Eternal in Man; M. Scheler, Resentment; The idols of self-knowledge; Dilthey, Introduction to the Human Sciences; Schleiermacher, Reden; R. Otto, The Holy; Chadwick, From Bossuet to Newman; M. Hunter, The Decline of Magic; Kripal, Superhumanities
HIST 83604	The colloquium is an intensive survey of recent historical writing on the United States from the late nineteenth century forward. Topics will include Progressive reform, gender and the early 20th century State, the culture of consumption, the new environmental history, the meaning of bohemia,  the character of New Deal liberalism, the origins of the cold war and the shifting nature of American race relations.
HIST 86000	Directed Readings in History facilitates a student's reading and analysis of a specialized set of texts under the guidance of an individual faculty member.
HIST 93330	Historiography is one of the primary genres of Byzantine literature. No doubt, authors like Michael Psellos, Anna Komnene, or Niketas Choniates count among the most accomplished historians of the medieval Mediterranean world, being read and appreciated far beyond the field of Byzantine studies. The late antique genres of secular political and ecclesiastical history writing persisted, merged, and developed in various forms throughout the Byzantine millennium and found continuators even after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. We thus have an almost unbroken sequence of historical works providing the essential information for all significant developments in the empire’s political affairs. However, historical narratives were not confined to these texts. They can be found in many other genres of Byzantine literature, such as encomiastic speeches and poems, letters, saints’ lives, foundation charters of monasteries, and legal documents. All these text types significantly deepen our understanding of Byzantine historical thought.  This course explores how the Byzantines thought about and made sense of their past in different periods and historical circumstances. It focuses on authors and their social and intellectual environment on the one hand and problems of source criticism on the other. Thus, we will discuss the socioeconomic circumstances in which historical narratives were produced and the living conditions and experiences that shaped approaches to and perceptions of historical events and actors. Analyzing literary conventions, rhetorical devices, and historical concepts will lead us to possible ways of deciphering modes of expression and uncovering underlying realities. This course invites not only advanced students of Byzantium but also those who would like to learn more about Byzantium and the Eastern Mediterranean through some of its most appreciated primary sources in modern translations.
HIST 93406	This course will introduce students to the study of nationalism in a broad theoretical context.  Then we will turn to specific case studies (consisting of classics and more recent approaches to nationalism, national history, and national identity. Topics will inlcude  civic and state-oriented views of nationalism, as well as ethnic-group / movement centered ideas and books.  Toward the end of the course, we will critically examine ideas such as “national indifference” and “transnationalism” (current fashionable words in historians’ discourse) to see where nationalism studies has gone and where it might be going.  Though the professor is a historian of modern Europe and many of the case studies will come from this context, the course will be designed so that students of other regions can benefit from the approaches, problems (both practical and theoretical) as well.
HIST 93609	This graduate seminar explores the history of women, gender relations, and ideas of sex difference in the United States, reaching from the colonial era to the late twentieth century. Issues of work, rights, citizenship, race, marriage, and sexuality take center stage as we explore the social, political, and cultural forces that shaped women's lives and the aspirations of those who sought to transform gender ideals and relations in the United States. The course is designed to introduce students to important questions, methodological approaches, and historiographical debates in the field through classic as well as cutting-edge scholarship. Our primary concern will be the United States, but we will take brief comparative glances to other nations and regions of the world.
HIST 93909	This seminar introduces graduate students to the modern history of Latin America, from independence to the present. We will question the idea of “Latin America”—as a teaching category of analysis in relation to the “West” and the “Global South”—and study a selected number of themes that have shaped our understanding of the region, from liberalism and rising notions of state formation to competing interpretations of anti-imperialism, mestizaje, revolution, populism, conservatism, Catholicism, feminism, the Cold War, and neoliberalism. While an effort will be made in covering various countries in the region, the attention will be placed instead on some of the most recent scholarship on the modern history of Latin America. We will read and discuss the methodological differences in this expanding literature, question the limitations that continue to center a US-based position in the study of the region, and place our discussions in conversation with key primary documents, including manifestoes, speeches, short films, and literary texts that represent competing ideological perspectives as well as various points of view on class, gender, ethnicity, and race. Upon completion of the course, students will be well prepared to teach a Latin American history survey, map out the various methodological approaches that scholars of the region have developed over the years, explore a focused theme for their doctoral dissertation projects, and identify the foundational texts for their Ph.D exams, not only in history, but also in Romance Languages, Literature, and other disciplines.
HIST 97000	A special reading course in which the student may enroll only in the semester in which he or she takes the Ph.D. candidacy examination. It permits the student to devote full time to preparation for the examination and, after its completion, to write a dissertation proposal. Regular graduate course work may also be pursued during the candidacy semester. (Annual)
HIST 98200	This course is a required course for graduate students who have completed eight years of study.
HIST 98699	Individual conferences and consultation between the doctoral student writing the dissertation and the dissertation director. Required of students pursuing dissertation research in residence.
HIST 98700	Continuing registration for the doctorate beyond 72 credits; required of students not in residence.
HPS 78599	Research and writing on an approved subject under the direction of a faculty member.
HPS 78600	Required of nonresident graduate students who are completing their theses in absentia and who wish to retain their degree status.
HPS 80146	A distinctive feature of premodern philosophy and science is the organization of nature, reasoning, and methods into elements. Philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians in the premodern world conceived of elements of reasoning as they developed axiomatic methods of demonstration and argumentation. Perhaps the most famous example of this kind of reasoning is Euclid’s Elements, but other ancient and medieval philosophers composed works in elemental modes and formulated axiomatic methods (sometimes known as demonstrating in more geometrico or a geometrical way) to study metaphysics and nature. Proclus’s Elements of Theology are a foundational and paradigmatic text in this tradition (and to a lesser extent so too is his shorter Elements of Physics). This course is centered on a close examination of Proclus’s Elements of Theology but will also study selections in this premodern tradition, including Porphyry’s Sententiae, and Cusanus’s De non aliud, as well as Boethius’s De Hebdomadibus and the Liber de causis, along with their respective commentaries by Thomas Aquinas.
HPS 80643	This course explores how ideas about race and racism have been intertwined with scientific, medical, and technological developments, shaping society since the 18th century. While recognizing that race is fundamentally a social construct, the course delves into scientific efforts to quantify, measure, and categorize individuals by race from early anthropometry to contemporary developments like the Human Genome Project and artificial intelligence. By critically analyzing scientific theories that produced and built upon ideas of racial hierarchy, students will develop a deep understanding of how race, racism, and racial inequality have been embedded into scientific knowledge, and thus, societal understanding. Students will also examine the historical context of racial disparities in healthcare, including the development of racialized medical theories, and will explore the role of technology in reinforcing or challenging racial biases, from the early days of photography to modern AI and surveillance technologies. This course is tailored for students with interests in the history of science and the production of scientific knowledge, as well as those curious about the origins of scientific racism and racial inequality.
HPS 83100	Discussion of a prominent recent work in the field of HPS, and research presentations by visiting scholars. Required course for HPS students in the first and second years of the program. (Every semester)
HPS 83608	What would it mean to approach intellectual history not as the study of ideas per se but as the study of underlying changes that made the emergence of new concepts possible? Does intellectual history demand a different methodological framework than, say, social history or political history? Can we write a history of rationality itself? These are some of the questions posed by &quot;historical epistemology,&quot; a tradition of joint historical and philosophical analysis that began in France and spread to Anglo-American circles in the late twentieth century. We will explore this perspective through the work of some of its key practitioners and intellectual ancestors, including Gaston Bachelard, Georges Canguilhem, Ian Hacking, and Lorraine Daston, among others. A major part of the course will be dedicated to the early- to mid-career work of Michel Foucault, who became a core vehicle for bringing this approach to Anglo-American historians. 
HPS 90798	Catastrophic global climate change presents intractable challenges to global politics, inherited notions of human progress and possibility, privileged Enlightenment understandings of freedom and liberation, and the very idea of literary narrative as it has emerged in imperial fossil fuel culture. This reading seminar will explore the predicament of the postcolonial anthropocene through scientific, historical, theoretical, and literary approaches, with special attention to the relationship between literacy and extractive capitalism. Readings may include work by David Abram, Aime Cesaire, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Silvia Frederici, Amitav Ghosh, Hans Jonas, Achille Mbembe, Carolyn Merchant, Peter Sloterdijk, and Sylvia Wynter.
HPS 93238	An in-depth investigation into three competing medieval theories of intellect, from Avicenna (Ibn Sina), Averroes (Ibn Rushd), and Thomas Aquinas. These are three of the most important medieval noetic systems, which adapt Aristotelian and Neo-Platonic views within the Islamic and Christian traditions and which shape influential debates into later medieval and Renaissance philosophy. Readings include Avicenna's Psychology of The Cure; Averroes' Long Commentary on De Anima; Aquinas's De Unitate Intellectus; and important secondary scholarship.
HPS 93705	How does philosophy work? While there is no single philosophical method, philosophers are frequently concerned with metaphysical possibilities—possibilities in the broad sense, unconstrained by the laws of physics. As such, rather than employing real-world experiments, philosophy employs thought experiments: experiments carried out in the imagination, scrutinizing questions that may lie beyond the scope of science, questions not about our world but about hypothetical worlds, worlds that may contain nothing other than two perfectly symmetrical, solid iron spheres, each the mirror image of the other, or a murky swamp that, when struck by lightning, gives rise to a fully functioning person replete with apparent memories of their past. Such thought experiments are designed to provoke startling insights into what is possible. And, in the best of cases, these insights are said to reveal something important about what is actual. In this class, we’ll examine whether philosophical thought experiments can bridge the gap between metaphysical possibility and this-worldly reality and consider alternative philosophical methodologies, such as empirical philosophy.
HPS 93806	This research course will explore the structure of scientific theories, with a special emphasis on the non-formal, non-literal and practical content of theories, as well as the phenomena of modeling and idealization. The primary text for the course is Duhem's The Aim and Structure of Physical Theories. We will spend the first 5 weeks of the course on a careful reading of Duhem, before turning to Mark Wilson's Duhemian thoughts in his Physics Avoidance: Essays in Conceptual Strategy. After that, we will survey the syntactic and semantic views of theories, and consider pragmatic responses by Nancy Cartwright, Hasok Chang, and other practice-based philosophers of science. Finally, we will consider the implications of our discussion for the realism/antirealism debate in the philosophy of science, as well as neo-Aristotelian attempts to articulate the practical thought inherent in science. The course will feature guest lectures by various research visitors. 
HPS 93812	This course examines the work of key figures from the history of natural philosophy and science.  Placing the philosophical work of Leibniz, Newton, Hume, Kant, Alexander Humboldt, Whewell, J. S. Mill, Helmholtz, Ernst Mach, Wilhelm Wundt, William James, Einstein, Henri Poincare, Bergson, and others, within a wider philosophical, historical, and cultural context, we will explore how and why they identified their central problems and the methods they used to approach those.   We will focus on understanding how the central problems and theories that these figures worked on, ranging from questions of space, time, motion and substance/matter to theories of human sensibility and perception, to wider epistemological and metaphysical investigations, engaged the scholarly communities surrounding them, and helped them promote broader programmatic goals for reshaping and reforming philosophy/science.  As they engaged contemporary philosophers/scientists over fundamental philosophical questions, they pressed new ideals of knowledge and programs to reform natural philosophy and reorganize the broader scholarly community - and society itself (e.g., Kant).  We will explore how these natural philosophers framed new epistemologies and simultaneously promoted new ideals of the philosopher, scholar, and/or educated citizen, who would be capable of creating valid knowledge.  In sum, we will explore how preeminent natural philosophers, at once, made original contributions to epistemology, understanding of space and time, and metaphysics, as they framed new visions of the knowing subject within a changing society.  
HPS 93821	Science and social values?  The established wisdom has it that science offers us the truth about the empirical world - what is rather than what ought to be - and that social values have little to do with it. How else explain the fact that science can be used for both good and ill and that the results of science are (or at least should be) accepted as authoritative by people of widely different ethical and political persuasions?  According to this view, in short, science is, or at least ought to be, &quot;value-free&quot; or &quot;value-neutral.&quot;    In this course we shall explore how recent research in history and sociology as well as philosophy of science has raised serious questions regarding this established wisdom and how such notions as scientific objectivity and autonomy and the role of science in a democratic society has had to be revised accordingly.   Since this is a seminar course, students will lead class discussions, present the results of their individual research projects to the group, and have the opportunity to further develop these projects using the feedback from the group.  The aim, of course, will be for students to develop fully informed and defensible responses to the controversial terrain we shall be exploring.
HPS 96697	Readings and discussion of chosen texts under the personal supervision of a member of the faculty.

IBMS 98698	Research and dissertation for resident doctoral students.
IDS 20500	An introduction to the field of international development, with particular focus on the various disciplines that have contributed to and shaped the development discourse. Readings, lectures, and discussions will draw from various disciplines, including economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, environmental and technological sciences, public health, law, and gender studies, among others. We will examine debates on the meaning and measurement of development; alternative approaches to, and methods in, the study of development; and attempts to address some of the main development challenges facing the world today. There will be a central focus on understanding &quot;what works&quot; in development. Working together in teams, students will conceptualize and design an international development project using &quot;real world&quot; constraints.
IDS 30422	India, Pakistan and Bangladesh account for more than a fifth of humanity: nearly two billion people in one of the most densely populated parts of the planet. South Asians speak more than a hundred languages, and represent most of the Hindus, Muslims, Sikh, Jains, and Zoroastrians in the world. The region's major economy, India, is by itself among the ten largest economies and one of the fastest growing. Yet, there is much about South Asia that can be perplexing. Caste based violence remains widespread in a society that is fast modernizing; billionaires mushroom alongside widespread malnourishment; space missions are launched to Mars amidst vast numbers of illiterate and uneducated citizens; Bollywood thrives while freedom of expression is often under threat; religious fundamentalism exists alongside extraordinary religious pluralism; gay rights expand alongside the murders of atheist bloggers; a democratic government lives in fear of military overthrow; a society that has that has chosen women as heads of state also sees increasing reports of sexual crimes. This course will unravel these knots and explain the processes that gave rise to them. Beginning in the middle of the twentieth century, this course will progress chronologically and bring us to the present day via themes on politics, economy, society, and popular culture. It offers an understanding of contemporary India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh and their place on the global stage.
IDS 30424	This class examines the history of engineering in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and its relationship with capitalism and development on a global scale, with the use of digital tools. Engineers came to design, implement, and manage nearly all elements of the modern world from their positions within corporations and state bureaucracies; they quickly became the primary agents in development in the 20th century. We will examine the history of engineering, introduce students to basic tools in data science, digital humanities, and data visualization, and students will develop data-intensive research projects using the skills they have learned. The class is designed for students from both Arts &amp; Letters and STEM disciplines as a window onto historical methods and an introduction to using qualitative data for analysis and data visualization. There are no prerequisites. This course emerges from a three-year NSF-funded research grant to the instructors, which includes a commitment to develop new undergraduate courses on the subject and the development of open access course materials. Student projects from this course are eligible for inclusion in our global dataset and for hosting on the project website.
IDS 30548	Global environmental politics is a field of political science that examines how political processes shape environmental outcomes and vice versa. On the one hand, it is concerned with issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation, and natural resource use. On the other hand, it studies things like political institutions, social movements, party systems, and state-business relations. All the while, it places these ideas in a cross-national, global perspective. Throughout this course, students will grapple with both foundational and emerging questions in the study of global environmental politics. Why do some governments have stronger environmental policies than others? When do interest groups support or oppose different forms of environmental regulation? What role do social movements play in supporting diverse coalitions of environmental interests? How do voters form and express preferences for or against environmental action?
IDS 30552	Social Entrepreneurship has sparked dialogue and debate for two decades. Its very definition is much debated, as well as its capacity to create sustainable, scalable, systems-changing impact. This course explores the theoretical concepts, practices and strategies associated with the dynamic discipline of social enterprise and innovation. For our purposes, social entrepreneurship is the landscape, of which paradigm-shifting solutions like microfinance, MSME (Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise) development, bottom of the pyramid, fair trade, impact investing, and the like, are components. This course will study many of these concepts, focusing on their opportunity for social impact, and as a vehicle for wealth creation in vulnerable and disenfranchised communities across the globe. Further, the course covers examples of various social enterprise models (for-profit, non-profit, hybrid), requiring students to analyze and devise strategies to improve the efficacy of these ventures. Finally, the course engages students in research seeking to advance the field of social entrepreneurship at the Keough School of Global Affairs and Notre Dame. 
IDS 30554	The course will compare efforts by humanitarian, development, and peacebuilding communities and actors to articulate professional ethical standards and codes of conduct to guide their work. The course will explore how the distinct mandate and structure of each field of practice shapes the form and substance of ethical norms and practices.  The course will also explore some common ethical issues that organizations working in these fields face, such as the ethics of fundraising and the ethical use of images.  The course will give particular attention to challenges arising when ethical principles and norms are applied in practice.  In addition to scholarly literature, the course will consider first-person narratives of aid workers and other global affairs professionals about ethical challenges they face in their work and case studies of humanitarian, development and peacebuilding action.  Students will be encouraged to consider how various ethical standards discussed in class interact with their own personal and professional values.
IDS 30559	This course introduces the role of economics in environmental issues and in the formation of environmental policy. Topics covered include choice, externalities, market failure, cost-benefit and environmental valuation analyses, and climate change. The course aims to encourage students to think about pressing environmental issues in economic terms and equip students with the diverse set of economics tools to contribute to the evaluation and implementation of wise policy choices. There is no prior knowledge of economics required, and students will have the opportunity to learn basic economic principles and frameworks that guide decision-making regarding environmental issues.
IDS 30831	Politics, markets, and the environment are all spheres of development that are fundamentally shaped by the action and interaction of many individuals over time. For example, the Arab Spring protests, the shortage of medicines in Caracas, and the rising water temperatures of the Baltic Sea are all system-level outcomes arising from the individual actions of thousands or even billions of people. In these spheres, leadership is often weak or non-existent. Scientists call these &quot;complex systems.&quot; Complexity is difficult to study in the real world. Instead, scientists often approach these phenomenon using computer simulations (sometimes called agent-based models, social network models, and computational models). The goal is to build computer models of development that link the actions and interactions of individuals to the system-level outcomes. This class will use the perspective, literature, and tools of complexity science to approach core questions in the field of development. 
IDS 30838	Fracking, Water Wars, Deforestation of the Amazon, Droughts, Global Warming, Climate Change, Unsustainable Agriculture, Hurricanes, Pollution, Species Extinction, Invasive Species, Poaching, Overfishing, Depletion of Fossil Fuels, Overpopulation, Wastes, Ocean Acidification, Wildfires, Oil Spills, Overpopulation, Overconsumption, Land degradation - the list goes on!These complex environmental problems are occurring constantly and rapidly; their consequences are global in scope and transcend national boundaries; and they embody the complex relationship between humans and the natural environment. This course is about developing an interdisciplinary understanding of the relationship between humans (society) and the environment. We will examine the historical and contemporary environmental challenges of global concern, the underlying role of humans, and attempts by society to address, mitigate, and adapt to such complex problems through policies, institutions, and governance. We will pay attention to the roles of different state and non-state actors in environmental policy making. Overall, students will draw from both the social and natural sciences to develop a deeper understanding of how society - through consumption, culture, politics, power, ethics, values, economic growth, location, etc... contribute to, or solve, environmental problems.
IDS 30840	Conserving the earth's rich biological heritage while enhancing the well-being of some of the world's poorest people stands as a critical global challenge. This course examines this complex issue using the lens of political science and related fields such as political ecology, gender studies, and sustainability science. It will demonstrate how insights and approaches from these areas of scholarship can help understand and address the twin problems of biodiversity loss and poverty in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Examples will focus on forest and wildlife conservation and management. This course will be of interest to students from a wide range of natural and social science disciplines.
IDS 30841	When India gained independence from British Rule in 1947, democracy was not expected to last in the heterogeneous and poor sub-continent. Yet, democracy has thrived in India for over 70 years. More recently, other South Asian countries have democratized. What explains this unexpected trend? Is there a connection between colonial legacies, international institutions and South Asian democratization successes (and failures)? After an overview of caste, religion and language in the region, this course explores South Asian politics by examining the historical and institutional development of democracy in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, including internal and external threats to democratic institutions. In particular, we will examine how the politics of accommodation and good institutional design have affected the persistence of democracy on the sub-continent, while also considering how non-state actors and international organizations have impacted outcomes. The course also takes a deep look at the degree to which findings from South Asia might be used in other parts of the world and relevant policy implications.
IDS 40460	What are Beijing's objectives towards the developing world and how have they evolved and been pursued over time? In light of China's unprecedented Belt and Road Initiative and increasingly assertive military activities far from its shores, the answer to this question is perhaps more important than ever before. This course analyzes and explains China's strategies in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Latin America, and evaluates their effectiveness. It is informed by the functionally organized academic literature, but uses a regional approach that allows for comparisons among regions based on their economic, political, military, and social characteristics. Topics will cut across the overlapping political, economic and security spheres, with particular attention paid to how different developing countries have perceived and responded to China's rapidly growing engagement in each region, but also place them in the larger context of Beijing's strategy towards other developing regions and the developing world as a whole. This course will be of great interest to students and scholars interested in international development, Chinese foreign policy, comparative political economy, and international relations.
IDS 40461	Water is central to the survival of humans and natural ecosystems. However, the scarcity of water has become a critical social and public health issue in the 21st century, and humans play a central role in transforming this critical resource. This course aims to provide students with a holistic understanding of the policy, governance, and institutional processes shaping human-water interactions globally. The course will cover topics ranging from water conflicts, climate-water nexus, water-sanitation-health nexus, politics of water use and management, the human right to water, water infrastructure and pricing, and other related themes through an interdisciplinary, policy lens. The course will also introduce students to relevant social theories, frameworks (for eg. political ecology, environmental justice, social justice), and methods for analyzing global water policy challenges.
IDS 40832	In this course, we will examine the creation of &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sexuality&quot; as objects of development practices around the world. While development projects often assume that gender and sexuality are stable, coherent categories of identity, scholars have long shown that both take socially and historically specific forms as they emerge through social practices. In this course we will read a range of critical case studies that demonstrate the complicated ways that local and transnational ideas about gender, sexuality, and development intersect in everyday life around the world. This course will help you approach &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sexuality&quot;—two key terms in development discourse and global affairs—with an understanding of how these categories shape not just individuals but institutions, processes, and practices.
IDS 40834	This class explores the use of marketing principles and concepts to support initiatives, causes and ventures that are social in nature. Attention is devoted to  the marketing and communication challenges involved when attempting to do good, and how these issues can be overcome without spending large amounts of money. Sample topics include identifying and understanding target markets for social initiatives, constructing a value proposition, developing positioning approaches, designing communication programs, use of guerrilla techniques, the roles of price and place, and how to set goals and measure performance. 
IIPS 20101	Armed conflict and state repression continue to occur across the globe, millions of people face overwhelming poverty, and systemic challenges like climate change imperil collective survival. Nevertheless, we have also witnessed the emergence of sophisticated civil society networks and social movements to address these challenges, as well as governmental and transnational institutions committed to promoting justice and peace at the local, national, regional and global levels. This course introduces students to the various ways scholars and activists define peace and the challenges faced in securing peace. It surveys: (1) the major causes of direct and structural violence; (2) various definitions of &quot;peace&quot; and the conditions under which it occurs and is sustained; and (3) the comparative success of various strategies such as building peace movements and promoting nonviolent social change
IIPS 20501	This course provides an introduction to the study of international relations and will cover several theoretical approaches to and empirical issues in the field of IR. Readings have been selected to highlight both traditional approaches to and more recent developments in world politics. The first half of the course focuses on contending theories of IR, while the second half of the course deals with more substantive issues. Empirical topics and subjects covered include: international security (nuclear weapons, ethnic conflict, and terrorism) - international political economy (trade, international finance, and globalization) - and 20th Century History (WWI, WWII, and the Cold War). In addition, we will examine several contemporary topics in international organization and law, including the environment, nongovernmental organizations, and human rights. We conclude by discussing the future of international relations in the 21st Century.
IIPS 20511	More than a century before African slaves were trafficked to the Virginia colony in 1619, Christopher Columbus transported captured indigenous peoples to Spain from the New World. The dispossession and enslavement of non-Europeans in the colonization of the Americas was justified by Christians but also condemned by Christians with different economic and political interests. This development course in theology introduces students to the challenging intersection of faith, slavery, and freedom by exploring key figures, events, and movements that have shaped the complex historical legacy of Christianity in the Americas, a hemispheric past that remains ever bound together. In addition to Christianity's role in colonial expansion and racial ideology, the course especially considers how lived faith in God provided a catalyst for the empowerment and resistance of the oppressed and their advocates in shared struggles to attain greater social justice, racial equality, and political autonomy. From the &quot;Protector of the Indians&quot; Bartolomé de las Casas to César Chávez, and the &quot;Black Moses&quot; Harriet Tubman to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the course explores these and other extraordinary figures of hope in the Americas who gave their lives to protest institutional violence and promote authentic expressions of faith. In the course, students will engage this turbulent past through a contextual approach to theology that examines idolatry, migration, land, liberty, poverty, social sin, nonviolence, and solidarity as normative categories relevant for addressing contemporary social crises afflicting our nation and the earth.
IIPS 20701	This course examines the interrelationships between economic injustice and violence. It begins by investigating the gap between rich and poor both in the US and worldwide. We also look at the history of Christian thought on wealth and poverty. We then address the ways in which economic disparity intersects with the problem of violence in both domestic (violence against women) and political realms (war and revolution). Next, we canvass Christian thought on the use of violence. This raises the question of whether Christianity itself contributes more to violence or to peace. Finally, we pose the question of whether forgiveness for violence is advisable or feasible. 
IIPS 20729	This course will explore the theology and practice of nonviolence as a form of askesis, or spiritual discipline.  The material will include readings from Scripture, the early Christian tradition, and Catholic social teaching.  Religious sources outside the Christian tradition will include Gandhi, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Badshah Khan.  This course will use the method of community-based learning and will require 20 hours of service at particular sites in the South Bend area.
IIPS 30205	This course examines the socio-histories, movement, and settlement patterns of racial minorities in America.  The course will focus on how race and racial imaginaries shape the movement and settlement of racial minorities. It will include deep examinations of these mobility patterns and how they are constructed and articulated through laws, policies, and social arrangements.  Special attention will be paid to the racialization of the United States, American-ness as whiteness, and the consequences for the social and physical landscape. And finally, the course will consider how the racial construction of America is manifested and buttressed through the built environment and the consequences.
IIPS 30314	This course examines why some individuals decide to become immigrants through a cost benefit analysis, viewing migration as an investment in human capital. It addresses the selection among immigrants and how they integrate and assimilate in the destination country. Primary focus is given to the labor market, and wages in particular, of both immigrants and natives in the host country. A distinction is made between economic migrants and refugees, and discrimination in its varied forms is also studied. Finally, the fiscal impact of immigration is discussed along with immigration policy in a global context.
IIPS 30316	This course will focus on the writings of Black political thinkers in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. Through critical examination of the conditions against, and contexts within, which the political theories of these thinkers are situated, this course hopes to arrive at some understanding of the principles, goals and strategies developed to contest and redefine notions/concepts of citizenship (vis-a-vis the imperatives of race/racism and the global colonial formations), humanity, justice, equality, development, democracy, and freedom.
IIPS 30327	Are human rights modern inventions or are they as old as humankind? Are they universal or culturally specific? How much progress, if any, has transnational human rights advocacy achieved? How and to what extent should human rights influence foreign policy? What are the advantages and disadvantages of encoding human rights in international law? By examining these and similar questions, this course initiates students in the study of international human rights. In addition to informative readings, intriguing podcasts, and interactive lectures the course features in-class debates on the most pressing human rights problems.
IIPS 30328	Incidents of hate-driven political violence and domestic terrorism have increased in the United States in recent years and are the highest they have been in decades. Non-partisan studies show this upsurge in violence has been driven primarily by white-supremacist, anti-Muslim, and anti-government extremism. What are the causes of this upsurge in extremism and political violence? What is its impact upon contemporary society, religion, and politics? What do the categories and practices of peacebuilding have to offer for purposes of constructive and transformational responses to such violence and its causes? This course explores answers to these questions. It examines how the causes and conditions of the upsurge in extremist politics and political violence relate to racism, nationalism, xenophobia, and the political weaponizing of American religion. We will explore such factors as the role of ethno-nationalism in the wide-spread Evangelical Christian embrace of QAnon conspiracy theories and political organizing, the merging of Catholic and Orthodox Christian &quot;traditionalism&quot; with political authoritarianism (e.g. especially as modeled by contemporary Hungary,  Poland, and Russia), the so-called &quot;Alt-Right&quot; organizing and activism (e.g. the &quot;Unite the Right&quot; marches and rallies in Charlottesville), the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capital, the relation of the so-called &quot;Gun Lobby&quot; to increased militance of political rhetoric and organizing, militia organizing and participation in political violence and terrorism, and invocations of a looming &quot;civil war&quot; as the inevitable result of deep and persistent political polarization in the U.S. Readings will include Janelle Wong's Immigrants, Evangelicals, and Politics in an Era of Demographic Change; Kristen Kobes Du Mez's From Jesus to John Wayne; Cynthia Miller-Idriss' Hate in the Homeland; Barbara Walters' How Civil Wars Start; Sarah Riccardi-Swartz's Between Heaven and Russia; and Ryan Busse's Gun Fight, among others.
IIPS 30329	This course provides an introduction to the history of American slavery. After examining the origins and transformation of Atlantic world slavery, the course focuses particularly upon slavery in the United States. Between the American Revolution and the Civil War, the United States grew into the largest slaveholding society in the modern world. U.S. slavery's growth was driven forward by massive global economic transformations and territorial conquest. Yet, in the face of unprecedented violence, enslaved people themselves brought about the end of slavery and transformed the meaning of freedom in the United States. This course focuses upon this history from the perspective of enslaved people themselves with particular attention to struggles for freedom. Through an examination of this history and its legacies, the course will introduce students to histories of resistance.
IIPS 30330	Diplomacy in its many forms is a way of doing politics: the established method of negotiating inter-state relations and of influencing the decisions and behavior of foreign governments and peoples through presence and engagement, dialogue, and negotiation. Diplomats are committed to their home country, but also their host country and the bigger picture of the common good. Contributors to peace building and peacekeeping, diplomats, serve political purposes through cultural engagement. In this way, they contribute to &quot;integral human development&quot; in the design of international relations. The Nanovic Institute invites undergraduate and graduate students to join our Diplomacy Scholars Program through Deep Dive Into Diplomacy. This course will examine diplomacy as a tool for social justice while providing students the opportunity to hone diplomatic skills such as conflict mediation, judgement and decision making, intercultural competencies, and written and oral communication. Students will learn from present and former diplomats about the diplomatic way of life and participate in a number of simulations and activities beyond the classroom. Enrollment in this course is by application only.
IIPS 30430	This course introduces students to the dynamics of the social and historical construction of race and ethnicity in American political life. The course explores the following core questions: What are race and ethnicity? What are the best ways to think about the impact of race and ethnicity on American citizens? What is the history of racial and ethnic formation in American political life? How do race and ethnicity link up with other identities animating political actions like gender and class? What role do American political institutions the Congress, presidency, judiciary, state and local governments, etc. play in constructing and maintaining these identity categories? Can these institutions ever be used to overcome the points of division in American society?
IIPS 30434	In a religiously diverse and vastly troubled world, how do religious traditions motivate believers to work toward the common good? &quot;Engaging World  Religions,&quot; the course title, refers to three things we will examine. First, it describes how religions are intrinsically engaging: they draw in adherents by fulfilling their material, intellectual, and spiritual needs. Second, it specifies what various secular institutions like governments and development organizations must do in pursuing the common good across our planet -- most of whose inhabitants are religious. Finally, it characterizes our work in this class: exploring how various religious traditions conceptualize and work toward the common good in a global context. We will read historians, social scientists, philosophers, and critical theorists on how to analyze and interpret the role of religion in contemporary life, while examining case studies of how religious practices, beliefs, and identities intersect with issues in global affairs such as inequality, armed conflict, and climate change. In doing so, we will engage how religious traditions from the East and West -- from Asian and Abrahamic &quot;world&quot; religions, to a variety of indigenous &quot;local&quot; religions -- complicate or complement modern Catholicism's emphasis on Integral Human Development.
IIPS 30442	This class analyzes the politics and cultures of remembrance in Europe from the late nineteenth century to today. Taking examples such as the politicization of Holocaust memory in Europe or the grassroots removal of monuments in Britain as points of departure, students will learn about processes of remembering and forgetting, and how memories of the past have shaped European identity and culture in the 20th and 21st centuries. We will pay particular attention to the mobilization and commemoration of Europe's traumatic pasts, including the World Wars, imperialism and decolonization, the Cold War, and histories of genocide, to investigate how Europeans have remembered these difficult histories and how these memories have shifted over time. We will look not only at how the traumatic past is represented today; but how memory work was enacted at the time and how Europeans have fought to revise these representations and demand new recognition of alternative visions of the past. In its focus on memory, broadly defined, this course will deeply explore how representations of the past have shaped European identity, culture, and politics both at the time and today. In its focus on memory and memorialization, this class also attends to the visuality and material culture of history and historical research. Students will learn to read visual and material sources as sources akin to political tracts, diaries, and memoirs. We will engage with sources including photo albums, monuments, memorials, museum spaces, memorial landscapes, film, cultural kitsch, and art all as critical primary sources to understanding the production and circulation of memory. We will read foundational texts on collective memory and remembrance to understand how scholars and theorists have defined and conceptualized memory. Students will also conduct an original research project on a topic of their choosing by exploring a case study of memory work or collective memory in the context of Modern Europe.
IIPS 30444	Fracking, Water Wars, Deforestation of the Amazon, Droughts, Global Warming, Climate Change, Unsustainable Agriculture, Hurricanes, Pollution, Species Extinction, Invasive Species, Poaching, Overfishing, Depletion of Fossil Fuels, Overpopulation, Wastes, Ocean Acidification, Wildfires, Oil Spills, Overpopulation, Overconsumption, Land degradation - the list goes on! These complex environmental problems are occurring constantly and rapidly; their consequences are global in scope and transcend national boundaries; and they embody the complex relationship between humans and the natural environment. This course is about developing an interdisciplinary understanding of the relationship between humans (society) and the environment. We will examine the historical and contemporary environmental challenges of global concern, the underlying role of humans, and attempts by society to address, mitigate, and adapt to such complex problems through policies, institutions, and governance. We will pay attention to the roles of different state and non-state actors in environmental policy making. Overall, students will draw from both the social and natural sciences to develop a deeper understanding of how society - through consumption, culture, politics, power, ethics, values, economic growth, location, etc... contribute to, or solve, environmental problems.
IIPS 30445	In 1964, when Martha Reeves sang, &quot;Calling out around the world/Are you ready for a brand new beat?/Summer's here and the time is right/For dancing in the street,&quot; was she beckoning listeners to join a party or the civil rights struggle? Or both? From spirituals sung by enslaved workers to protest anthems shouted at union rallies, music has provided the soundtrack to social justice causes throughout American History. Whether performed by rank-and-file reformers or famous recording artists -- from Frank Sinatra to Nina Simone to Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, and beyond -- popular music has accompanied and sometimes fueled transformations in American politics, culture, and social life. In this course students will explore American popular music in its many forms -- blues, country, jazz, folk, rock, punk, disco, hip hop, tejano, and more -- to understand its power and limits as both a force for social change and a window into major themes of the American experience.
IIPS 30582	This course asks how we should narrate and understand the great ordeal of Civil War and emancipation. Reading both primary and secondary sources, it considers the Civil War era and life of Abraham Lincoln in light of the rise of abolition and antislavery politics; attitudes toward race, slavery, and labor; the political and social meanings of war and emancipation; the political and social challenge of reconstructing the nation amidst the tangled legacies of racial slavery and a destructive war.
IIPS 30736	This course examines the interplay between history, memory and violence in the modern the Middle East. We will discuss specific case studies of violence and war and their social, political and cultural dynamics of commemoration, forgetfulness and silence. The course will start with an overview of theories and concepts emanated from the field of Memory Studies and then continue with our case studies. These will include the Lebanese civil war (1975-1990), the 1948 war that led to the establishment of Israel and Palestinian displacement, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the violent regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, the Armenian genocide during World War I and the Algerian war of independence (1955-1962).
IIPS 30924	Social Entrepreneurship has sparked dialogue and debate for two decades. Its very definition is much debated, as well as its capacity to create sustainable, scalable, systems-changing impact. This course explores the theoretical concepts, practices and strategies associated with the dynamic discipline of social enterprise and innovation. For our purposes, social entrepreneurship is the landscape, of which paradigm-shifting solutions like microfinance, MSME (Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise) development, bottom of the pyramid, fair trade, impact investing, and the like, are components. This course will study many of these concepts, focusing on their opportunity for social impact, and as a vehicle for wealth creation in vulnerable and disenfranchised communities across the globe. Further, the course covers examples of various social enterprise models (for-profit, non-profit, hybrid), requiring students to analyze and devise strategies to improve the efficacy of these ventures. Finally, the course engages students in research seeking to advance the field of social entrepreneurship at the Keough School of Global Affairs and Notre Dame.
IIPS 33101	This junior seminar is a required course for the supplementary major and minor in peace studies.  The course focuses on strategic peacebuilding, an analytical framework for investigating the causes and dynamics of conflict, conflict resolution and transformation, and post-conflict reconstruction and justice.  This seminar seeks to: (1) deepen student knowledge of foundational concepts and questions in peace studies; (2) introduce students to a variety of methodological approaches common in peace studies research; and (3) explore the relation between ethical, empirical and practical approaches in the field.  The course provides students with the tools necessary to carry out their later research in the peace studies senior seminar and encourages a deeper understanding of how their own research interests connect to peace studies.  This course is open to peace studies majors and minors only.
IIPS 33703	The course will adopt a broad anthropological perspective to introduce students to the cultural and utilitarian contexts of justice that speak to the everyday experience – urging students to rethink issues of education, health, housing, wage, economy, communication, environment, and spirituality, including the issue of justice itself. We will read some classic and contemporary works on justice that may have (or have not) garnered attention in a world emerging from a pandemic. By the end of the course, students will learn how to use the framework of ‘just-ness’ in things they do on the campus, at home, offices, marketplaces, and inside other social and civil arenas – and unpack their drivers as budding scholars in the humanistic social sciences.
IIPS 36000	This independent study course allows students to engage in intensive readings and reflection on a theme or topic within peace studies not covered by regular course offerings.  The topic must be pre-approved by the director of undergraduate studies, and the proposed study plan must be consistent with the number of intended credit hours.  A maximum of three credits (in total) may be applied toward the peace studies minor or supplementary major.   The coursework must be completed under the direction of a Kroc Institute faculty member, and the student will receive a standard letter grade at the end of the semester.  Please contact the assistant director of the undergraduate program for permission to register.
IIPS 40301	This course explores how social media and other new technologies are profoundly reshaping the world, impacting democratic institutions, social cohesion, conflict, and the peacebuilding field. We will engage in deep-rooted analysis of technology's positive and negative impacts on society, drawing on neuroscience, psychology, political analysis, and economic research of the profit models, affordances, and designs of current technology platforms. Students will analyze the impact of digital technology on fifteen global conflicts and explore twenty spheres of digital peacebuilding. The course includes a policy analysis of proposed government regulations on technology companies. Participants will learn through case studies and policy dialogues to identify best practices for using social media to support peacebuilding.
IIPS 40409	A major source of conflict - increasingly so - is environmental issues; both climate change-related conflicts about (more and more scarce) resources as well as secondary conflicts (conflicts that arise because of the resource conflict, i.e. climate migrants) pose a major challenge to the planet. Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato Si has offered ways to think about an &quot;integral ecology&quot; that takes the environment, life on the planet, the human condition and culture seriously. The cry of the earth and the cry of the poor cannot be separated. Laudato Si has to be read against the background of the concept of &quot;Integral Human Development.&quot; This concept, inspired by the works of Joseph Lebret, OP, was introduced by Pope Paul VI in his encyclical Populorum Progressio (1967). It refers to &quot;the development of the whole person and the development of all persons.&quot; The course explores the connection (intersectionality) between peace, (integral) ecology, and (integral human) development. It will do so with in-class room teaching sessions and working with select case studies on integral ecology.
IIPS 40413	This course will involve students, in a structured format, in assessing, prioritizing and creatively solving problems encountered by low-income and other disadvantaged South Bend entrepreneurs. We will employ a process-consulting approach and introduce a number of other useful tools and frameworks. Students will work with both for-profit and non-profit enterprises, producing tangible deliverables that help clients launch, grow and sustain their ventures. In addition to class time, students will meet with clients on a weekly basis at a Notre Dame facility located downtown, with transportation assistance available for those needing it. The class will meet for a normal session on Tuesdays. On Thursdays, students will consult with local entrepreneurs in one hour blocks during the evening hours at the Center for Civic Innovation. This consulting time is flexible with students' schedules and based on appointments made by local entrepreneurs.
IIPS 40416	What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films. Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba).
IIPS 40419	This class explores the use of marketing principles and concepts to support initiatives, causes and ventures that are social in nature. Attention is devoted to the marketing and communication challenges involved when attempting to do good, and how these issues can be overcome without spending large amounts of money. Sample topics include identifying and understanding target markets for social initiatives, constructing a value proposition, developing positioning approaches, designing communication programs, use of guerrilla techniques, the roles of price and place, and how to set goals and measure performance.
IIPS 40519	Although advances in science and technology have made tremendous gains in promoting health and longevity, these achievements have not been experienced evenly. Instead, devastating health and disability-based inequities persist, such as environmental racism and disability-based discrimination. As a result, social movement groups and organizations are fighting to protect vulnerable communities and promote civil rights. This class will therefore address how social movements have impacted the health and human rights of vulnerable social groups in the US and beyond today. To do so, we will (1) use a sociological perspective to investigate the structural determinants of health and the social construction of disabilities, and (2) investigate how advocates, activists, and organizations fight for good health and disability justice. This course will require participation in a daylong multi-fieldsite visit, weekly readings, presentations, and a final paper.
IIPS 40609	Understanding religious communities and their values are crucial to understanding human societies and global affairs. One particular group of interpreters of Islam, namely the traditional or orthodox religious scholars called the ulama and their institutions, are often hidden from contemporary accounts of Islam when in fact they are critical players. This course will provide historical contexts in order to explore how traditional Muslims navigate the discourses of modernity and how they resist it. We will read original texts in translation and secondary sources of descriptions of representatives of the orthodox tradition in regions of Asia, the Middle East and in the West. The course will pay particular attention to the institutions of learning known as madrasas, jami` and hawzas. Of course, the orthodox views are challenged by other Muslims and some of those debates will also be channeled in the class while the focus will remain on the Ulama. The course aims to equip students with analytical skills and the resources to understand how religious ideas impact religious communities and global affairs.
IIPS 40719	The primary goal of this course is to familiarize students with the tradition of Catholic social teaching with a view toward developing skills for critical reading and appropriation of these documents.  We will examine papal, conciliar, and episcopal texts from Rerum novarum (1891) up to the present time, identifying operative principles, tracing central theological, ethical, and ecclesial concerns, and locating each document in its proper historical context.  We will also hold recurring themes in conversation with the broader theoretical framework of Catholic social thought and relevant secondary literature.
IIPS 40807	In many of the recurring conflicts around the world, at issue are demands for justice.  Whether these revolve around economic inequality, political repression, environmental devastation, civil and political rights, ethnic or religious exclusion, or discrimination on the basis of race, class, gender, sexuality or disability status (to name just a few), social movements are often the carriers of these calls for justice.  In this course, we will examine how social movements emerge from, contribute to, and suggest resolutions for various types of social conflict, as well as explore their potential contributions to sustainable peacebuilding.  We will examine theory and research on how social movements emerge, escalate, consolidate and decline; how they choose (and change) protest tactics; how they articulate their visions and goals; how they generate emotions, solidarity and commitment; how they interact with networks of allies, opponents and powerholders; and how they influence (or fail to influence) agendas, policies, and regimes.  We will put a particular emphasis on the comparative study of social movements in different regions of the world, as well as on the challenges and opportunities posed by transnational movements that seek to organize across borders.
IIPS 40921	Scholars and activists use the concept of the &quot;carceral state&quot; to describe the official, government use of policing, surveillance, and mass imprisonment to exercise control over society. This course examines the histories, cultures, politics, and economics of prisons and policing in the United States, in order to determine how the U.S. carceral state has been a factor in the social construction of race, gender, and citizenship.  We will study the genealogy of the U.S. carceral state -- beginning with the surveillance embedded in the earliest practices of slavery and settler colonialism, tracing its development through the 19th and early 20th centuries, and concluding with the rise of the modern prison industrial complex. We will then focus on contemporary U.S. prisons, policing, and surveillance, using case studies including the &quot;war on drugs,&quot;  immigrant detention, sex-crime regulation, and police violence. Finally, we will consider alternatives to prisons and policing, as we learn about academic research and activist movements working to end state and police violence, abolish prisons, and create opportunities for restorative justice.  Over the course of the semester, students will learn about the historical development and ongoing maintenance of the carceral state, using an intersectional framework that highlights the ways in which prisons and policing have both shaped, and been shaped by, race, gender, citizenship, and economics. Along the way, students will ask and address such questions as: How does the U.S. carceral state function as a tool for social control? What histories, policies, and ideologies underlie the carceral state? How have individuals and organizations worked to transform or abolish the carceral state? How have art and cultural production been used to normalize and/or critique the carceral state? And can we imagine a world without prisons or police?
IIPS 43101	The peace studies senior seminar is a capstone course for both the supplemental major and the minor in peace studies. The centerpiece of the course is a seminar paper that students research and write on a subject of their choice in light of the theme of the course.  The course also consists of readings and discussions that explore familiar topics in peace studies in greater depth as well as introduce research methods to the students. This required course is open to peace studies majors and minors only.
IIPS 43507	Sociologists who study social movements and activism typically address questions about how disadvantaged groups are able to organize and engage in sustained protest in hopes of bringing about progressive change. In recent years, however, we have witnessed the growth of many organizations that aim to prevent change with hopes of preserving benefits that they enjoy. To understand this form of organized resistance to change, we need to closely examine how power operates in society to understand conditions that give rise to activism that resists progressive change. We consider the extent to which theories designed to explain progressive activism fail to account for conservative activism. The ultimate goal for the course is to provide you with the tools needed to formulate your own research questions and to engage with the academic literature to theorize your questions in a way that could lead to publishable research.
IIPS 45000	This course offers qualified undergraduates the opportunity to earn credit for academic work produced as part of an approved summer or academic-year internship.  Students are responsible for identifying and obtaining the internship, and the position and/or organization must be related to peacebuilding work in the field or have some substantive thematic connection to peace studies. The credit earned will not count toward the peace studies supplementary major or minor, and the written work produced will be evaluated as satisfactory or unsatisfactory by the director of undergraduate peace studies. Students seeking internship credit must contact the assistant director of the undergraduate peace studies program well in advance of the position's start date for details on coursework expectations and to arrange the necessary approvals and permissions.
IIPS 46000	This independent study course allows students to engage in intensive reading and reflection on a theme or topic within peace studies not covered by regular course offerings.  The topic must be pre-approved by the director of undergraduate studies, and the proposed study plan must be consistent with the number of intended credit hours.  A maximum of three credits (in total) may be applied toward the peace studies minor or supplementary major.   The coursework must be completed under the direction of a Kroc Institute faculty member, and the student will receive a standard letter grade at the end of the semester.  Please contact the assistant director of the undergraduate program for permission to register.
IIPS 47000	This course offers selected undergraduates the opportunity to assist in a faculty member's ongoing research project(s) for credit. Depending on the nature of the research, student work might include (but is not limited to) literature review and annotated bibliographies, data collection and field research, or more in-depth independent projects. The work will be graded, but the credit hours do not count toward the peace studies major or minor.
IIPS 48000	This course facilitates intensive independent research on a special, particularized topic in peace studies, under the guidance of an individual faculty member.  The course must culminate in a written, scholarly paper or seminar-length essay (20-25 pages) and at least one presentation of the work in an appropriate format and setting.  Credit hours do not count toward the peace studies major or minor unless explicitly approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.  Students should contact the Undergraduate Program Manager to secure permission to enroll in this course.
IIPS 50604	‘Islam and Violence’, and ‘Islam and Terror’, are familiar topics that have become increasingly popular in the media in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. These topics were spawned by events such as the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the attacks on the United States of America in September 2001, the Bush administration’s subsequent ‘war on terror’ in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Arab Spring which began in North Africa in 2011, followed in 2014 by the grotesque violence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). In contradistinction, to the plethora of courses focusing on Islam and Terrorist Violence, this course seeks to critically examine the Islamic theologies of nonviolence and peacebuilding articulated and embodied by a number of Muslim scholars. Students are not expected to emerge from this course as experts on the Islamic ethics of peacebuilding, but will be exposed to major Muslim authors and arguments on nonviolence and peacebuilding and be provided with a number of conceptual lenses that can be applied to their analysis of the diverse ways in which Islam is implicated in conflict, violence, and peacebuilding on both a global and local level. 
IIPS 50705	An exploration of how the voices of women have helped to reshape theological discourse and to bring to light new dimensions of the Christian tradition. The course will focus on the significance of gender and social location in understanding the nature and sources of theology, theological anthropology, Christology/soteriology, the mystery of God, and women's spirituality. The class will also consider the contribution of theology to gender studies. Readings will include selections from theologians who identify their work as feminist, womanist, Latina, mujerista, Asian and Asian American, post-colonial, or lesbian/queer, and/or those who are located in the &quot;Third World&quot;/global South.
IIPS 50800	In this course we will critically examine issues of trauma and healing as they emerge in conflict situations and as challenges to peacebuilding. The course will be structured in three parts. In Part one, we will examine how theorists from such different disciplines as psychology, psychoanalysis, philosophy and cultural studies have conceptualized trauma and the necessary steps to recovery. In part two, we will review recent anthropological accounts that have emerged from areas of extreme trauma. These accounts will provide the backdrop for assessing the adequacy of the dominant theories of trauma and healing models, especially when these models are taken into cross-cultural contexts. In part three of the course we will reflect on the implications of our examination of trauma and healing for peacebuilding on both the micro and macro levels. We will consider the challenges and possibilities for working with victims of trauma in various cultural situations as well as the reality of secondary traumatic stress experienced by practitioners. On the macro level, we will consider how trauma research might broaden our understanding of ideals of reconciliation, forgiveness and restorative justice, as well as the advisability of truth-telling commissions and war-crimes tribunals.
IIPS 60311	In this course we will critically examine issues of trauma and healing as they emerge in conflict situations and as challenges to peacebuilding.

IIPS 60412	In many of the recurring conflicts around the world, at issue are demands for justice.  Whether these revolve around economic inequality, political repression, environmental devastation, civil and political rights, ethnic or religious exclusion, or discrimination on the basis of race, class, gender, sexuality or disability status (to name just a few), social movements are often the carriers of these call for justice.  In this course, we will examine how social movements emerge from, contribute to, and suggest resolutions for various types of social conflict, as well as explore their potential contributions to sustainable peacebuilding.  We will examine theory and research on how social movements emerge, escalate, consolidate and decline; how they articulate their visions and goals; how they interact with networks of allies, opponents and powerholders; how they choose (and change) protest tactics; how they organize and communicate internally; how they project themselves externally via conventional and digital media; and how they influence (or fail to influence) policies and political process.  During the course we will examine scholarly research as well as documents and news reports on recent (and still active) movements around the world.
IIPS 70211	An exploration of how the voices of women have helped to reshape theological discourse and to bring to light new dimensions of the living Christian tradition. Using writings of feminist, womanist, Latina, mujerista, Asian, and &quot;Third World&quot; theologians, the course will focus on the significance of gender and social location in understanding the nature and sources of theology, theological anthropology, Christology/soteriology, the mystery of God, and women's spirituality.
IIPS 70220	This course explores how social media and other new technologies are profoundly reshaping the world, impacting democratic institutions, social cohesion, conflict, and the peacebuilding field. We will engage in deep-rooted analysis of technology's positive and negative impacts on society, drawing on neuroscience, psychology, political analysis, and economic research of the profit models, affordances, and designs of current technology platforms. Students will analyze the impact of digital technology on fifteen global conflicts and explore twenty spheres of digital peacebuilding. The course includes a policy analysis of proposed government regulations on technology companies. Participants will learn through case studies and policy dialogues to identify best practices for using social media to support peacebuilding.
IIPS 70221	Islam and the Abrahamic ReligionsIn 1965, the Second Vatican Council issued a &quot;Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions&quot;, which contains a statement that Muslims &quot;submit wholeheartedly to even His inscrutable decrees, just as Abraham, with whom the faith of Islam takes pleasure in linking itself, submitted to God.&quot; While the Declaration can be understood as recognizing the possible validity of Islam's claim to Abrahamic status, some scholars have introduced the notion of &quot;Abrahamic religions&quot; as a way of associating Judaism, Christianity and Islam as related faiths. This course will explore the defining features of the Abrahamic religions that tie them closely together as well as their particularities and differences. As the youngest of the three Abrahamic religions, Islam has a lot of things to say about Abraham which largely correspond to the Biblical story although the Qur'an also contains some novel features, including the claim that Abraham, together with Ishmael, built the Ka‘bah. This course will discuss how the scriptures of the three religions emerged within the same cultural milieu, and explore their intertwined histories and the ways in which Jews, Christians, and Muslims developed their own independent religious identities from their early encounters to the present. Students will also be introduced to some basic teachings of Islam. No prior knowledge of Islam is required.
IIPS 78102	Required of nonresident graduate students who are completing their theses in absentia while retaining their degree status.
IIPS 80200	This course will focus on methods in peace research and will expose the students to the interdisciplinary dimension of the field.  The course will build on the knowledge and preparation gained in previous Peace Studies required courses.  It aims to engage the students with theoretical and methodological issues of their partner fields as well as ethical implications in conducting peace and conflict research. Faculty members from the partner disciplines will come in as guest lecturers throughout the semester.
IIPS 80218	In this course, we will examine the creation of &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sexuality&quot; as objects of development practices around the world. While development projects often assume that gender and sexuality are stable, coherent categories of identity, scholars have long shown that both take socially and historically specific forms as they emerge through social practices. In this course we will read a range of critical case studies that demonstrate the complicated ways that local and transnational ideas about gender, sexuality, and development intersect in everyday life around the world. This course will help you approach &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sexuality&quot; - two key terms in development discourse and global affairs - with an understanding of how these categories shape not just individuals but institutions, processes, and practices.
IIPS 80220	What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds.

Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba).
IIPS 80234	This course interrogates the production, reproduction, and persistence of patterns of racial injustice that are manifested in many forms including criminal injustice, housing discrimination, food insecurity, health disparities and educational inequalities. The role of power, place, and institutions as ever-present factors shaping the social world and the matrix of social problems will be identified and evaluated to better examine how racism shapes conditions of violence, poverty, and suffering.
IIPS 80236	Across the world, millions of citizens live in territories controlled by criminal organizations that co-exist with democratically elected governments. The spread of organized crime across the globe has followed as many countries transitioned to democracy and/or ended long-lasting civil wars. Increasingly, conflict environments feature criminal gangs, drug-traffickers, mafias, and state actors involved in criminal activities. Informed by prominent theories and methodologies in political science, and the social sciences more broadly, this course will examine the causes of organized crime and its consequences or the consolidation of democracy, particularly in countries in Africa and Latin America. Importantly, a core objective of the course is to identify evidence-based policy approaches to address organized crime in developing countries. More specifically, we will examine theories and methodologies in political science, and related fields, that help us address the following six research questions: 1) What countries are the most and least affected by organized crime? 2) What is the role of politics in criminal violence? 3) How does criminal governance differ from other types of governance? 4) How does organized crime interacts with other forms of violence, particularly gender-based violence? 5) In what ways, does organized crime affect democracy? and 6) How have citizens and governments responded to organized crime? In brief, the course will offer an in-depth examination of organized crime and governance through the lens of political science and related fields in the social sciences.

The class is a continuation of Mariachi Ensemble I.
ILS 20303	This literature course offers an opportunity to read, discuss, and write about a generous sampling of contemporary American poetry by living Latinx poets, utilizing as its principal text the anthology, The Wind Shifts: New Latino Poetry. There will also be a special module on Latinx poetry inspired by Latinx art, with particular attention to the Smithsonian American Art Museum's exhibit: &quot;Our America: the Latino Presence in American Art.&quot; We will also be relying significantly on a series of online resources, including video interviews with Latinx poets conducted here at Notre Dame. We will focus mainly on mid-career writers, discovering and examining some of the themes that characterize Latinx poetry. A number of the poets who we'll be reading will be special guests, via ZOOM, at various points during the semester: we'll get to ask them questions, and watch and hear them read some poems. We'll also encounter poems that challenge what one might expect when one hears the term, &quot;Latinx poetry.&quot;   
ILS 20305	In this fine arts course we will read full-length books by young Latinx poets. We will discuss and learn from the them as we aspire to create our own literary art, in tandem with fun assignments, including but not limited to: writing to music, using a text from another language to write our own in English or Spanglish, visiting the Snite Museum on campus to use the visual or plastic arts as a springboard for our own literary art. We will also read and discuss essays on the craft of writing. The Latinx writers we will be reading will also be guests at special sessions on ZOOM, during which we?ll be able to question them about their art. Students will experience at least one literary event to experience literature as performance. Finally, students will practice and hone a certain vocabulary in order to offer constructive feedback to one another. No prior experience with creative writing necessary. All levels and majors and colleges welcome.
ILS 20701	This course will examine the Latina/o experience in the United States, including the historical, cultural, and political foundations of Latina/o life. By focusing on various Latina/o groups and the intersectionality of race, ethnicity, gender, class, and citizenship, this course will highlight the diversity within the category &quot;Latina/o. This course has an optional community-engaged learning component with La Casa de Amistad.
ILS 20812	More than a century before African slaves were trafficked to the Virginia colony in 1619, Christopher Columbus transported captured indigenous peoples of the New World to Spain. The dispossession and enslavement of non-Europeans in the colonization of the Americas was justified by Christians but also condemned by Christians with different political and economic interests. This development course in theology introduces students to the challenging intersection of faith, slavery, and freedom by exploring key figures and events that have shaped the complex historical legacy of Christianity in the Americas, a hemispheric past that remains ever bound together. In addition to Christianity's role in colonial expansion and racial ideology, the course especially considers how faith in God provided a catalyst for the empowerment and resistance of the oppressed and their advocates in shared struggles to attain greater justice, equality, and independence. From the &quot;Protector of the Indians&quot; Bartolome de las Casas to St. Oscar Romero, and the &quot;the Black Moses&quot; Harriet Tubman to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the course explores these and other extraordinary figures of hope who risked their lives in the Americas to both protest grave social injustices and promote authentic expressions of faith. To confront this turbulent past theologically, students will examine idolatry, migration, land, liberty, poverty, and the common good as normative categories with ongoing significance in the face of contemporary social crises affecting the most vulnerable peoples and the environment.
ILS 20901	The goal of this course is to facilitate student exploration of the genre of the telenovela. Students will sharpen oral and written language skills through exposure to authentic telenovelas from Latin America, reading of authentic texts, and through the creation and production of their own telenovela. They will hone their oral and written proficiency and learn the idiosyncrasies of Hispanic culture as they write, direct, act in, tape, and edit a telenovela. During this process students will also learn and apply basic videography and non-linear video and audio editing techniques.
ILS 30006	While race is a notoriously difficult concept to define, it is undoubtedly a powerful force in American life.  But how do we know what we know about race?  Where do these ideas come from?  How will matters of race and representation change in the era of Barack Obama?  Focusing on the late nineteenth century to the present, this course explores the ways in which ideas about race are formed, negotiated, and resisted in the arena of American popular culture.  From blackface minstrelsy on the vaudeville stage to contemporary comedy, television, and music, this course will ask how popular culture actively shapes - rather than merely reflects - American ideas about race and ethnicity.  Rather than emphasizing on a particular racial or ethnic group, we will more broadly examine the politics and practices of representing difference in the United States.  By engaging with a diverse set of theoretical, historical, and primary texts, students will learn to approach and analyze popular culture with a critical eye.
ILS 30010	This course traces the developments of contemporary art practice in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, and subsequently expands beyond this physical location to include global borders and artworks that reflect on living in between cultures, races, and languages. Students will develop a toolkit for analyzing the way borders shape culture and identity (race, gender, sexuality, class, religion, and ethnicity) in transnational points of contact. With an emphasis on printmaking, performance, photography, and film, the course will dwell on borders that respond to paradigms of fear and desire, contagion and containment, utopia and dystopia. Students will enhance their skills in visual analysis and writing, and refine their ability to conduct original research. No pre-requisites or prior knowledge of Art History and Latinx Studies is required for the course.  3 credits  
ILS 30013	Cinema and hospitality in a broad sense: how do films embody the art of welcoming, of hosting, of including and caring? Three months after his election in 2013, Pope Francis visited the Island of Lampedusa (Italy), one of the world’s deadliest forefronts of the humanitarian catastrophe often referred to as the global “refugee crisis.” He denounced the “globalization of indifference” in which no one wants to take responsibility for “our brothers and sisters” migrants who suffer and die. Ten years later, while the Pope is again addressing the “crisis” in Marseilles, in the month of August 2023 alone, 2,095 “migrants” have lost their lives in their attempts to cross the Mediterranean Ocean. Through a general concept of “hospitality,” our class will offer a holistic, cinematic approach to a world scene in which an unprecedented number of individuals are forced to flee their homes. We will focus on the (extremely) old notion of hospitality (a decisively matrixial one) and analyze films that put this concept at their core both formally and narratively. One critical goal will be to explore the various cultural understandings and practices that forge the highly cultural, both idiosyncratic and universal art of inviting, including, unconditionally hosting, and caring for the guest, the stranger, the child, the unknown. An ideal of protection, empathy, and compassion without which there is no responsibility, no ethics, all concepts that are the cornerstone of a feminist ethics that will nourish our research.
ILS 30027	America, at its core, is an idea. The lands that became America have been imagined and in certain ways and constantly reimagined. The history of the ideas that made America is less a lesson in philosophy and more about a series of clashes between contending visions: Democracy vs. Republicanism; Free vs. Slave; Christian vs. Secular; Individual vs. Society; and Universal vs. Particular. This course traces a long arc from the Puritans to the Culture Wars to understand the ideas Americans draw upon to comprehend the world and act in it.Lectures and discussions will consider the notions of equality, democracy, pluralism, religious freedom, and the tensions between contending visions for America. Readings for this course will include autobiographies, speeches, sermons, canonical texts, lyrics, novels, newspaper articles, and poetry.
ILS 30029	In 1975, the African-American writer Ishmael Reed put culture at the center of politics: “If I have you revering my art, behaving like me and adopting my psychology, then I’ve got you. If I’ve got your head, I’ve got you.” Confronted with the whiteness of U.S. publishing and school curricula, Reed and his peers saw literature as a key front in this broader struggle over the making and unmaking of American identity. Yet the question of literature’s contribution to the struggle elicited stark disagreement. Would it counter racial stereotype with accurate representation or refuse the burden of racial representativeness? Would it lay claim to the American nation on behalf of the racially minoritized, or throw in with different political horizons? Would it address the white reader unfamiliar with the realities of racial oppression, or the non-white reader seeking a different relation to histories already lived? These disagreements would only intensify in the following decades as the call for multicultural representation became increasingly institutionalized – with syllabi and publishing undergoing modest diversification, and universities framing racial difference as a strategic asset.    Moving from the late 20th century to the present, our course attends to how these political ambitions and desires informed the writing, publishing, and teaching of American literature by writers of color. It asks how these authors not only engaged in activism by literary means, but also reckoned with the artistic and political dilemmas that attended this doubled pursuit. To this end, the bulk of our readings will draw from literary fiction, non-fiction, and poetry, including authors like Gloria Anzaldua, Paul Beatty, Maxine Hong Kingston, Viet Thanh Nguyen, and Wendy Trevino.
ILS 30145	This course offers a critical examination of what it means to be an immigrant or child of immigrants through scholarly works, memoirs, blogs, and popular journalism. Since the liberalization of immigration policy in 1965, immigrants from Latin America and Asia are becoming an increasing and emergent demographic of American society. In major American cities such as Los Angeles and New York, they comprise over 50% of the population. This course focuses on how immigrants and the children of immigrants experience the United States. How are immigrants changing the US racial and ethnic structure? How do their experiences differ given varying legal statuses? How is the second generation becoming American? We will explore these questions through readings that focus on family, religion, education, dating and sexuality. This course will include a community based learning component where students will work with immigrant serving organizations. Students will have the option to teach citizenship classes or to work with immigrant children. Service will be 2-3 hours per week outside of class.
ILS 30202	This course examines why some individuals decide to become immigrants through a cost benefit analysis, viewing migration as an investment in human capital. It addresses the selection among immigrants and how they integrate and assimilate in the destination country. Primary focus is given to the labor market, wages in particular, both of immigrants and of natives in the host country. A distinction is made between economic migrants and refugees and discrimination in its varied forms is also studied. The fiscal impact of immigration is discussed along with immigration policy in a global context. 
ILS 30401	This course is designed to introduce students to Mexico's modern history and its people. We will pay particular attention to political and artistic movements during the Porfiriato (1876-1910), the Revolution (1910-1938), and the post-revolutionary period (1938-1970s). We will include a detailed discussion of the recent disappearance of 43 students in Ayotzinapa, in the State of Guerrero. Students will examine what it meant to be a &quot;militant&quot; in the political world of artistic production and social movements and the different ways in which the Mexican state responded to this militancy. We will explore how and why a broad range of representative leaders of Mexico's most important political and cultural revolutions used paintings, murals, graphic art, cartoons, literature, music, film, and graffiti to (A) lead a social, cultural, and political restructuring of their respective communities; (B) export their unique notions of &quot;Revolution&quot; to the nation and the world; and (C) question the contradictions that some artists (at times) faced within their own revolutionary movements. 
ILS 30408	TThis major-level course is designed to provide students with a substantive overview of Latina/o immigration and community formation in Chicago during the twentieth century, and how it became one of the largest Latino cities in the United States.  The Windy City's rise in the nineteenth century as an industrial metropolis transformed it as a magnet for capital, culture, and labor. A series of key events around the turn of the century and into the early decades of the twentieth century - the Spanish-American War of 1898, the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1920, the rise of economic production during World War I (1914-1918), and the Immigration Act of 1924 that greatly reduced Eastern and Southern European immigration - would come to shape the patterns, processes, and terms of Latina/o migration into Chicago, particularly those of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.  Mexicans and other Latin Americans joined the Great Migrations of African Americans and ethnic whites to look for better opportunities in the north, and since then, Latino Chicagoans have forged communities as they have also negotiated the broader social, cultural, and political currents of American history throughout the twentieth century.   This course will introduce students to these broader patterns as explored through recent scholarship on Latinos/as in Chicago.  Students will also read key primary sources in the field and consider the historiographical debates about retelling this aspect of Chicago's history.
ILS 30413	This course provides an introduction to the history of American slavery. After examining the origins and transformation of Atlantic world slavery, the course focuses particularly on slavery in the United States. Between the American Revolution and the Civil War, the United States grew into the largest slaveholding society in the modern world. U.S. slavery's growth was driven forward by massive global economic transformations and territorial conquest. Yet, in the face of unprecedented violence, enslaved people themselves brought about the end of slavery and transformed the meaning of freedom in the United States. This course focuses on this history from the perspective of enslaved people themselves with particular attention to struggles for freedom. Through an examination of this history and its legacies, the course will introduce students to histories of resistance.
ILS 30416	Scholars and activists use the concept of the &quot;carceral state&quot; to describe the official, government use of criminalization, surveillance, and mass imprisonment to exercise control over society. This course examines the histories, cultures, politics, and economics of the US carceral state. Reading feminist scholarship from across the disciplines, we will study its genealogy — beginning with the surveillance embedded in the earliest practices of slavery and settler colonialism, tracing its development through the 19th and early 20th centuries, and concluding with the rise of the modern prison industrial complex. We will then focus on contemporary case studies including the &quot;war on drugs,&quot; immigrant detention, sex-crime regulation, and police violence. Finally, we will consider alternatives to prisons and policing, as we learn about academic research and activist movements working to end state violence, abolish prisons, defund police, and build opportunities for restorative justice. We will ask and address such questions as: How does the US carceral state function as a tool for social control? What histories, policies, and ideologies underlie the carceral state? How have individuals and organizations worked to reform, transform, or abolish the carceral state? How have media and the arts been used to normalize and/or critique the carceral state? And can we imagine a world without prisons or police?
ILS 30501	In the past four decades, the United States has experienced an unprecedented rise in income and wealth inequality. Inequalities across multiple other dimensions (race, ethnicity, geography, and gender) are also pervasive. This course examines a multitude of questions related to politics, policy, and varieties of inequality: How has the American political system and the policies it produces affected levels of inequality in the U.S.? How has inequality shaped American politics and policy? What is the relationship between income and power? What are the political consequences of increasing income inequality? What are the implications of racial and ethnic inequities for the quality of democratic representation? Which policies increase political inequality? What are effective remedies for unequal influence? Finally, which institutions move democratic practice furthest towards full democratic equality and which ones serve to reinforce historical hierarchies? This course is designed to help students understand the political causes and consequences of inequality in America and consider potential interventions to support human flourishing for all. The course will be organized as a reading-focused seminar, with a combination of discussion and lecture rooted in cutting-edge scholarly research and evidence-based public commentary. Students will develop a substantial final research project that will be presented to an audience beyond the classroom. 
ILS 30502	Why have some countries in Latin American developed into democracies, while others have seen the rise of dictatorships? Why have some countries remained at peace while others are often at war? This course examines historical, economic, regional, and international factors that have influenced political development in Latin America.
ILS 30507	Incidents of hate-driven political violence and domestic terrorism have increased in the United States in recent years and are the highest they have been in decades. Non-partisan studies show this upsurge in violence has been driven primarily by white-supremacist, anti-Muslim, and antigovernment extremism. What are the causes of this upsurge in extremism and political violence? What is its impact upon contemporary society, religion, and politics? What do the categories and practices of peacebuilding have to offer for purposes of constructive and transformational responses to such violence and its causes? This course explores answers to these questions. It examines how the causes and conditions of the upsurge in extremist politics and political violence relate to racism, nationalism, xenophobia, and the political weaponizing of American religion. We will explore such factors as the role of ethno-nationalism in the wide-spread Evangelical Christian embrace of QAnon conspiracy theories and political organizing, the merging of Catholic and Orthodox Christian &quot;traditionalism&quot; with political authoritarianism (e.g. especially as modeled by contemporary Hungary, Poland, and Russia), the so-called &quot;Alt-Right&quot; organizing and activism (e.g. the &quot;Unite the Right&quot; marches and rallies in Charlottesville), the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capital, the relation of the so-called &quot;Gun Lobby&quot; to increased militance of political rhetoric and organizing, militia organizing and participation in political violence and terrorism, and invocations of a looming &quot;civil war&quot; as the inevitable result of deep and persistent political polarization in the U.S. Readings will include Janelle Wong's Immigrants, Evangelicals, and Politics in an Era of Demographic Change; Kristen Kobes Du Mez's From Jesus to John Wayne; Cynthia Miller-Idriss' Hate in the Homeland; Barbara Walters' How Civil Wars Start; Sarah Riccardi-Swartz's Between Heaven and Russia; and Ryan Busse's Gun Fight, among others.
ILS 30535	This course introduces students to the dynamics of the social and historical construction of race and ethnicity in American political life. The course explores the following core questions: What are race and ethnicity? What are the best ways to think about the impact of race and ethnicity on American citizens? What is the history of racial and ethnic formation in American political life? How do race and ethnicity link up with other identities animating political actions like gender and class? What role do American political institutions the Congress, presidency, judiciary, state and local governments, etc. play in constructing and maintaining these identity categories? Can these institutions ever be used to overcome the points of division in American society?
ILS 30902	This is an upper-division course for students with advanced preparation. It serves as the introduction to the analysis and explication of Spanish-language literary texts. Short texts in prose, poetry, and theatre from a variety of periods and countries within the Hispanic world are read, presented, and discussed. The course is a prerequisite for the survey courses, and must be completed by the end of the junior year.
ILS 30912	A survey of literary trends and major figures in modern Spanish-American literature from 1880 to the present. Readings of selected texts in prose, poetry, and theatre. Recommended prerequisite: ROSP 30310.
ILS 33042	The history of American education is the history of America! In the United States, we have a way of trying to utilize education to be a panacea for many societal things including poverty, race, class, gender, and so much more. Join this class to explore the overview of the history of American education and the societal issues assigned to teachers to sort out and how as a nation we continue to strive to find the ‘best’ system of education. This course will explore education themes from pre-K all the way to graduate school with a heavy focus on K-12 education and a look at disparities in the current systems and how those disparities evolved.
ILS 33301	In this course, we will challenge the single story/ies U.S. schools and curricula have told about books, characters, and cultural groups by focusing on literature by and about people from various populations that have been traditionally underrepresented in the United States.  We will discuss young adult literature from parallel cultures (including possible works by and about African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino/as, Native Americans, Middle Eastern Americans, and other ethnic groups), as well as literature by and about populations traditionally defined by class, religion, ability, gender and sexuality.  Course participants will investigate theoretical perspectives, issues, controversies, and educational implications for these texts, including race and racism, whiteness and privilege (in society and in the educational system), and critical literacy.  As an extension of the course, we will also examine the young adult literature market and how contemporary media may reinforce or resist the stereotypes, labels, and single stories associated with these cultures.   Possible texts include All American Boys, American Born Chinese (graphic novel), a Jacqueline Woodson novel, Openly Straight, a canonical text like To Kill a Mockingbird, Every Day, and several choice options, including a Classic/Newberry text, one text representing a non-abled bodied protagonist, and one contemporary text.
ILS 33704	This course examines the socio-histories, movement, and settlement patterns of racial minorities in America. The course will focus on how race and racial imaginaries shape the movement and settlement of racial minorities. It will include deep examinations of these mobility patterns and how they are constructed and articulated through laws, policies, and social arrangements. Special attention will be paid to the racialization of the United States, American-ness as whiteness, and the consequences for the social and physical landscape. And finally, the course will consider how the racial construction of America is manifested and buttressed through the built environment and the consequences.
ILS 33800	This is a leadership internship for Cross-cultural/Urban studies working 8 weeks in a multicultural area with organizations dedicated to empowering local communities. Students will work with ILS to build partnerships with the agencies and people involved. Students will complete academic requirements including readings, reflection sessions, and a presentaton of a synthesis paper at the end of the internship. Application and interview necessary for participation.
ILS 33805	Racial Justice in America is focused on the historic and current impact of racial injustice and the urgency of the work of racial justice today. Racial Justice in America will invite course participants to consider how the stories of the struggle for racial justice in the United States shapes our imaginations for the work of racial justice today. The centerpiece of this course is a required spring break immersion to major civil rights locations in the South. Additionally, students will read/reflect on how we tell the stories of racism in the United States and will create their own narrative/reflective account of their experience with racism and the civil rights movement sites.
ILS 33806	Solidarity and the City explores the principle and practice of solidarity in the context of U.S. cities. Students will examine the root causes of poverty and injustice in urban areas, will work on individual and group assignments that apply that learning to specific issues of justice, and will participate in a Spring Break immersion to a city to learn/work alongside partners engaging issues of particular importance in context.
ILS 33807	This course will take place in a local neighborhood and students will learn fundamental concepts and skills of community organizing alongside residents of South Bend. Together, neighbors and students will learn the art of organizing through relational meetings, house meetings, power-mapping, and research actions. The culmination of the course will include participation in a public action with local officials addressing a pressing issue in our community. Through a series of trainings and hands-on application, students will build public relationships, amplify their voices, cultivate power and leverage it for justice. 
ILS 33808	This course examines the complex contemporary and historical factors that obstruct justice and equity in the American education system. Students will consider the ways the persistent inequity in education interrupts human flourishing and inhibits civic engagement. Through conversation, reflection, and encounter students will begin to cultivate a vision of just education informed by an awareness of power, privilege, and positionality. This seminar will help students understand how assertions of dignity and concern for the common good must factor into innovations in both the private and public sectors of education to advance equity and achieve justice for all. This seminar includes a Spring Break immersion to Washington DC to meet with lawmakers, policy experts, and educational advocates.
ILS 40401	In this seminar we will examine the historical construction of gendered and sexual roles in the Spanish and Portuguese colonial worlds. This will entail thinking about gender and sexuality in the societies which &quot;encountered&quot; each other in the New World, and also thinking about how that encounter, as well as Atlantic slavery, produced new forms of gendered and sexual relations. Among the questions we'll consider: how was the conquest gendered? How did colonial society produce masculinities as well as femininities? What gendered forms of power were available to women? How did ethnicity and caste, as well as gender and class, determine people's sense of themselves and their &quot;others?&quot; What were normative and alternative sexual roles in the pre-modern Americas, and how did a European Catholic conquest affect these? Readings will include monographs and primary sources. Students will write an extended research essay in this class, and History majors may use it for their departmental seminar in consultation with the instructor.   
ILS 40601	This seminar provides an overview of scholarship on theories, methods, and research conducted on immigrant youth and their families from developmental perspectives. Topics will include a review of a number of developmental issues including youth's adjustment to immigration, adolescents' identity development, school experiences, cultural issues, family dynamics and well-being. The readings will largely focus on immigrants residing in the U.S.
ILS 40701	What does it mean to be Latino and who should be in/excluded from that category? Are Latin@s a “race’ or an “ethnicity” or an “ethnorace” or something else? Should we even be using “Latino”? Or should we use labels like Hispanic, Latino/a or Latin@? What about “Latinx” or “Latine”? And what do these different questions tell us about the lives of the more than 62 million people in the US who personally or whose parents and ancestors once lived in places as far-reaching as Mexico, Cuba, Argentina, and perhaps even Brazil and the Philippines? This course aims to answer these questions by examining research, journalism, and media that elaborate on how race and ethnicity are constructed within US histories and systems of discrimination, prejudice, nativism, etc. Students will study empirical patterns and theoretical discussions on Latin@ immigration, panethnicity, political behavior and mobilizations, and interactions with US institutions. In exploring theory and patterns, this course will emphasize how racial-ethnic inequality shapes Latin@ life, both between Latinx@s and other groups (like Asian, Black, and white Americans) and amongst Latin@s. We will also explore how racial/ethnic inequality intersects with other social categories and systems, including gender and social class. Students will further explore the potential futures of Latin@ populations in the US.
ILS 40903	We have recently witnessed a wave of debates about monuments (statues of military figures, explorers, conquerors, rulers, etc.). Moreover, many of those monuments have been intervened, &quot;vandalized&quot; moved, covered, and even topped down, fueling a series of controversies that invite us to reflect about the constantly shifting politics of memory and about the political effectiveness of pursuing symbolic justice in the public space. This is a Cultural Studies undergraduate research seminar devoted to a selection of important public monuments in Latin America; this is, statues, monoliths, and architectural visual signs that attempt to memorialize historical events and people as well as cultural and political values. We will examine their history as well as their paradoxical semiotic fate: no monument is able to install the memory it pretends to make eternal. Monuments are floating signifiers destine to be appropriated, re-signified, toppled down, and, eventually, forgotten.
ILS 40904	This course invites the students to explore the issue of identity as it is lived and thought by a number of Hispanic Caribbean thinkers and artists (essayists, playwrights, film makers, poets, and performance artists). We will pose the following questions: Is &quot;identity&quot; a useful concept for thinking about the culture of a nation, territory, region or community? How are the following factors used in identity politics or in the project of thinking identity: landscape and place, history (heroic history, the histories of suffering), the body, sacrifice? We will consider essays by Fernando Ortiz, Antonio Benítez Rojo and José Esteban Muñoz; poetry by Virgilio Piñera, Nicolás Guillén and Reinaldo Arenas; performances by Ana Mendieta, Carmelita Tropicana, Tania Bruguera and Carlos Martiel. All class discussions in Spanish. This course satisfies the modern Spanish-American area requirement. 
ILS 40905	The goal of this undergraduate seminar is to analyze Latin American literature in the cultural-historical period of the so-called &quot;modernizing impact,&quot; which covers the last two decades of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century and is commonly known as Modernismo. The journey will focus on the birth of the genre of the modern chronicle, a hybrid zone between literature and journalism, between information and imagination, between politics and the market. In Latin America, this complex object has brought together numerous critical perspectives that read local modernization against the backdrop of global modernity, whether as a dyschronic modernity (Ángel Rama), a disconnected modernity (Julio Ramos), a peripheral modernity (Beatriz Sarlo), a dissonant modernity (Gwen Kirkpatrick), a translinguistic modernity (Julio Ortega), or a modernity in translation (Mariano Siskind). From the discussion of these fundamental perspectives for the study of the field, specific prose texts by Rubén Darío, José Martí, Julián del Casal, and Julio Herrera y Reissig will be addressed. The chronicles of modernity will serve as a platform to reflect on current and relevant problems in literary studies, such as the representation of American cities, the crisis of modern subjectivity, the tension between the Eurocentrism of global modernity and American nationalisms, migratory processes, the phenomenon of secularization, the emergence of mass culture, the transition from the model of the &quot;nineteenth-century literary man&quot; to that of the &quot;professional writer,&quot; the role of translation, and the assimilation of cultural traditions foreign to the Latin American sphere. 
ILS 40908	This course centers Blackness within latinidad. In it, students will learn about the history of Blackness in Latin America, and how that history continues to shape the experiences of AfroLatina/os in the US today. We will approach Blackness from a transhemispheric perspective, paying attention to how it is erased through the discourses of mestizaje and latinidad. We will analyze literary and cultural works by AfroLatina/os with roots in Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panamá, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Perú. This is a CBL course and students will volunteer at La Casa de Amistad once a week. Open to non-Spanish majors who are fluent in Spanish or are Spanish heritage speakers. Taught in Spanish and can count as Modern Latin-American Area requirement.
ILS 40911	The first waves of feminism in South America during the late 19th and early 20th century were led by many women in the medical profession. Julieta Lanteri and Sara Justo in Argentina, Ernestina Lopez in Chile, or Paulina Luisi in Uruguay, to name a few, claimed for women's rights in terms of health and hygienism. At the same time, medicine emerged as a dominant and masculinized discourse within the nation-states that sought to control women's and non-binary bodies and behaviors. In the 20th and 21st century, medical discourse was also in the center of feminist debates about motherhood, reproductive rights, obstetric violence, among others. This course will explore the connections between medicine and feminism through the life and works of women writers and activists from South America, from the late 19th to the 21st century. We will read fictions, essays, journal articles, and medical treatises from the 19th and 20th century and debate on the role of medical knowledge in the context of recent feminist movements. Theoretical readings include Donna Haraway, Michel Foucault, Teresa de Lauretis, and numerous scholarly works on feminism, the history of medicine, and gender and sexualities in South America (Salessi, Lavrin, Marino, Guy, Ben, among others).
ILS 43501	This course will examine the opportunities and challenges facing Latino communities today as they simultaneously transform and are transformed by their continuing growth in U.S. society.  Through a careful examination of the biographies of leaders in Latino communities, we will examine what role they have each played in empowering Latino communities to advance in business, arts, education, community organizing, entertainment, medicine, religion, law, academia, politics, and other areas.  The course will coincide with the Transformative Latino Leadership Speaker Series sponsored by the Arthur Foundation through the Institute for Latino Studies.  Students in the class will have the opportunity to interact with invited leaders in several setting including the classroom, meals, receptions, and university-wide events.  The primary course requirement is a research essay about the life and career of a chosen leader.
ILS 46711	Independent faculty supervised readings.* credits 1-6
ILS 48900	Senior Thesis research and writing.
IRLL 10101	This course provides an enjoyable introduction to Modern Irish.  Energetic teachers in small classes teach basic language skills, prepare students to conduct conversations and to read authentic texts.  Extensive use is made of role-play and interactive teaching methods.  Irish 10101 is a superb opportunity to learn a new language, explore Irish/Celtic culture and investigate the linguistic politics of the only minority language offered at Notre Dame.  In addition to satisfying the language requirement of the College, Beginning Irish I satisfies one of the language requirements for the Minor in Irish Studies and the Major /Minor in Irish Language and Literature.

IRLL 20223	This course will discuss the 19th century concept of folklore and its application to Ireland, where it was largely framed by the cultural nationalist Gaelic Revival. Irish folklore has conventionally been understood in terms of three main and related domains: ‘oral narrative', ideologically the most important, ‘folk custom and belief', and ‘folk life', in practice most often the documentation of material folk culture. Each of these will be examined and problematized in turn. 
IRLL 20224	Boston Celtics (baseball), Glasgow Celtic (soccer), Celtic spirituality, Celtic music, Celtic art... The word &quot;Celtic&quot; seems to cover a multitude, yet also has a more specific meaning. It refers to a people of the ancient world known to the Greeks and the Romans and who left their trace in many parts of Europe; it refers to rich medieval cultures in Ireland and Britain; and it refers to a group of living languages and literatures such as Irish and Scottish Gaelic, Welsh and Breton. But &quot;Celtic&quot; also evokes certain qualities and characteristics such as passion, sensitivity, imagination, musicality and bellicosity, which have been attributed to the Irish and the Scottish Highlanders, for example, since the Romantic period. This course gives a concise introduction to the question of who were and who are the Celts. 
IRLL 30127	Course Description: This course offers a critical survey of the Modern and Contemporary Short Story in the Irish Language, 1950-2020. In addition to analyzing various literary techniques, themes, and topics, we study the development of the short story form from WWII to the present day. Starting with Máirtín Ó Cadhain, we focus on major developments in literary style, cultural controversies, and debates, not only for what they tell us about Irish literature and culture in general, but the wider impact and purpose of major literary movements such as realism, modernism, metafiction and postmodernism. We trace the impact of Irish politics, society, and culture on the short story form as well as various literary techniques: openings, conclusions, flashbacks, trick endings, use of tension, sentence structure, dialogue, pov, metaphor, and simile. Authors, whose work we study, include: Máirtín Ó Cadhain, Alan Titley, Padraic Breathnach, Mícheál Ó Conghaile, Joe Steve Ó Neachtain, Daithí Ó Muirí, Réaltán Ní Leannán, Biddy Jenkinson, Éilis Ní Dhuibhne, Sean Mac Mathúna, Fionntán de Brún, Roise Ní Bhaoill, Eithne Ní Ghallchobhair, Katherine Duffy and others.
IRLL 30128	This course will examine Irish poetry, written both in Irish and English, through the prism of protest. It will explore the public role occupied by the poet in Ireland and the concurrent anxieties and responsibilities felt by the poets who have occupied that role. The course will examine the formal prosodic dimensions of the poems and students will also learn about the historical circumstances in which the poems were produced. The course will include the work of WB Yeats, Seán Ó Ríordáin, Seamus Heaney, Máire Mhac an tSaoi, Eavan Boland, Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill, Paula Meehan, Liam Ó Muirthile, Michael O’Loughlin, Aifric MacAodha and Thomas McCarthy.
IRLL 30129	This course looks at the way in which Ireland is remembered. It will do so by looking at different sources of memorialisation. The course will examine the memory of the diaspora and the representation of Ireland through songs and memoirs.  It will be anchored both in the question of memory studies, drawing on the work of philosophers such as Paul Ricoeur. It will explore what gets remembered in times of commemoration of historical events, such as the 1916 Rising or the Great Famine. Students will also examine the notion of nostalgia. Other sources that will be studied in the course will be photographs, films, paintings and statues.
IRLL 30224	Medieval sources preserve amazing stories about journeys to far-flung and fantastical places told from the perspectives of women and men, migrants, pilgrims, colonizers and indigenous peoples. Accounts of Jerusalem, Purgatory, the pagan Otherworld, Ireland and even the Americas, highlight transformative encounters with new peoples, landscapes, and ideas. These stories also illuminate familiar anxieties and beliefs about place and identity, what it means to cross borders, to be exiled from home, and how that can change us, for better and for worse. We consider Celtic, Norse and British sources (voyage tales, Otherworld quests, pilgrimage guides, world maps) as well as contemporary works (Anzaldúa’s La Frontera/Borderlands) and speculative reinventions (an Inuit YA fantasy account of Vikings in America, films like The Green Knight and Howl's Moving Castle). Requirements include an exam, multiple writing exercises (creative writing an option), oral presentations, and 1-2 longer papers. No previous experience is necessary and all are welcome!
IRLL 30303	This is a 6th semester Irish Language course.
IRLL 30314	A cliché, a painful truth, an old story, a new one—this course explores alcohol and alcoholism in Irish literature, Irish society and Irishness, examining how alcohol infuses the stories Irish people tell and those told about them, and asking what happens if we take alcohol(ism) seriously as a framework and topic of analysis. We will think about the romance and conviviality of drink and drinking, pubs and wakes and more; and counterposed crusades against drinking (by Father Mathew and others), as well as the unromantic and destructive dimension so central to recent writing. We will think about alcohol(ism) in relation to political authority and nationalism, as well as in relation to colonial resistance, recalcitrance and recovery. We will ask how this &quot;inheritance&quot; travels into Irish America, and even to this campus, asking what legacies are being lived out, and why, and what we make of that. The course will feature a diverse set of texts across a span of Irish literary tradition, including medieval and contemporary, fiction and memoir, poetry and prose, verbal, visual and musical media. On the way students will work on their speaking, analytical and writing skills. Course work will include short writing assignments and analytical papers, a presentation, and a creative assignment.

IRLL 60224	One of the most popular genres of medieval literature was the travel tale, and Celtic, Norse and British authors created an exciting range of stories about far-flung, fantastical , and holy or heavenly places, and the experiences of quite normal people in these often really abnormal places. While these texts generally stage transformations, meetings, and confrontations with new peoples, landscapes and ideas at geographically remote sites, the narratives typically lead audience members to reflect on issues of identity and belief that are actually very close to home. Analyzing the role of travel and visits to different worlds across several types of texts (legendary histories and origin accounts, hagiographies, adventure and voyage tales, sagas, pilgrimage accounts, etc.) we will identify several of the universal attributes, styles, compositional goals and motifs found in travel literature. We will also explore the differences between, for instance, secular and sacred travel tales, with particular attention to the role of the audience, the reader who undertakes an imaginative, textual journey by turning a books pages or listening to a tales? oral performance. Participants will read both primary literary texts (all available in English translation), as well as a number of critical essays. Primary texts (some excerpted) may include but are not limited to Lebor Gabála Érenn (Book of Invasions of Ireland), Acallam na Senórach (Colloquy of the Ancients), Navigatio Brendani (Voyage of St. Brendan), Irish immrama (voyage tales), the Prologue to Snorri Sturlusons? Gylfaginning (Fooling of Gylfi), the Norse Vínland sagas, Geoffrey of Monmouths?

IRST 30351	This course offers a chronological survey of Ireland and the Irish from the Act of Union with Great Britain to the present day. It will consider the social, political, religious, gendered, cultural and economic aspects of that history, and will place the island of Ireland within its wider contexts, as part of the United Kingdom, as part of Europe, as part of the British Empire, and as the source of the global Irish Diaspora. The course will focus on a number of central issues, including: how enduring sectarian divisions have influenced the development of Irish history; the Famine, mass emigration, and the rise of the Diaspora; the development and course of both Ulster and Southern unionism, and of Irish nationalism; the relationship of Ireland and the Irish to the British Empire and the wider Anglo-world; the Irish revolution, counter-revolution, and partition; the development of the Irish Free State, and Republic of Ireland; the history of Northern Ireland, the Troubles, and the peace process; the collapse of the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot;.
IRST 30440	This course explores the history of the six north-eastern counties of Ireland which became &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; in 1920/1. Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and had a built-in Protestant unionist majority, while the Catholic minority, alienated from the state from the outset, looked across the new border and to Dublin, capital of the Irish Free State, as the site of their allegiance. Northern Ireland was thus, from the beginning, dysfunctional, scarred by sectarian violence and systematic discrimination in housing and employment. After examining the origins of the state and the early decades of it existence, the class will turn to its main concern, &quot;the troubles,&quot; which broke out in the late 1960s. The major episodes under scrutiny include the civil rights movement, Bloody Sunday, the hunger strikes, and the Good Friday Peace Agreement.
IRST 40529	In this course, we will examine the relationship between national and sexual politics through our study of gender and twentieth-century Irish drama. Beginning with the first controversies surrounding the representation of women on the Irish stage at the beginning of the twentieth century, we will study representations of gender and sexuality in the major canonical figures of the Irish renaissance--W. B. Yeats, J. M. Synge, Sean O'Casey--while investigating lesser-known female and queer Irish playwrights from that time such as Lady Augusta Gregory, Lennox Robinson, and Teresa Deevy. We will also look at how the treatment of gender and sexuality changes in the work of postwar and contemporary Irish playwrights, including Samuel Beckett, Brendan Behan, Brian Friel, Anne Devlin, Frank McGuinness, and Marina Carr. Along with the plays we will study their historical and cultural context and the sometimes quite vehement responses that these plays evoked in their audiences. Students will write three papers and do one in-class presentation.
IRST 46000	Directed Readings in Irish Studies facilitates a student's reading and analysis of a specialized set of texts under the guidance of an individual instructor.
IRST 48000	Directed Research in Irish Studies facilitates a student's research project on a topic in Irish Studies under the supervision of an individual instructor. This may include participation in ongoing faculty research projects in the Keough-Naughton Institute for Irish Studies.

This course must be taken twice as part of the requirements for a graduate minor in Irish Studies.
ITAO 20200	Statistical Inference in Business focuses on using data to make sound inferences about a population based on sample data, especially in business contexts. More specifically, students will learn how to make inferences using test statistics and confidence intervals in contexts of multiple groups and/or multiple variables, with multiple regression and related methods heavily emphasized.  Throughout the course, issues of sampling variability, research design, causality, and the assumptions and limitations of the methods are discussed. Students will supplement their conceptual understanding of the material using statistics software.
ITAO 20210	It is very important in the current age of automation and data-driven business models to have a basic understanding of coding, and to acquire some of the skills of programming. This course introduces students to Python, a widely used programming language among data scientists, with the goal of cleaning, modeling, transforming and analyzing data. Students will learn fundamentals of coding, use python packages for acquiring data from various sources, learn skills to slice and dice the data and produce data visualizations. They will gain experience in Python and apply these skills in generating reproducible reports in business contexts. In addition, students will have opportunity to apply programming skills and work on various projects/datasets that are pertinent to all the majors in the business school.
ITAO 20600	Businesses today generate large amounts of data. Analysts are tasked with using that information to identify trends and problems, improve decision-making, increasing efficiency and optimize business processes. All of this can be achieved using Microsoft Excel and its add-on Business Intelligence tools such as Solver, Power Query and Power Pivot. This course provides an introduction and structure to analyzing what-if scenarios, organizing big data, using relational databases and developing clear data visualizations all using one application - Microsoft Excel.
ITAO 30100	Business Analytics allows us to make sense of what we see in the real world by using data and a systematic approach to solve real problems and make business decisions. This course provides the fundamental concepts and methods needed to understand the emerging role of business analytics in organizations. You will learn how to properly plan an analytics strategy, collect data, analyze the data and report findings through visualizations and storytelling. Having a strong understanding of concepts in this course will give you a strong foundation in all the areas that support analytics and will help you to better position yourself for success in the remainder of the Business Analytics major and beyond.
ITAO 30160	The development of data insights utilized to create a competitive advantage, optimize processes and decide on strategy is increasingly becoming more commonplace in organizations today. Software companies have &quot;commercialized&quot; this process and made access to information from datasets available to anyone through easy tools and interfaces, yet this has created an environment full of noise, leading to a loss of the important insights necessary to create value. This course will provide a foundation for students to develop and effectively communicate clear visual insights and actionable data necessary for defined audiences using Tableau and other visualization and presentation tools.
ITAO 30220	The unprecedented availability of data and information now allows companies to rely on facts rather than intuition to drive their business decisions. Giant online retailers like Amazon.com investigate customers' browsing histories to recommend products that may be of interest to customers. Banks study the payment patterns of old customers to predict the likelihood that new borrowers will default. Wireless providers analyze usage data to predict customer turnover. Firms can make better strategic and tactical decisions and gain competitive advantages by leveraging the tremendous amount of data now available on the table. We'll study the tools and techniques these companies and others use to make better and faster decisions, and we'll learn about how methods such as data mining can be used to extract knowledge from data.
ITAO 30230	Relational databases store the majority of the information used in business analytics efforts and data analysts work with these crucial infrastructure platforms on a daily basis. In this course, you will gain an understanding of the key concepts surrounding the storage and security of structured data in relational databases. You will learn how to create, modify and query databases using the Structured Query Language (SQL). You will also discover how data analysts clean and transform this data into forms suitable for analysis using the R programming language. Finally, you will gain an understanding of the issues surrounding Big Data applications and the use of unstructured data in business analytics efforts.
ITAO 30250	You can find data everywhere, but that does not mean that it is always ready to analyze. Data is increasingly being saved in complicated structures, while also becoming larger. With this increasing complexity, analysts need to be able to perform any number of data manipulation tasks. In this class, we will start at the basics of R (vectors, lists, and data frames) and work our way up through iteration, functions, and visualization. Through our class activities, you will be able to more confidently and quickly work with data-related tasks that require high-level programming.
ITAO 30310	 Traditional strategies to fight against poverty, inequality and climate change have proved ineffective in the last decades. New and creative solutions are required where cutting-edge technological innovation and multidisciplinary work serve the common good.    In this course, you will explore the state of the art in AI business development and its ethical implications in relation to current global societal and environmental challenges. You will reflect on your individual role in society and develop critical thinking about the current socio-technical value system. Our readings will include original works of philosophers, economists and computer scientists as well as examples of state-of-the-art AI supported business and institutional projects. As a result of the readings and class discussions, you will acquire well-informed understanding about the implications of the AI Trustworthy principle of justice and fairness, including non-discrimination and avoidance of unfair bias. You will become aware of the potential for AI to contribute, if well managed, towards fairer and more sustainable societies as well as the dangers it entails to widen inequalities and aggravate the discrimination suffered by vulnerable communities.  This is a hands-on course where you will be ideating and planning projects for the social good. I will accompany you in the development of business plans where ethics is the driver and AI is the key instrument. I will help you define your project idea in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Therefore, your projects will be designed to work towards mitigating poverty, reducing gender and race inequality, combating climate change, improving the sustainability of cities and communities, ensuring affordable and clean energy, achieving responsible consumption and production, improving the quality of education, providing better health and well-being services, ensuring decent work and economic growth or promoting peaceful and inclusive societies.  The goal of the course is to encourage and support you, as new entrepreneurs and future leaders, to work in multidisciplinary teams and develop interdisciplinary skills, being able to take advantage of new technology to create and manage projects for ethics in action.
ITAO 30620	Digital disruption is reshaping entire industries in today's global economy. In this dynamic environment, organizations must be agile and innovate with emerging technologies to generate new value propositions. Using the concept of &quot;macro technology forces,&quot; we will explore how the past, present, and future of IT innovation tends to follow the same three-tiered architecture over the past 160 years: Computation, Information, and Interaction. This course will provide you with a frame of reference, or lens, to apply to business problems that will help you think about ways that firms can be digitally transformed.
ITAO 30630	Each day, organizations like Wal-Mart analyze hundreds of millions of transactions to increase efficiency and better serve their customers. We'll use market-leading Oracle Enterprise Database software to store and analyze large datasets just like Wal-Mart does. In addition, you'll serve as an IT consultant and build a real-world application for a client organization.

Social, search, content and conversion analytics will be explored and applied to maximize the customer value utilizing different tools such as Google Analytics, Customer Data Platforms, Content Recommenders and Data Management Platforms.
ITAO 40510	Data-informed decision making has created new opportunities, but also expands the set of possible risks to organizations.  One of these risks comes from grappling with the &quot;should we?&quot; question with regard to data and analytics, and associated concerns with identity, privacy, ownership, and reputation.  In this course, we will explore several frameworks to address the issues related to the proper roles of public law, government regulation, professional codes, organizational approaches, and individual ethics in performing and managing analytics activities.  The course will cover applicable theory and guidelines, and also make use of case studies.  Upon completion, the student should be comfortable adapting one of these ethical frameworks for use in alignment with their organizational mission.
ITAO 40515	As artificial intelligence (AI) grows increasingly pervasive in society, it is essential that we develop an understanding of how AI systems work. A vital part of this understanding is a careful consideration of various risks (e.g., the presence of bias, a lack of transparency, regulatory compliance) when AI systems are designed and deployed in real-world settings. To understand and address these concerns, this course introduces students to the fundamentals of AI auditing ? the practice of evaluating and improving the ethics of AI systems. Through a combination of interactive discussions and semi-technical lab sessions, students will develop an auditing &quot;toolkit.&quot; This toolkit includes both theoretical and technical concepts, especially relevant for the increasingly interdisciplinary teams of the modern workforce. Students will work on group case assignments as &quot;audit committees&quot; that reflect the needs of a variety of stakeholders (e.g., developers, managers, investors, users). Groups will identify and discuss potential concerns or risks associated with AI systems as well as develop recommendations to address them. Overall, the course aims to provide an interdisciplinary and hands-on introduction to AI auditing, allowing students to gain insights into the opportunities and challenges associated with the design and deployment of AI systems that minimize societal risk and increase their effectiveness.
ITAO 40520	Many industries are being created and transformed by using the techniques of business analytics.  With the goal of studying these techniques in some depth, this course focuses on one such industry: sports.  This industry has clearly benefited from the application of a wide variety of analytics techniques, and has the advantage of being widely and closely followed, with large amounts of easily-accessible real-world data.

This includes optimizing physical readiness and avoiding injuries, long term player development and the identification of strategic advantages in competition which can be targeted by both athletes and coaches.  We will use the R-coding language to develop pipelines for the analysis of the latest data sources. It is recommended that students have taken Machine Learning (ITAO 40420) before taking this class.
ITAO 40550	Broadly speaking, social networks are the patterns of relationships between actors. As actors in these systems are not independent, each actor influences the behaviors of others in the network. Our connections to others can determine a great many aspects of our lives, including whether or not we are employed, our happiness, and even our weight status. In this course, we will cover a variety of substantive areas in which networks can influence social life, including political behavior, innovation, inequality, power, and antagonism. Students in this course will explore the theory of network structure and function, understand how networks affect our lives and organizations, and will learn basic techniques for analyzing social network data. At the end of this class, students will have the knowledge and tools required to explore their own interests within the application of social networks.

Project deliverables can include actionable data-driven insights, presentations, reports, and analytic models.
ITAO 50850	Designing effective machine learning solutions has become an important topic in industry and academic research. In particular, human-centered AI - the design, development, and application of advanced machine learning and user modeling methods to human generated content including structured, text, image, and sensor-based data - has garnered considerable attention due to its immense potential to generate business value and improve the human condition. However, this value proposition also comes with a bevy of AI governance concerns attributable to the use of increasingly complex black box models. Using a combination of academic readings and real- world examples, this seminar-style course will discuss the state-of-the-art for human-centered AI. Students will be introduced to design frameworks and best practices for developing novel machine learning artifacts and measuring their utility with respect to model performance, monetary value, and humanistic outcomes.
ITAO 50860	This course provides a foundational framework for learning from data in a human-centered context and takes deep dives into methods important for modeling and understanding psychological, behavioral, and social science constructs. In particular, the course will consider the design of studies, measurement of constructs, and the analysis of data in a context that explicitly considers the human element, such as psychological constructs and behaviors, social contexts and organizational relationships, human capital and its impact on performance. The primary unit of analysis in the course is data generated by persons, possibly over time (e.g., to assess interindividual differences in intraindividual change) or in nested/hierarchical structures (e.g., teams of employees and their respective supervisors). The implications and limitations of using experimental designs and observational designs when designing studies, measuring constructs, and analyzing data plays a central role throughout the course. There will be a heavy emphasis on the design and analysis for explanation in a confirmatory fashion through the use of model comparisons. The general linear model and generalizations will be used throughout, from regression to analysis of (co)variance to latent variable models, focusing on multiple groups or repeated measures (e.g., panel or longitudinal). Additionally, the limitations of existing methods, evaluations of those limitations, and ways to extend the methods will be considered and studied, as well as understanding the implications of failing to meet the necessary assumptions of particular methods.

ITAO 80870	Actors, whether they are people, companies, or nations (or a near infinite number of other entities), do not act independently. They are influenced by the presence, attributes, and choices of their connections, and these connections to others form a “network.” Network Science is the interdisciplinary study of the structure, function, and dynamics of these networks. In this seminar, we will explore the graph theory at the foundation of network science, the core analytical techniques for the analysis of graphs, and the scientific application of network science across disciplines. By the end of the term, you will be able to apply network science theories and analytical methods to your own research interests.

JED 30147	A generation ago, students looking to pursue careers in media were likely journalism or broadcasting majors who could aspire to master one platform and work for the same news company for decades.  No more. People don't consume news in the ways they once did; the media landscape is changing. There are new challenges -- how to regulate misinformation, how to fund big investigative projects -- but also new opportunities. Digital tools are eliminating ‘start-up' barriers and giving storytellers more control over their fates. Aspiring news writers or producers no longer need to work their way up in a legacy company, hoping to someday catch their big break. You could manage a YouTube channel with thousands of subscribers from your dorm room. Some of you probably already do.  But how do you monetize such ventures? How do you turn a side project or a cool idea into a career? In &quot;Media Entrepreneurship,&quot; we'll explore how you can combine your passion and skills - skills cultivated as a student of the liberal arts -- to capitalize on media's exciting new frontier. You'll gain the knowledge, tools, and confidence to see &quot;being your own boss&quot; or &quot;launching your own brand&quot; as a realistic career possibility. And it's not just about you. When you hear the word &quot;entrepreneur,&quot; you might think of a guy pitching an idea to venture capitalists on Shark Tank. But, at its best, media entrepreneurship is an act of service. It's about building trust, meeting community needs, and expanding whose voices we hear as a society. In this course, you'll practice conceiving of a media project and creating your own startup business plan. I look forward to working alongside you.
JED 30150	This one-credit seminar is open exclusively to students in the journalism minor who are also in leadership positions with student media organizations. Students who meet that criteria may register for this course for up to three semesters, earning a maximum of three credits. The class will meet 10 times throughout the semester with a rotating group of visiting professional journalists who will critique student media work and help cultivate story ideas. In addition to feedback on published and broadcast work, the class sessions will focus on principles of news judgment and editorial decision-making, innovative storytelling approaches, and practical advice for reporting on complex or controversial subjects. The visiting journalists also will provide insights and examples from their own work and offer advice on establishing a career in the news industry.
JED 30151	Taught by former ESPN anchor, Emmy award-winning sports reporter, and President of Game Day Communications Betsy Ross, Game Day Media will delve into the preparation and performance of game day media opportunities: play by play personnel, color analysts, Public Address talent, news conference moderators and more.

JED 30152	In a new book about her work as longtime obituary writer for the Economist, Ann Wroe dubs the task &quot;catching lives&quot;: i.e., capturing and conveying the crucial elements that illuminate a subject's personality, behavior, motivation, and even their soul. We will explore journalistic techniques, along with ethical and even moral considerations, in the writing of lives, both the living and the dead, in formal biographies, in informal profiles, in obituaries, and in appreciations. From current books such as His Name Is George Floyd and Elon Musk and Going Infinite, to the pithy profiles of contemporary figures written on deadline in the wake of news events, how do life-writers — who must be part detective, part psychoanalyst, part historian, and part gossip-trawler, but always fair and thorough — go about their work?
JED 45900	Apprentice training with Notre Dame Magazine
JED 47931	Special Studies offers students the opportunity to pursue an independent, semester-long reading or research project under the direction of a faculty member. The subject matter of special studies must not be duplicated in the regular curriculum.

It begins with a survey of the history of investigative reporting, from early 20th century muckrakers like Upton Sinclair to Woodward and Bernstein to new models in today's online world. Students will learn how to identify and judge potential investigative topics, work with databases to find solid documentation, interview a wide range of sources, and write stories appropriate to different journalism platforms. Students will work toward producing a piece that is publishable in a local newspaper or website.
KSGA 20000	This course introduces global affairs students to culture as an analytic tool to interpret social differences within and across communities, from local to global. Building on insights from anthropology, sociology, history, and other disciplines, we will examine key themes in global affairs such as &quot;development,&quot; &quot;progress,&quot; and &quot;policy,&quot; in light of what a culturally-informed perspective offers to our understanding of these topics. Over the semester, students will learn to identify and describe the role of cultural difference in shaping global affairs, and to analyze contemporary debates in global affairs in light of culture, power, and inequality. Finally, through independent research, students will develop their own set of critical questions to prepare for their future cultural immersion experiences and scholarship.
KSGA 20002	This course introduces students to the field of social-cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropologists are primarily interested in exploring issues of human cultural diversity across cultures and through time. This course will explore key theoretical, topical, and ethical issues of interest to cultural anthropologists. We will examine diverse ways in which people around the globe have constructed social organizations (such as kinship, and political and economic systems) and cultural identities (such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, race, and class) and we will consider the impact of increasing globalization on such processes. Throughout the course we will consider how different anthropologists go about their work as they engage in research and as they represent others through the writing of ethnographies.
KSGA 20200	When India gained independence from British Rule in 1947, democracy was not expected to last in the heterogeneous and poor sub-continent.  Yet, democracy has thrived in India for over 70 years.  More recently, other South Asian countries have democratized.  What explains this unexpected trend?  Is there a connection between colonial legacies, international institutions and South Asian democratization successes (and failures)?  After an overview of caste, religion and language in the region, this course explores South Asian politics by examining the historical and institutional development of democracy in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, including internal and external threats to democratic institutions.  In particular, we will examine how the politics of accommodation and good institutional design have affected the persistence of democracy on the sub-continent, while also considering how non-state actors and international organizations have impacted outcomes.  The course also takes a deep look at the degree to which findings from South Asia might be used in other parts of the world and relevant policy implications.
KSGA 20300	What does it mean to be Korean? How are definitions of Korea and “Koreanness” affected by recent waves of globalization and migration? This course investigates the social construction of race and nationhood within the context of South Korea. While many believe South Korea to be ethnically and racially homogeneous, the country has increasingly opened up its borders to foreign migration to offset the adverse impact of its rapidly aging society. More than one in ten marriages in South Korea involves a foreign-born person today, and growing numbers of racially mixed people consider themselves Korean. In addition, members of the Korean diaspora have started to “return” to their country of origin in recent years, only to find that they are marginalized because of their culturally different backgrounds. This course introduces students to sociological theories of race, ethnicity, and nationhood by analyzing how South Koreans define self and Other. We will learn how racial and ethnic identities continue to evolve as the contexts of migration change. We will also learn why it is difficult for individuals of particular backgrounds to find a sense of belonging in the societies in which they live and work.
KSGA 20600	Understanding religious communities and their values are crucial to understanding human societies and global affairs. One particular group of interpreters of Islam, namely the traditional or orthodox religious scholars called the ulama and their institutions, are often hidden from contemporary accounts of Islam when in fact they are critical players. This course will provide historical contexts in order to explore how traditional Muslims navigate the discourses of modernity and how they resist it. We will read original texts in translation and secondary sources of descriptions of representatives of the orthodox tradition in regions of Asia, the Middle East and in the West. The course will pay particular attention to the institutions of learning known as madrasas, jami` and hawzas. Of course, the orthodox views are challenged by other Muslims and some of those debates will also be channeled in the class while the focus will remain on the Ulama. The course aims to equip students with analytical skills and the resources to understand how religious ideas impact religious communities and global affairs.    
KSGA 23000	The Keough Ethical Practice Seminar analyzes the practice of ethical reasoning and analysis in professional and public settings relevant to global affairs. The course focuses on Integral Human Development in practice and applied ethics and employs the IHD framework for making ethical decisions in specific types of global professional settings, such as humanitarian relief delivery, development projects, policy making, human rights advocacy and the like, each with its own professional ethical standards that are both internally and externally contested. The course will ask students to consider real-life ethical dilemmas and to reflect on the relationship of professional ethics, the social-ethical framework, and their own values.
KSGA 23100	This will be a problem-oriented, interdisciplinary seminar that will develop critical thinking and communication skills.
KSGA 30001	Understanding the complex ways economies are interconnected through the flow of goods, services, people and capital is increasingly important in this era of globalization. This course introduces students to basic ideas, concepts, and models in international trade and international finance, building on their knowledge of the principles of economics. Among the topics covered are the sources of gains from trade, the impact of globalization on income inequality, the welfare effects and political economy of trade policy, the determinants of the trade balance, the role of the exchange rate in adjustment to economic shocks, and the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy in open economies. Special attention will be given to developing countries as well as the lessons from the Eurozone crisis. Assignments will include problem sets as well as empirical exercises, which provide an opportunity for students to improve their skills in analyzing economic data.
KSGA 30005	Politics, markets, and the environment are all spheres of development that are fundamentally shaped by the action and interaction of many individuals over time. For example, the Arab Spring protests, the shortage of medicines in Caracas, and the rising water temperatures of the Baltic Sea are all system-level outcomes arising from the individual actions of thousands or even billions of people. In these spheres, leadership is often weak or non-existent. Scientists call these &quot;complex systems.&quot;  Complexity is difficult to study in the real world. Instead, scientists often approach these phenomenon using computer simulations (sometimes called agent-based models, social network models, and computational models). The goal is to build computer models of development that link the actions and interactions of individuals to the system-level outcomes. This class will use the perspective, literature, and tools of complexity science to approach core questions in the field of development.  No programming experience is required, but students should be prepared to learn a new language called Netlogo. It is a free program which is described as having a &quot;low threshold&quot; (easy to get started) and &quot;high ceiling&quot; (many capabilities).
KSGA 30202	Conserving the earth's rich biological heritage while enhancing the well-being of some of the world's poorest people stands as a critical global challenge. This course examines this complex issue using the lens of political science and related fields such as political ecology, gender studies, and sustainability science. It will demonstrate how insights and approaches from these areas of scholarship can help understand and address the twin problems of biodiversity loss and poverty in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Examples will focus on forest and wildlife conservation and management. This course will be of interest to students from a wide range of natural and social science disciplines.
KSGA 30203	Are human rights modern inventions or are they as old as humankind? Are they universal or culturally specific? How much progress, if any, has transnational human rights advocacy achieved? How and to what extent should human rights influence foreign policy? What are the advantages and disadvantages of encoding human rights in international law? By examining these and similar questions, this course initiates students in the study of international human rights. In addition to informative readings, intriguing podcasts, and interactive lectures the course features in-class debates on the most pressing human rights problems.
KSGA 30310	Many people predict that the 21st century will be the &quot;Asian Century,&quot; dominated by China, India, and other nation-states on the continent. What does it mean to imagine an Asian future? In this class, we answer this question by rethinking connections between past, present, and future, both within and between different nations in Asia. How can we better understand the global connections between past and present if we take Asia, rather than Europe and North America, as our starting point? By contextualizing contemporary issues in Asia within global social and historical context, students will learn to move beyond common stereotypes about the region. We will use materials from history, anthropology, religion, and literature to explore the impacts of colonialism, nationalism, and globalization on everyday life across the continent. Through this course, students will learn how to analyze the intersections of personal, local, regional, and global contexts in order to better explain how Asia shapes our world. All majors and backgrounds are welcome. No prior knowledge about Asian languages or topics is required.
KSGA 30400	Policymaking for a Global Era provides students with the intellectual foundations necessary to understand the dilemmas and opportunities faced by decision-makers during the policymaking process. The course has three modules. The first investigates how policymakers' world views and choices are shaped by experimental, cultural, normative and decision making structures. It also examines how regime type and country size constrain policymakers' options. The second module examines the numerous domestic and international actors and factors that influence the foreign policymaking process in the U.S. - including the presidency, intelligence services, the Congress, media, NGOs, international institutions, and foreign governments. In the third module we study policymaking in three Asian countries - China, India, and Vietnam. This comparative approach illustrates how elements such as culture, country size, and regime type, which were introduced in the first module, affect these countries foreign policymakers' decisions. The course concludes with a policymaking crisis simulation that employs the lessons learned throughout the course. The course assignments are three 5-page policy memoranda and robust class participation.
KSGA 30408	Fracking, Water Wars, Deforestation of the Amazon, Droughts, Global Warming, Climate Change, Unsustainable Agriculture, Hurricanes, Pollution, Species Extinction, Invasive Species, Poaching, Overfishing, Depletion of Fossil Fuels, Overpopulation, Wastes, Ocean Acidification, Wildfires, Oil Spills, Overpopulation, Overconsumption, Land degradation - the list goes on!  These complex environmental problems are occurring constantly and rapidly; their consequences are global in scope and transcend national boundaries; and they embody the complex relationship between humans and the natural environment. This course is about developing an interdisciplinary understanding of the relationship between humans (society) and the environment. We will examine the historical and contemporary environmental challenges of global concern, the underlying role of humans, and attempts by society to address, mitigate, and adapt to such complex problems through policies, institutions, and governance. We will pay attention to the roles of different state and non-state actors in environmental policy making. Overall, students will draw from both the social and natural sciences to develop a deeper understanding of how society - through consumption, culture, politics, power, ethics, values, economic growth, location, etc... contribute to, or solve, environmental problems.
KSGA 30411	The application of artificial intelligence is expanding rapidly and has the potential to reshape many fields, including transportation, finance, health care, marketing, social media, criminal justice, and public policy, just to name a few. AI's ability to predict human preference and behavior or even substitute human judgement in these fields creates opportunities as well as concerns for safety, bias and discrimination, transparency, inequality, and job loss. Designed to serve students from no background in AI to those who have existing technical background, this course surveys current and emerging applications of AI in different fields and the related ethical issues and governance problems. The course targets students from different disciplines. Students from the humanities and social sciences will gain a deeper understanding of the technical aspects underpinning today's ethical and policy debates related to AI. Students with more technical background will better appreciate the ethical issues that arise in programming and engineering and understand how technology interacts with the broader societal contexts. The course's goal is to encourage students to become proactive in thinking of the societal implications of technological change and to incorporate such understanding in their education and careers.
KSGA 30412	The course will examine U.S. policies and practices to combat human trafficking including how U.S. policies advance the prevention of trafficking in persons, the protection of victims and survivors and the punishment of perpetrators as a foreign policy objective of the U.S.  Students will develop a basic understanding of the various aspects of and perspectives in human trafficking including domestic and international law; foreign nationals and United States Citizens; victim services, survivor aftercare and law enforcement and sex and labor trafficking. Students will also analyze international trafficking prohibitions under the various international conventions and identify current trafficking issues in the United States, with a particular focus on commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor and involuntary servitude and the range of remedies available when rights have been violated.  Finally, students will identify gaps in existing remedies and formulate policies to address them.
KSGA 30415	This course introduces the role of economics in environmental issues and in the formation of environmental policy. Topics covered include choice, externalities, market failure, cost-benefit and environmental valuation analyses, and climate change. The course aims to encourage students to think about pressing environmental issues in economic terms and equip students with the diverse set of economics tools to contribute to the evaluation and implementation of wise policy choices. There is no prior knowledge of economics required, and students will have the opportunity to learn basic economic principles and frameworks that guide decision-making regarding environmental issues.
KSGA 30493	This course explores the myriad of national security policy challenges facing the United States and the policy options to address these challenges.

The course will include lectures by policy experts and student engagement with these experts to explore policy options and their potential for success. Students will conduct research of primary source policy documents to develop  a policy memorandum for the US National Security Council that will outline a policy challenge for the United States and recommend policy options for consideration.
KSGA 30496	This course will explore the role of global business in reducing poverty, inequality and attending to the needs of all stakeholders. Students will be introduced to the rapidly growing fields of impact investing and sustainable finance which support socially conscious and environmentally friendly innovations. Students will gain a broad overview of the financial and economic tools available, beyond government assistance and philanthropy, to support broad based wealth creation, equality of opportunity and natural resource preservation. Students will be invited to participate in policy debates on certain topics and will read mini case studies on subjects such as microfinance, &quot;place based&quot; community investment and the role of CDFIs, and the issuance of green/blue sustainability bonds. Guest speakers/practitioners will be invited to engage the students in real world problem solving. The course will culminate in a small group project or paper to &quot;reexamine business&quot; as a force for good, which will be presented in class. It is open to students of all intended majors with no prerequisites, and should serve as a foray to several future areas of study such as global affairs, social entrepreneurship and sustainability.
KSGA 30600	In a religiously diverse and vastly troubled world, how do religious traditions motivate believers to work toward the common good? &quot;Engaging World  Religions,&quot; the course title, refers to three things we will examine. First, it describes how religions are intrinsically engaging: they draw in adherents by fulfilling their material, intellectual, and spiritual needs. Second, it specifies what various secular institutions like governments and development organizations must do in pursuing the common good across our planet -- most of whose inhabitants are religious. Finally, it characterizes our work in this class: exploring how various religious traditions conceptualize and work toward the common good in a global context. We will read historians, social scientists, philosophers, and critical theorists on how to analyze and interpret the role of religion in contemporary life, while examining case studies of how religious practices, beliefs, and identities intersect with issues in global affairs such as inequality, armed conflict, and climate change. In doing so, we will engage how religious traditions from the East and West -- from Asian and Abrahamic &quot;world&quot; religions, to a variety of indigenous &quot;local&quot; religions -- complicate or complement modern Catholicism's emphasis on Integral Human Development.
KSGA 30709	Civil Rights in the US is a living tradition that students can both understand and engage with. This course traces the non-linear, contested and ongoing history of Civil Rights in the US from the founding period to the present. It employs the perspectives of a lawyer and historian to illustrate how: the Civil War and the end of slavery made Civil Rights in the US possible, international human rights and Civil Rights in the US have interacted over time; the complicated relationship between the definition of Civil Rights and the realization of these rights played out over time, and the tensions between the federal government and the states continue to shape Civil Rights down to the present. The course is structured around three key historical periods in which Civil Rights in the US developed and the divisive legacy of these periods of possibility: The Founding and Constitutional period 1776-1790, Civil War and Reconstruction, 1863-1883 and the Civil Rights Era 1945-1991. Through an examination of social movements, Supreme Court cases, and congressional action the course illustrates how the meaning of citizenship and civil rights, who constituted a citizen, and what institutions—state and local government, private individuals, and so on—posed the biggest threat to equal treatment under the law changed over time. Finally, the course provides opportunities for students to actively participate in the US Civil Rights tradition.
KSGA 40301	What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films. Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba).
KSGA 40403	At a moment when global challenges - from climate change to inclusive development to public health threats - loom large, many nation-states seem unable to come together to address them. In what ways are the world's cities and subnational governments working on their own and in concert to meet these challenges? This course examines the distinctive roles and capacities of cities, provinces, and states in managing global policy issues and explores different modes of trans-local cooperation and coordination. We start by considering the global governance shortcomings of nation-states and exploring the multilevel character of key policy challenges. We next use case studies from different issue-areas to assess how action by subnational governments is contributing to but also complicating solutions. We conclude by discussing the limitations of subnational approaches to global challenges and considering the most appropriate policy roles and portfolios for subnational actors in the 21st century.
KSGA 40408	The new wave of technologies, e.g., robotics and AI will have long-lasting impacts on the labor market. Jobs will be displaced, new tasks will be created, different skills will be demanded, and new management practices will emerge. These new technologies may benefit workers unevenly, potentially increasing inequality. At the same time, new demographic challenges driven by aging will have large impacts on labor. How will these forces affect the future of labor and how should we prepare for changes in the labor market? The goal of this course is to provide students with a framework for analyzing how new technologies like robotics and AI will affect the labor market drawing largely from the economics literature. Students will analyze and describe the literature on these topics and understand the different methodologies used in the literature. Ultimately, students will build perspectives on how AI and robotics could affect jobs, occupations, the future of work, income distribution and social institutions. Students will also build perspectives on education, training, and redistribution policies that can help mitigate the labor market disruptions created by technological change. Students will collect and analyze data that can provide insights on the future of labor.
KSGA 40495	This five-week course will examine forced migration from the perspective of the beliefs, teachings, and programmatic commitments of faith communities. The first week will be devoted to identifying the causes of and global trends in forced migration, as well as the categories of forced migrants. It will also explore the “law of migration”; that is, the diverse legal systems that migrants must negotiate on their journeys and that religious actors use to assess migration policies. The second week will explore the teachings of diverse faith communities on forced migration, their understanding of this immense and growing phenomenon, and their programmatic and policy responses. The third week will segue to state-centered approaches to the governance and management of migration, with a focus on the concepts of sovereignty and the rule of law. It will also consider ideologies such as nativism and exclusionary nationalism that are in tension with the beliefs, policy positions, and programs of religious actors. The fourth week will be devoted to guest speakers and student presentation on situations of protracted displacement throughout the world. Persons in protracted displacement have lived in exile for at least five years and have no viable course out of their “long lasting and intractable status of limbo.” The fifth week will be devoted to US refugee protection trends and policies.

It provides a foundation of the basic intellectual property concepts upon which IT activities and transactions are based; the transactions, such as the licensing of software or information resources, the outsourcing or hosting of services or information, development of software or websites (along with the allocation of associated rights); and the challenges posed by e-commerce.  It also addresses existing and pending laws and regulations impacting the use of IT systems, including electronic privacy and security mandates, commercial law related to IT, and the use of electronic signatures.  The course examines potential liabilities based on the operation of IT systems, including Internet-based problems (e.g. hacking, denial of service, cyber-torts), domain name/trademark issues, and intellectual property concerns, including the impact of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.   The course also addresses the attorney's and client's responsibilities in potential or actual litigation with respect to electronic discovery and handling of electronic evidence.
LAW 70136	Course takes a cross-sectional approach to the legal protection available for various types of design, such as industrial design and architectural design.  The course differs from traditional intellectual property courses in that it approaches the legal system from a subject matter perspective rather than a particular doctrinal perspective.  That is, rather than focusing on trademark law or copyright law in particular and then asking how the doctrine applies to various works, this course starts with the type of work at issue - say, the design of conveyor belt guard rails - and asks what legal protection might be available for the design, looking across doctrinal areas.  This is, in many respects, a more realistic portrayal of legal practice:  clients, unless they are quite sophisticated, rarely come to lawyers with an issue that announces itself as a &quot;trademark&quot; or a &quot;copyright&quot; issue.  Instead, clients come to lawyers with a new product or with a product they would like to develop, and they ask the lawyer to identify the legal issues.  Because design implicates a number of legal regimes, looking at design protection through any particular doctrinal area in isolation is an incomplete picture.
LAW 70137	This course will provide an in-depth treatment of trademark and unfair competition law, including protection of trademarks and trade dress, federal registration of trademarks, trademark and trade dress infringement, trademark dilution, misappropriation and unfair competition, and the right of publicity.

LAW 70204	Applied Evidence - Pretrial Analysis for Civil Disputes uses the problem method and Federal Rules of Evidence to analyze evidence concepts/principles during pretrial from when a client is retained through settlement or trial / arbitration / mediation. Applied Evidence Pretrial Analysis course is designed to provide new lawyers with the analytical skills to provide valued advice on pretrial evidence matters in response to a request from a senior lawyer. Each pretrial evidence request requires analysis of how to develop facts to satisfy evidentiary foundation requirements, or defeat foundation requirements. Knowledge of evidentiary foundation requirements is necessary to provide competent advice. Also such evidentiary analysis and advice informs the need for discovery of facts to support or defeat foundation requirements. New lawyers need to add value to their employers - this course is designed to provide those tools. Semester workshops analyze evidence problems a new lawyer will face in practice - receive a memo from a senior associate or partner to analyze facts on a client matter and report back in writing with (1) an analysis of the evidentiary matters and (2) a plan of action.  Two papers during semester on topics covered in class. Take Home Final on the evidentiary matters covered during the last few weeks of the semester.

LAW 70304	The Freedom of Religion is widely regarded as a fundamental human right and as Americans' &quot;first freedom.&quot; But what, exactly, are the content, implications, and foundations of this freedom? This course examines the precedents and doctrines relating to the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, the history and purposes of these provisions, and the theoretical foundations of the freedom they protect. The approaches taken to religious-freedom questions in other legal regimes will also be considered. Topics include public funding for religious education, religious expression and activity in public spaces, exemptions from generally applicable laws for religious believers and religiously motivated conduct, the extent to which state action and laws may reflect religious purposes and values, the autonomy and independence of religious institutions, and the ability of government to protect and promote religious freedom as a human good.

Questions to be considered include:  How, and why, do we define and protect the Freedom of Speech?  What are the benefits, and what are the costs, of free speech?  When is the regulation or censorship of expression justified?  Are courts and legislators ever justified in assigning greater value to some messages and forms of expression than to others, or in silencing some speakers in order to amplify the voice of others?  Does the government have a role to play in creating the conditions necessary for the freedom of speech to flourish, or is the freedom of speech best considered as a constraint on government?  Is the freedom of speech primarily an individual right or a structural feature of constitutional government?
LAW 70311	Focuses on the federalism issues created by the existence of dual state- and federal-court systems.

LAW 70318	This course seeks to provide the understanding of the legislative and administrative process that is needed to practice law in the United States in the twenty-first century. It is based on a course that students are required to take in their first year at the Harvard Law School in order &quot;to bring the first-year law school curriculum more in line with the realities of modern legal practice and the structure of our legal system - in particular, the centrality of statutes and regulations,&quot; and &quot;to teach students how judges and administrative interpreters construe these legal materials.&quot; The course includes three sections: (1) an initial overview of the law of the lawmaking process; (2) an introduction to statutory interpretation; and (3) an analysis of the regulatory process. It also includes several skills components requiring the drafting of a proposed statute and commenting on proposed administrative regulations. The course thus provides a foundation for the numerous classes that study specific statutory and regulatory schemes. There is no prerequisite for the course. Students who have already taken either Statutory Interpretation or Administrative Law may not take Legislation &amp; Regulation.

LAW 70398	What are Beijing's objectives towards the developing world and how have they have evolved and been pursued over time? In light of China's unprecedented Belt and Road Initiative and increasingly assertive military activities far from its shores, the answer to this question is perhaps more important than ever before. This course analyzes and explains China's strategies in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Latin America, and evaluates their effectiveness. It is informed by the functionally organized academic literature, but uses a regional approach that allows for comparisons among regions based on their economic, political, military, and social characteristics. Topics will cut across the overlapping political, economic and security spheres, with particular attention paid to how different developing countries have perceived and responded to China's rapidly growing engagement and influence. This structure allows us to consider not only the unique features of Chinese engagement in each region, but also place them in the larger context of Beijing's strategy towards other developing regions and the developing world as a whole. This course will be of great interest to students and scholars interested in international development, Chinese foreign policy, comparative political economy, and international relations.
LAW 70401	We live in an ever-shrinking world in which social, cultural, and economic life is global. People everywhere are aware of the suffering in Syria and the impact of climate change. They want to be part of how cyber space and outer space are regulated. People want to maintain national identity and security, while being able to travel, trade, and connect everywhere. International law is the one means available to all to peacefully achieve a common vision of a better future. It is a system of rules, principles and procedures that regulate activity at the inter-state level.

LAW 70807	Takes an in-depth view of certain ethical issues in the legal profession. Among the issues discussed are: confidentiality, conflict of interests, unpopular clients, lawyers' speech and advertising, admission to and regulation of the bar, and responsibilities to some special clients. The course examines the &lt;i&gt;ABA Model Rules&lt;/i&gt; and relevant cases. In an attempt to uncover the foundation that might be claimed to underpin the rules, a spectrum of philosophical, theological, pragmatic and utilitarian theories are considered. The course thus deals with the application of the rules of professional responsibility to real ethical conflicts and critically examines the possibilities of the moral values reflected in the law. Note: This course DOES satisfy the Ethics II requirement for graduation.
LAW 70812	Are law students preparing to participate in the tradition of a noble profession or merely training to be skilled manipulators of language, concepts, and other people?  This course will inquire about the philosophy of law; the nature and possible distinctiveness of legal reasoning; the purpose of law and lawyering in society; and the perplexity of many contemporary students, scholars, and practicing lawyers in the face of such questions.   To pursue these questions, this course will draw on writings in jurisprudence and the history of ideas ranging from Plato to postmodernism, as well as judicial opinions that turn abstract ideas into legal action.  This course aspires to give students the opportunity to ensure that their legal lives do not go unexamined.
LAW 70832	That is why a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, and the two of them become one body (Gen 2:24). For millennia, these words have been indicative of a common understanding of the nature of marriage. While this scriptural description no longer underlies the civil understanding of marriage in many jurisdictions, it still provides a rich foundation for the Catholic Church's teachings on the sacrament of Matrimony. In addition to its theology of this unique union, the Church also has a rich legal tradition.    The course will expound that legal tradition, beginning with its biblical origins and concluding with most recent developments of the law introduced  in the motu proprio Mitis Iudex (2015). The course will use the law found in the Code of Canons (CIC-83) and the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO) as its base text. The study of the law will be informed with a historical survey of other legal sources, especially those found in Roman law, and those from expositors of the natural law.      By the end of the class you will have acquired a significant knowledge of the development of law in the Catholic Church, from the first century to the most recent legislation.
LAW 70835	Over the last century and a half, the Catholic tradition has developed a body of thought that responds to a variety of political, legal, and social questions presented by the modern world. During this period, the Church has concerned itself with questions of individualism, totalitarianism, statism, legal positivism, human rights, and social justice. The seminar will consist of the reading and discussion of major documents in that tradition and of representative figures such as John Courtney Murray, SJ and Jacques Maritain. Topics explored through these readings will include the common good, the nature of the state, the state's relationship to society, the relationship of the state to the Catholic Church and to other churches, social justice and charity, pluralism, subsidiarity, authority, natural law, and natural rights.
LAW 70837	On June 1, 2021, Pope Francis issued a new Apostolic Constitution, entitled Pascxite gregem Dei, with which he completely modified the penal code (Liber VI) of the Latin Church. Pascite gregem Dei marks a dramatic shift in the penal law of the 1983 code, introducing not only new crimes, but a new vocabulary and a modified vision of penal law. By choosing the title Pascite gregem Dei (Tend the flock of God), Pope Francis restored a place in the pastoral life of the Church to penal law, which has been the object of neglect for decades. Combining the lessons learned from the perennial fight against the sexual misconduct of clerics, particularly with minors, Pope Francis presents a new vision of penal law as a pastoral tool, bridging the divide in the minds of many between &quot;pastoral&quot; and &quot;legalistic&quot; approaches to misconduct in the Church. The prime mover of the reform of penal law in the 21 st century has been the crime of sexual abuse of minors. An examination of the development of law addressing this crime, and other delicta graviora (the most serious category of crimes in the Church), will serve as a lens through which other reforms of penal law will be examined. This course will explore the development of penal law in the Catholic Church, focusing on the modifications introduced in the 21 st century. Beginning with Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela issued by Saint Pope John Paul II on April 30, 2001, the course will examine each piece of legislation that has introduced modifications to the penal law of the Church. The course will also examine some important changes to procedural law that have been introduce in tandem with modifications to penal law. By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of the penal code of the Catholic Church and the basic legal instruments and procedures used in its application.
LAW 70838	This is a course about constitutional development from the founding of the first colonies in British North America to the American Civil War. The topics considered will include  constitutional understandings and practices in 17th and 18th Century Great Britain and her North American colonies;  the role that differing constitutional understandings and practices played in the precipitation of the American Revolution; the constitutional arrangements that emerged in and among the states during and in the immediate wake of the Revolution, and the role that perceived shortcomings in those arrangements played in the decision to formulate a new Constitution of the United States; the manner in which participants in the framing and ratification of the Constitution sought to redress the deficiencies of preceding institutional arrangements; constitutional issues arising in the Early National Period; the nullification crisis of 1832-1833; the constitutional controversies presented by the existence of chattel slavery in a federal union; and the manner in which differing understandings of state and federal power under the Constitution contributed to secession and Civil War. Students will be evaluated based on class participation and a two-hour, closed book final examination.
LAW 70908	The Intercollegiate Externship will provide an opportunity for law students to gain practical experience and academic credit in intercollegiate athletics administration through a classroom component taught by Law School faculty and senior-level administrator-attorneys from Athletics and via non-classroom externship work.

LAW 73108	On August 2001, a senior executive at Enron, a natural gas trading company, sent an anonymous letter to the company's CEO warning him about the company's accounting practices, foretelling the downfall of the company and the end of its public auditor. Nineteen years later, in August 2020, the CEO of Theranos, a company that claimed to have reinvented blood testing, is scheduled to go to trial on charges that she and the company's COO engaged in a scheme that defrauded investors of hundreds of millions of dollars. Both Enron and Theranos had well-regarded Board of Directors and were advised by leading external auditors and lawyers, yet both were alleged to have orchestrated widespread financial fraud. Using Enron and Theranos as bookends, this course will examine the role that attorney-led Internal Investigations have occupied over the past twenty years as a tool utilized by organizations to respond to allegations of misconduct. Informed by close examination of real-life internal investigations, this course will address three core questions: (1) when should an organization conduct an internal investigation; (2) what are the best practices for conducting such investigations; and (3) how should an organization share the results of such an investigation. In considering these three core questions, we will wrestle with practical, theoretical and ethical issues that make the practice of internal investigations one of the most interesting, and challenging, areas of law for private practice and government attorneys. The class will conclude with a case study of the Theranos matter and will afford you the opportunity to apply lessons learned to imagine how you would have handled that matter.
LAW 73129	This is a course in applied contract theory. It introduces topics in the theory and practice of contract and asks students to apply the insights from those fields to an actual contracting problem. In the first part of the course, we will read scholarship studying contract from the perspectives of law and economics, law and economic sociology, and empirical legal studies. In the second part of the course, each student will present work on a contract design challenge the student has identified (in consultation with the instructor) in a selected industry or transaction type. Each student must submit a paper of approximately 7,000 words on the design challenge and present work in progress to the class on an assigned day during the last five or so class meetings. Students may, with permission of the instructor, choose to write a 10,000 word paper that satisfies the Upper-Level Writing Requirement for 3 credits.     Every student is expected to actively participate in class sessions. Each student will be assigned to serve as discussion leader for one class meeting. Depending on course enrollment, there might be joint discussion leaders for some sessions. The discussion leader or leaders will each submit five questions to the course instructor at least 48 hours before class, revise those questions in consultation with the instructor, and then lead the class in discussion of those questions. Students will also present their work in progress on a contract design challenge to the class and lead a class discussion of the problem. 
LAW 73134	This course examines the unique aspects of internet/computer or &quot;cyber&quot; crime.  It surveys federal statutes pertaining to computer and internet related crimes and their application, sentencing issues, and first amendment and fourth amendment issues that arise in this context.  The instructor will also cover practical aspects of computer crime investigation and prosecution and current computer forensic examination capabilities throughout the course.
LAW 73145	This seminar provides an introduction to economic analysis of law and a forum for investigating current research in law and economics, law and business, and law and the social sciences.  The seminar consists of (i) guided discussions on topics within law and economics, and (ii) workshop presentations in which speakers, from Notre Dame and other universities, deliver papers and students have an opportunity to ask questions and offer their comments.  Students are expected to participate actively in class discussions and workshops and submit in-depth response papers (1,200-1,500 words) on the workshop papers.  A final paper is optional.  Students with an interest in or prior studies pertaining to economics, business, or the social sciences may find the seminar especially appealing, but neither a background in these subjects nor knowledge of technical economics is necessary for enrolling or succeeding in the course.
LAW 73311	Judging entails the evaluation of proof and reasoned argument by litigants. In this seminar students consider the judicial role in the common law, statutory interpretation, administrative practice, and constitutional adjudication. The class examines the judicial role, trial and appellate, including judicial accountability and judicial independence. Students explore judicial decision-making so once admitted to practice they can better advocate to the bench and advise clients. They will read a variety of legal texts and discuss how courts interact with  litigants, the other branches of government, the public, and other courts. Requires a series of short papers in response to questions posed by the instructor.
LAW 73312	This course examines advanced topics concerning the role of the federal courts in the operation of the United States federal system. One of the main goals of the course is to help students prepare for judicial clerkships in the United States District Court and Court of Appeals. Accordingly, the course will examine a range of advanced topics in the theory and practice of federal courts that have special importance to judicial clerkships. A particular focus of the course will be upon the sources of law that federal courts apply and how they apply them.     Professor permission is needed to register.
LAW 73320	Focuses primarily on the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, (CEDAW), and the Optional Protocol to the Convention.  Students will explore the status of CEDAW as an international treaty, and familiarize themselves with the kinds of reservations that signatories to CEDAW have entered. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action will also be briefly covered, as will other international instruments such as the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.
LAW 73361	This seminar will take a broad look at how policing and race interact.  We will read selections from books, articles or speeches of people such as Michelle Alexander, Paul Butler, Ta-Nehisi Coates, James Comey, Alice Goffman, Jill Leovy, Tracey Meares, Jonathan Pfaff, Stephen Rushin, and William Stuntz.  We will also read some primary materials and research on the DOJ's investigation of Ferguson, stop and frisk policies, and structural reform litigation.  Students will be required to write a short reaction paper for the week's reading, due before class and published on the course website for fellow students to read.  Grading will depend heavily on active participation in discussion.  This is a two credit class.

LAW 73375	The course seeks to introduce students to the contributions of the Christian tradition to the rule of law, to conceptions of criminal and civil justice, and to the development and understanding of human rights.
LAW 73376	This course explores topics of the conflict of laws from a comparative perspective. There are three distinct areas to this course: (i) jurisdiction, (ii) recognition and enforcement of judgments, and (iii) choice of law. The course thus follows the common law approach and combines questions of choice of law and international civil procedure. It is comparative as we will be comparing the approaches chosen in several countries, mainly the common law as represented by the US (with some references to UK, Canada and Australia) and the civil law represented by harmonized European law.
LAW 73403	Studies the anti-bribery Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) from the standpoint of a practitioner advising a U.S. client engaging in a business opportunity overseas.  Topics to be addressed include:  the FCPA's legislative history; the current state, and possible future trends, of FCPA enforcement by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission; compliance, due diligence, and mitigation strategies; and other laws that might be relevant to U.S. clients operating overseas such as the UK Bribery Act, the Travel Act, and anti-money laundering, fraud, and commercial bribery laws.  Grading for the class will be based on class participation and on the writing and presentation of a research paper that may, with prior approval, be used to satisfy the Upper Level Writing Requirement.    There are no pre or co-requisites for this course, other than the basic required course in Criminal Law.  The class is a two credit class and will meet once a week, in 100 minute sessions.

LAW 73405	Crosslist with MGTO 70305 Objectives of the course: 1) Increase the overall awareness of how business can be a force for good in society, particularly in war-torn areas 2) Introduce basic concepts in developmental economics and peace through commerce 3) Delve more deeply into the specific political, cultural, economic, and business challenges of a specific war-torn country 4) Investigate, based on field visit, both the activities of local and/or international businesses in a war-torn region and the positive/negative impact of those business activities.  End products of the course: 1) Detailed case study of the positive/negative impact of the activities of local and international businesses in a war-torn region to be published 2) Perhaps an increased commitment, and certainly a better understanding, on the part of students of the possible impact that business can have in the most difficult of circumstances.
LAW 73407	"Crosslist with MBA 70437  On July 28, 2022 the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) declared that living in a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is a human right (UN <a href=""/search/?p=GA%202022"" data-action=""result-detail"" data-group=""code:GA 2022""  class=""notoffered"">GA 2022</a>). Similarly, founded on the basic principles of protect, respect, and remedy, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights set standards for states and corporations, whether domestic or international, for maintaining and promoting human rights (UN OHCHR 2021). Taken together, these declarations and standards imply that businesses complying with them must account for the excess environmental risk and hazard produced by their operations as well as their potential contribution to environmental violence. While many tend to juxtapose these goals as antithetical to one another, given the historical outsized effect of business in producing environmental hazards, in fact enterprise is the key mode for regeneration. In this course, which will center on skills-training and state-of-the-art learning on regenerative enterprise development, students will apply sustainable business praxis through service learning with partnering international organizations. Students—who are our future enterprise, policy, law, science and engineering leaders—will co-create regenerative livelihoods through collaborative planning with their partners and the communities most impacted by environmental hazards and other social ills degrading livelihood options. Working hand-in-hand with partners digitally all semester and in-person during Spring Break, students will experience firsthand the power of enterprise to regenerate a sustainable future for people suffering these intersecting challenges the most, while learning critical skills that are increasingly in demand (e.g., ESG consulting is the fastest growing area in consultancy today), preparing them to craft and employ enterprise as a ‘noble vocation’ towards integral human development and flourishing."
LAW 73426	This seminar will focus on world of plea bargaining that has become the reality of criminal justice in modern America. The criminal trial is a rarity; in some jurisdictions, it is practically nonexistent.  The course will begin with a brief discussion of some of the historical pressures that led to the widespread use of plea bargaining in America today.  The introductory discussion also will cover the mechanics of the plea bargaining process.   We then will discuss plea bargaining's perceived advantages and disadvantages: whether, on the one hand, it unduly sacrifices procedural fairness and protections for the good of efficiency; or, on the other hand, whether it facilitates compromise and rehabilitation in lieu of costly adversarial combat.    We will bear in mind the distinct roles of the prosecutor, defense attorney, and judge in the plea bargaining process, and any constraints that constitutional law may impose on plea bargains.   We will examine in detail the issue of coercion in the plea bargaining context. The class will explore numerous ethical issues, such as those involved in the use of cooperating defendants, defendants who want plea deals but who assert innocence, and plea agreements that impose novel punishments not contemplated by statutory law.  We will ask whether plea bargaining is a proper means to ameliorate criminal punishment where legislatures lack the political will or capacity to ameliorate criminal statutes, and whether there is a role for mercy in the plea bargaining process. Relatedly, we will evaluate whether greater public participation and transparency are needed for plea bargaining to serve as a democratically legitimate process for resolving criminal cases.
LAW 73510	Governments and organizations around the world increasingly turn to behaviorally-informed regulation in policy domains ranging from health, safety, education, and finance to environmental protection, tax compliance, public service delivery, and more. In all of these areas, regulators aim to promote social welfare by shaping the behavior of the people they target, drawing on the evidence and methods of behavioral science to justify and inform the design of both traditional regulatory instruments (e.g., taxes, subsidies, or mandates) and novel, psychology-based tools or “nudges” (such as simplifying information, setting default arrangements, or employing social norms). Despite their promise and appeal to policymakers, however, behaviorally-informed regulation generally and nudging in particular are hotly debated, with some scholars challenging their legitimacy, desirability, or efficacy. Using legal, economic, and behavioral sources, the seminar will explore the contours of behavioral regulation, its foundations, promise and limitation, benefits and costs. Our goal is to develop an informed, critical understanding of this ascendant form of regulation while providing students an opportunity to write a substantial research paper on a topic of their choice within the broad field of behaviorally-informed policymaking.
LAW 73828	This course will explore the ethical, legal, and public policy issues arising from various advances in biomedical science and biotechnology. Students will be invited to consider the ways in which such developments affect law and public policy, as well as the issues that may arise in attempts to govern and regulate science according to ethical principles. Topics covered will include: human reproduction (including maternal/fetal conflicts and assisted reproduction), stem cell research, human cloning, genetic screening and modification, research involving human subjects, neuroscience/neuroethics, end of life matters, and relevant issues touching and concerning both intellectual property and constitutional law. No prior experience with science, medicine, philosophy, or related disciplines is assumed or necessary.  Law and Bioethics is designed as a two-credit course. Students' final grades will be based on classroom participation and a research paper.
LAW 73830	This seminar will examine constitutional issues in the context of the military justice system.  To that end, you will become familiar with both the constitutional and statutory framework underlying these issues as well as caselaw from federal courts that have analyzed these issues.  Over the course of the week, we will examine issues related to serving as an Article I court within the federal system, particularly jurisdiction.  We will also delve into areas of constitutional law that you are already familiar with, including aspects of criminal procedure, Due Process, and First Amendment jurisprudence, albeit in the military context.  Finally, while a military background is not necessary to fully engage with the course material, we will examine some issues unique to the military justice system.  The goal of this seminar is to improve your understanding of constitutional issues and help you develop an organized framework for approaching legal problems from the perspective of an appellate court.  As such, each topic will begin with the text of the underlying constitutional provision, followed by the text of the relevant statute, and finally the body of caselaw that arises out of the judicial system.  From time to time, we will also read scholarly articles and advocacy documents that will help put all these issues into context.
LAW 73832	Survey of Federal District Court Practice and Writing is designed to immerse the student into the life of a federal district court. The goal is to prepare students with district court clerkships for the writing and researching that they will be doing in chambers. To that end, students will be exposed to both civil and criminal topics that they will see in the district courts. Students will employ their research skills to find jurisdiction-specific law in an efficient manner. Finally, and most importantly, students will practice writing and editing the nondispositive and dispositive orders that they will be drafting during their clerkships. Ideally, all federal clerks will take Federal Courts prior to their clerkships. Nevertheless, Federal Courts is not a prerequisite for this course. Although the course is designed for clerks, it also is open to aspiring federal district court clerks with instructor permission.
LAW 73833	This course provides a targeted legal writing curriculum to help students master foundational legal writing skills. Applied Legal Writing (“ALW”) will build upon the lawyering skills taught in first-year legal writing, with an emphasis on skills that prove the most difficult for students to master. Targeting tasks that are commonly asked of summer and junior associates, ALW will require regular communication, accurate analysis, and prompt turnaround. The semester will include objective and persuasive writing, providing extensive opportunities for individual feedback. We will move through the skills that the practicing bar expects students to learn in law school to catch the skills that the students are missing and then teach those skills.
LAW 73906	This course focuses on the response of the legal system to the particular problems of the sports industry. The course will cover contractual obligations in professional sports, antitrust aspects of professional sports, regulation of agents, sports violence, labor relations and collective bargaining in professional sports, arbitration, the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the regulation of intercollegiate sports, the regulation of amateur sports, and gender equity in athletics.
LAW 75111	This course is designed to introduce students to the basic transactional law skill sets required and expected of junior associates practicing in the field of corporate, private equity and/or real estate law. The course will emphasize practical knowledge and skills, through a simulated joint venture negotiation between typical joint venture partners in a real estate asset purchase (i.e., a &quot;money partner&quot; and a &quot;property manager&quot;) to provide future transactional law students a basic understanding of (1) the transactional deal process, (2) the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, (3) basic corporate drafting skills and (4) the business issues associated with a joint venture agreement.  These skills will be reinforced through the (1) negotiation and drafting of  a Limited Liability Company Agreement, addressing all major (non-tax) business issues, for a proposed Delaware limited liability company, (2) drafting of corporate authority (and related) documents, (3) client counseling on major business concerns and (4) review of the Delaware limited liability company act for statutory framework governing the Limited Liability Companies generally.  Students teams will each have a &quot;client&quot; who will be a practicing attorney.  The &quot;client&quot; will serve to present various business issues and to provide feedback on agreements being drafted by each team. This class will be of interest to students who intend to practice as transactional attorneys. By the end of the course the students will be introduced to document drafting basic skills and be able to identify high level business issues associated with a typical joint venture. Course prerequisites Students must have taken Contracts and Business Associations.  Federal Income Taxation is encouraged but not required.  Prior experience in the field of transactional law or equivalent experience in the business arena would be beneficial but also is not required.
LAW 75611	The Religious Liberty Clinic II provides students real-world lawyering experience through participation in cutting-edge religious liberty matters.  The Clinic represents a diverse group of individuals and organizations in a variety of legal disputes that implicate the right to religious exercise, expression, and association for people of all faiths.  Working in groups under the supervision of experienced attorneys, students will have the opportunity to develop skills in identifying and investigating new matters, building relationships with clients, developing case strategy, conducting legal research, and drafting briefs or other court filings.

LAW 75709	Trial Ad Comprehensive is a semester-long course designed to introduce second- and third-year law students to basic trial advocacy skills.  The class is taught by adjunct faculty that have extensive civil, criminal, and judicial experience.  Guest lecturers and witnesses are used at times to enhance certain demonstrations of basic skills.  Although not an evidence course, classes expose students to basic rules of evidence used by litigators in the courtroom.  One class session is devoted to current trends in the digital age including e-discovery and digital software for trial presentations.  CTA endeavors to provide a wide variety of experience and feedback to allow students to develop their own style as an advocate.  In addition to the adjunct faculty rotating among the sections during the semester, the class culminates in the execution of a bench trial and a simulated jury trial at the St. Joseph County courthouse.  Students will get the opportunity to present their case (from picking a jury, to questioning witnesses, and giving final arguments) in an actual courtroom.  Instructors simulate the &quot;real life&quot; experience for students by inviting guest attorneys and judges from various jurisdictions to preside over the trial, as well as provide constructive advice and networking opportunities for the students.  Students attend two sessions per week.  One weekly session is devoted to instructors lecturing and showing students a basic skill such as openings, direct examinations and closing arguments. Performance sessions are conducted in a separate session, where students will have an opportunity to practice the various skills, and receive constructive feedback from instructors. Students who want a career in litigation or are unsure of their interest in such a career have found the course to be practical and rewarding and even fun at times. Readings for the class are assigned from two text books, and electronically posted articles.  The texts include a case study file that forms the basis of a jury trial at the end of the semester, and a trial advocacy text as a resource to provide additional context and understanding of general principles discussed by instructors.  The course is not graded so the emphasis remains on skill building throughout the semester.
LAW 75710	This course starts the week before the semester begins. The class meets from 9:00 am until 6:30 p.m. each of the eight days of the intensive week. Students learn trial skills, which they will apply in two trials. This course is designed for students whose primary career interest is litigation but all students will benefit from the course regardless of the area of law they intend to practice. It is intended to help students develop a familiarity with the techniques by which evidence of controverted facts is presented at trial before judges and juries. Classroom sessions in conjunction with a judge and jury trial for each student provide an examination and analysis of trial advocacy skills and issues of professional responsibility. The course involves workshop sessions and learning-by-doing through simulated courtroom exercises. Students study trial advocacy techniques through student participation, faculty critique, lectures, and demonstrations by practicing lawyers. The various trial advocacy skills are put together in two full trials, one to a judge and one to a jury.
LAW 75715	Studies the skills, techniques, tactics, strategies and ethical considerations of witness preparation for depositions and the taking and defending of depositions under federal and state rules of civil procedure.

LLEA 20300	What does it mean to be Korean? How are definitions of Korea and “Koreanness” affected by recent waves of globalization and migration? This course investigates the social construction of race and nationhood within the context of South Korea. While many believe South Korea to be ethnically and racially homogeneous, the country has increasingly opened up its borders to foreign migration to offset the adverse impact of its rapidly aging society. More than one in ten marriages in South Korea involves a foreign-born person today, and growing numbers of racially mixed people consider themselves Korean. In addition, members of the Korean diaspora have started to “return” to their country of origin in recent years, only to find that they are marginalized because of their culturally different backgrounds. This course introduces students to sociological theories of race, ethnicity, and nationhood by analyzing how South Koreans define self and Other. We will learn how racial and ethnic identities continue to evolve as the contexts of migration change. We will also learn why it is difficult for individuals of particular backgrounds to find a sense of belonging in the societies in which they live and work.
LLEA 30001	An overview of the principles of language structure, the processes of first and second language acquisition, and the issues involved in assessing language proficiency with special attention paid to the application of linguistic knowledge to the multilingual and multicultural school setting.
LLEA 30002	Many people predict that the 21st century will be the &quot;Asian Century,&quot; dominated by China, India, and other nation-states on the continent. What does it mean to imagine an Asian future? In this class, we answer this question by rethinking connections between past, present, and future, both within and between different nations in Asia. How can we better understand the global connections between past and present if we take Asia, rather than Europe and North America, as our starting point? By contextualizing contemporary issues in Asia within global social and historical context, students will learn to move beyond common stereotypes about the region. We will use materials from history, anthropology, religion, and literature to explore the impacts of colonialism, nationalism, and globalization on everyday life across the continent. Through this course, students will learn how to analyze the intersections of personal, local, regional, and global contexts in order to better explain how Asia shapes our world. All majors and backgrounds are welcome. No prior knowledge about Asian languages or topics is required.
LLEA 30101	This course is on the religion, philosophy, and intellectual history of China and introduces the student to the worldview and life experience of Chinese as they have been drawn from local traditions, as well as worship and sacrifice to heroes and the cult of the dead. Through a close reading of primary texts in translation, it also surveys China’s grand philosophical legacy of Daoism, Buddhism, “Confucianism,” and “Neo-Confucianism.”
LLEA 30315	The English word “love” encompasses a variety of meanings: love of one’s family, love of one’s country, love for a friend, even God’s love, but the subject of much Western poetry and popular songs for centuries, to say nothing of countless stories, is erotic love—our desire to possess another, to become one with another. In Japan’s classical literature, erotic love is often seen as a kind of “demonic” or spiritual possession, an out-of-body passion so powerful that it transcends even death. In this course we will explore how this view of love compares to our own views, as depicted in Japanese fiction, poetry, and drama. If our view of love has been largely shaped by our Judeo-Christian tradition, the various images of love we find in Japanese literature were shaped by a quite different tradition: the indigenous religion of Shinto (‘the way of the gods’), and Buddhism and Confucianism imported from China. How different are these views from our own? If we believe that erotic love is a universal human attribute, how and why does culture, ours or any other, rein in such basic human impulses and to what end?
LLEA 30340	This course provides an introduction to Korean culture and history through contemporary Korean films. Exploring Korean culture and history through films is recognized as an effective method which helps students understand the past events and interpret embedded messages from the periods as well as explore cinematic representations of past events. This course will guide students to an extensive understanding of modern and contemporary Korean history and thematic issues, including colonization by Japan and Korean nationalism until 1945, the division of the Korean peninsula and Korean War in the 1950s, rapid industrialization in the 1960s to 1980s, democracy and human rights in the 1980s to 1990s, social issues in the 2000s such as Korean diaspora, multiculturalism, inter-Korean confrontation and reconciliation, feminism, familism, cultural hybridity, Korean capitalism and social class. No prior acquaintance with the Korean language and history is required.
LLEA 33000	In this special course designed for inquisitive international economics / Chinese and Japanese majors, students will attend a number of lectures, panels, and seminars on campus during the semester, with a follow-up discussion for each led by either a visitor or a member of the economics or romance languages faculty. Before each session, students will be expected to complete a short reading assignment. At each follow-up session, the students will submit a 1-2 page summary and analysis of the talk, with a critical question for discussion. The goal is to encourage students to enrich their major experience by participating in the intellectual discussions that occur amongst ND and visiting scholars across the campus, distinguished alumni, and professionals in the field.
LLEA 33320	This course will introduce students to modern Japanese literature, starting from the emergence of the shōsetsu and discourses surrounding it through the postwar era. We will look at changes in the conception of literary texts and readership, and their relationship to changes in Japanese society and the construction of the image of &quot;Japan&quot; during this period. Readings will cover canonical authors from the late Meiji Period through the 1960s such as Mori Ōgai, Natsume Sōseki, Tanizaki Jun'ichirō, Kawabata Yasunari, Hayashi Fumiko, Mishima Yukio, and Ōe Kenzaburō; they will also include key works of Gothic literature, proletarian literature, and colonial literature. We will focus on close textual analysis within this specific cultural and historical context, the politics of canonization, and the role of literature in constructing the ideas of modernity and nationhood in modern Japan.
LLEA 33848	This course encourages students to read and discuss English translations of key modern Chinese literary texts, selected from among those that have delighted western audiences (such as the Nobel Prize winners Gao Xingjian and Mo Yan) as well as those that have been considered of huge significance by Chinese communities at different times. Most of the readings will be short stories and (parts of) novels, but due attention will be paid also to poetry and the prose essay, both incredibly important genres in the Chinese context. Students will be provided with a key vocabulary to discuss the texts, including both western and Chinese critical terminology, and with a range of interpretative methods. They will also be expected to carry out background reading, including academic studies of the literary works under scrutiny, and general works introducing the relevant historical contexts. At the end of the semester, students will have gained a good knowledge of the modern Chinese literary canon and will have gained critical ability in analyzing modern Chinese literary works from a range of perspectives.
LLEA 40130	Asian theatre- and film-makers have produced some of the most innovative and exciting versions of Shakespeare's work. His strong presence in Asia also speaks to the histories and legacies of colonization and cultural imperialism. This course explores several well-known Shakespearean plays through the lens of Asian adaptation, rooted in both close reading of the plays themselves and the historical-cultural contexts of their adaptations. How, when, and why have specific Shakespearean plays captured the imaginations of Asian theatre artists and filmmakers? How have they transformed Shakespearean texts through translation, the use of local performance forms, new geographic and historical settings, and other techniques? How do these reimaginings rethink what &quot;Shakespeare&quot; might mean? By exploring such questions, students will gain a deeper understanding of Shakespeare, Asian theatre, and the complexities of their conjoining.
LLEA 40413	This course is an introduction to the Chinese sound and writing system, morphology, and syntax of the modern standard forms from a historical and linguistic perspective. The purpose of this course is to lead students who have the limited or no knowledge of Chinese to explore some interesting language phenomena by comparing Chinese and English, and to familiarize students with fundamental and systematical knowledge of the modern Chinese word formation and sentence structures.
LLEA 40663	What is race? How do concepts of race change according to social, political, and historical context? Do Asian understandings of race differ from those in the West? How are concepts like &quot;blackness&quot; and &quot;white privilege&quot; interpreted in Asia? In this class, we will grapple with this set of questions by looking at how competing definitions of race and nationhood emerged in conjunction with the rise of the Japanese empire (1910-1945), and American military occupation in Asia during the Cold War. Students will investigate how this historical context has continued to affect the ways more contemporary flows of migrants from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa are racialized in Asia, by analyzing sociological, anthropological, and historical texts of everyday life. No prior knowledge about Asian languages or topics is required.
LLEA 58312	Majors in Chinese are strongly encouraged to pursue the honors track. Those who are interested must meet the following criteria: 1) Fulfillment of all the requirements for a first major of 30 credit hours in Chinese; 2) A cumulative GPA of at least 3.6 or permission from the Department Chair. Program requirements: In addition to the 30 hours required for a major, the honors track requires the completion of a senior honors thesis of at least 30 pages that demonstrates the student's originality and ability to do research in the target field. For this endeavor the student will receive 3 hours of graded credit. This means that to graduate with departmental honors, the student must earn 33 hours of credit in the major. Based on past experience, it is our expectation that honors projects will emerge from previous course work where close interaction between faculty and students has planted the seeds for a larger project; from the student's leadership role in the cultural and intellectual life of the department; or as a follow up to experiences begun during his/her study abroad program. A thesis director is chosen to guide the student and provide assistance.
LLRO 10118	Creole is spoken by an estimated seventeen million people.

LLRO 20650	In the intricate and interconnected society of the Late Middle Ages in the Mediterranean Basin (12th-15th Centuries), the short story emerged as a dominant literary genre, transcending cultural and geographic boundaries. The Mediterranean’s bustling commercial networks served as a conduit for stories, knowledge, and people, bridging distant shores.  During this era, Italians held sway as the Mediterranean’s foremost commercial and naval power, a dominance reflected in the multitude of short story collections written from the 12th to the 14th Centuries. Figures like Giovanni Boccaccio, Franco Sacchetti, and Giovanni Sercambi skillfully portrayed the sociological, geographical, historical, and psychological intricacies of this cultural crossroads.  The short story explored diverse themes, including courtly love, the Crusades, the interplay of the three Monotheistic Religions, class struggles, varied perspectives on women’s roles from Spain to the Arabic domains, and encounters between different cultures. This genre provided a window into the era’s multifaceted facets.  This course aims to delve into the historical tapestry of the multiethnic and multicultural Italian peninsula during the Late Middle Ages. Through Italian short stories, we will explore its cultures, geography, and traditions, gaining insights into this captivating period.

Traditionally, they have operated in silos, but this course seeks to bring them together to address six multidisciplinary challenges facing contemporary society, including:  𝐓𝐡𝐞 (𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐝) 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞-𝐨𝐟𝐟 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲/𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲— How do societies balance the need for efficiency with a view to preventing or reducing inequality? Is this perceived trade-off actually a trade-off?  𝐊𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐥𝐞𝐝𝐠𝐞, 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐭𝐡: 𝐚 𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧-𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 — What is the root of innovation? How do external motivators and intrinsic motivations interact to stimulate growth? What is the role of government in these questions, and how has the European Union approached them?  𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 — How can we protect the environment and ensure a thriving ecosystem for generations to come while meeting our socio-economic needs? What is the relationship between sustainability and innovation in today’s rapidly evolving green tech market?  𝐑𝐨𝐛𝐨𝐭𝐬, 𝐀𝐈, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐮𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 — To what extent will the rapid iteration of AI technology affect the world of work? How is the deployment of generative AI unique compared to previous automation movements?  𝐆𝐥𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐥 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐬, 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐝𝐲𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐬 — How do nations and businesses fit a value chain that occurs across borders?  𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐦 𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐲, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐠𝐚𝐩 — How does the growing wage gap, even across firms in the same sector, relate to questions of inequality?  Students will learn about how the European Union is addressing each challenge, as well as offering space for reflection on global responses. Students will come away from the course with a strong understanding of how Europe and the world see each topic and the implications for future policy decisions, ethics, and diplomacy.
LLRO 30605	From country pastor to cathedral villain, from merciful bishop to weaselly lecher, the image of the Roman Catholic priest in French culture is nothing if not versatile. But what purpose does that versatility serve? Is the image of the priest simply all things to all people as a matter of utility, an easy target - for good or for ill - that provides to authors, artists, or directors a shortcut to a good laugh or to a character that their audience will love to hate? This course will explore the image of the priest in France from the Middle Ages to the present day in its varied manifestations in literature, film, and art. We will examine what the broad spectrum of representations reveals about the state of the French Church at any given moment in history, about the theology of the priesthood, or about clericalism and anticlericalism in a political or social context. In a moment when the meaning of the priesthood in the Catholic Church and beyond continues to be contested, a study of the French context will yield a deeper understanding of the priest and his role as an embodiment of the Church and its authority. Taught in English, with course materials available both in English and the original French.

MARK 20100	A study of markets, institutions, and the environment in which business firms operate with attention to the effect these facets, forces, and issues have on the firm's overall marketing strategy.
MARK 30100	An investigation of the decision-making process of consumer and organizational buyers. The course considers the social, cultural, psychological, and economic dimensions of behavior as they apply to the acquisition of goods and services.
MARK 30120	Required for all marketing majors. A study of the application of scientific method to the definition and solution of marketing problems with attention to research design, sampling theory, methods of data collection and the use of statistical techniques in the data analysis.
MARK 30130	Marketing is an increasingly analytical profession driven by the availability of data and analytical techniques to improve decision making.  This undergraduate course will introduce decision models that rely on financial data, other marketing metrics including web based key performance indicators, as well as statistical analyses.  This course seeks to integrate the various analytical techniques taught in the business school within a marketing context.  This course is appropriate for individuals considering careers in brand management, product management, retail management, marketing research, or consulting.
MARK 30440	The overarching principle of this course is to understand and examine the strategic components of a broader, multichannel (Omni-channel) customer engagement approach. Multichannel customer engagement has become an imperative to preserving existing relationships and growing customer value across a broad spectrum of industries. In this course, we will examine customer acquisition, customer retention and customer expansion strategies using online and mobile marketing methods and tools currently in vogue. Students will work on hands on projects to develop an integrated marketing presence for firms with targeted and dynamic content to maximize customer engagement
MARK 30450	There are billions of fans of sports worldwide and the challenge for the increasingly competitive industry is to grow business.  Thus the sports marketing industry is growing and those who practice sports marketing have become instrumental to the industry and their firms.  Consequently, the current demand for employees that are both highly knowledgeable about sports and extremely prepared for an ever-challenging industry is high.  Accordingly, the goals of this class are twofold.  First, this course fulfills a need to address business and marketing issues pertinent to sports as observed by practitioners and scholars.  Secondly, this course will actively involve and engage students in the process of presenting and addressing current information and challenges in the sports marketing business.  Critical thinking exercises and current cases will be required in this course.  These pedagogical methods will enable students to apply previously learned marketing knowledge and key concepts to business up to date situations faced by actual sports brands and executives.  Sports are a global phenomenon that crosses all societal barriers.  It is a very serious, growing, and challenging business.  The demand for competent students entering into the field of sports marketing is very high but the delivery of graduates who are truly trained and prepared for successful careers in sports marketing is low.  This course will assist in addressing that gap for those students interesting in the world of sports marketing.
MARK 30460	&quot;Rapid technological development and the increasing transparency of information have changed the way marketers interact with current and potential customers.  The rise of the 'Internet Generation' and the increasing popularity of social platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube, Foursquare, and Twitter, as well as the proliferation of customer and company blogs have forced companies to develop fundamentally new strategies and tactics for monitoring and reaching customers.   In this class, we will look at what companies around the world are doing to leverage social media as a critically important marketing tool.  The course will focus on the seller side of social media and depend heavily on outside experts and case examples.  We will examine the dynamic strategies and tactics that leading companies are using to supplement their traditional marketing with a wide variety of social media platforms, blogs, dashboards, and the like.  We will see how companies enhance their marketing by using social media to more closely monitor customers and competitors, to improve lead generation, to build more credible reference stories and contacts, to conduct low cost and quick customer surveys, to clarify market misperceptions, to guide market solution development and refinement, and many other uses.&quot;
MARK 30470	Marketing's timeless responsibilities are being augmented by new imperatives, as strong market forces and enhanced customer expectations are requiring firms and institutions to reimagine and transform their customer engagement strategies in entirely new ways. How each of us live, work, interact and buy continue to fundamentally change. Digital Marketing is an essential and powerful component of modern marketing, and a driving force for how firms establish and strengthen customer relationships.  This course will introduce Digital Marketing frameworks that enable firms to deeply understand and engage with each of their customers and prospects across their buyer's journey.  In this class, we will review and apply digital marketing strategies to build social media eminence, effectively engage customers and prospects, and successfully promote brands, products and services with data driven tools and techniques. Frameworks that enable firms to deploy a digital-first integrated marketing strategy with a measurement system to sense and respond to in-market performance indicators will be examined.
MARK 30500	Increasingly, business firms approach advertising and promotion from an integrated marketing communications perspective which recognizes the importance of coordinating the various promotional mix elements to develop more effective marketing programs. In this course, the roles of advertising, consumer and trade promotions, sponsorships, branded entertainment and viral marketing will be examined within this broader framework. Emphasis will be placed on developing the key concepts and theories of marketing communications as well as the analytic skills needed to apply these concepts to managerial decision making. Although there will be much discussion about communication theory, the primary focus will be on the problems and tasks involved in the management of marketing communications. Ethical and regulatory issues related to unfairness and deception will also be examined.
MARK 30650	A study of the role of the salesperson and the function of sales management in creating close and productive buyer-seller relationships in the business-to-business domain. Emphases in the course are placed on trends affecting the sales person's role, the effects of the internal and external environment on the selling function, and the value of the salesperson to the firm and society.
MARK 40150	This course will teach you how marketing managers make decisions about pricing and distribution, using data. We begin with understanding pricing and promoting to an individual customer, and use this foundation as we move to more aggregate decisions, such as setting regular and promoted prices at the product level and managing category pricing. A key part of the class is understanding the limitations of different types of data and how better planning can both simplify the analysis and increase your confidence in the findings. This class is designed to be very practical and hands-on. A working knowledge of statistics (e.g., t-test and regression analysis) is required and you will learn R for the analysis.
MARK 40400	A review of the brands making the biggest impact in our lives today and why.  Why they are strong, how they got that way and what it takes to keep them there.  Why some brands are merely good and why some brands become great.  Included too will be the &quot;what if's&quot;: not only brands that tried and failed but a look at the differences inherent in competing brands within the same industry--some strong, some weak--and the strategic choices that yielded their success (or lack of it). The course will involve case studies and analysis, with guest lectures from some of the country's top brand stewards.  The goal is to give students a solid framework for understanding the thinking brought to bear in virtually every consumer business in America.
MARK 40470	Applied Digital Marketing will provide an experiential learning opportunity for students to elevate the brand equity and enrollment profile of the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business by blending the theory of digital marketing with the practical demands of managing highly-targeted, data- driven digital marketing campaigns. Students will spearhead the design, build, and execution phases of a digital marketing campaign for COB (or appropriate client), focused on a particular channel (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.), program (Graduate Business, Executive Ed, Non-Profit Admin, etc.), or target audience. Course objectives include developing a deep understanding and application of the art and science of a digital-first demand management system.
MATH 10120	For students in arts and letters. Topics include the fundamental principles of counting systematically, probability, statistics, linear programming, optimization problems, game theory, and mathematical finance. Other topics that may be covered include population problems, difference equations and modeling, and coding information. There is a wealth of applications of these topics to contemporary social, economic, and political issues appealing to liberal arts students. Also, these topics broaden a student's mathematical horizon in an interesting direction not covered by calculus, which deals mostly with continuous models.
MATH 10130	For students in arts and letters.  Provide the students with some formal tools for analyzing arguments. By writing proofs in a formal system, students see the importance of stating the basic premises in an argument and giving intermediate steps that lead to the conclusion.  They learn strategies for thinking up proofs.  They see that proof checking is, in principle, something that a machine could do. Students learn truth tables and see an effective procedure that they could apply to any argument stated in propositional logic, to determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.  There is nothing like truth tables for predicate logic.  Students get to experience doing what mathematicians do, trying to determine whether a particular conclusion follows from some premises by searching simultaneously for a proof or a counterexample. Writing papers gives students an opportunity to explore other topics in logic of their interest. 
MATH 10250	Calculus can be summarized as the study of change.  Several fundamental ideas of calculus are over 2000 years old.  This course is designed to build upon students' intuition to establish why the main ideas in calculus are natural and true, through consideration of the instantaneous position and velocity of a moving object.  We will then be introducing 21st century techniques including Computer Algebra Systems to expand upon that intuition and generalize the main ideas of calculus to a variety of fields, including economics and life sciences.  Students will be challenged to acquire a deep, personal understanding of calculus through reading the text and completing preview activities on their own, working on activities in small groups in class, and doing substantial exercises outside of class time. This course will strengthen students' written and oral communication skills by having them write about and explain aloud the key ideas of calculus.
MATH 10270	This is a second mathematics course for Arts and Letters and Architecture students. As the Roman architect Vitruvius pointed out 2000 years ago, architecture is a broad enterprise bringing together virtually all the elements of the human experience: spirituality, intelligence and creativity, economics, politics and sociology, as well as aesthetics, structural engineering, and mathematics. The agenda of this course has a focus on the last three: aesthetics, structural aspects, and related mathematics. The architecture of the world's great historic buildings will be the environment in which the narrative of this course is developed. The aesthetic and structural properties of these structures will be described following a chronological line. Whenever the opportunity presents itself, this discussion will be informed by basic modern mathematics (such as geometry, trigonometry, and calculus). While the mathematical comments about the buildings considered are standard by today's criteria, they would (for the most part) have been beyond the reach of the architects who built them.
MATH 10360	This is the second course of the two-semester Calculus sequence for Life and Social science majors.

MATH 36800	This is a course where we will examine a number of different problems or big theorems from a variety of different fields of mathematics.  Through the semester we will work through a book which covers in each chapter a different problem from a different area of mathematics, and students will read material independently and present to each other in weekly meetings.  The style of the work for the course will mimic a directed reading or undergraduate research in mathematics.    Any student who wants to know more about what math research might look like, and who wants to learn about various fields of mathematics. Ideally students taking this course will have had either MATH 10850, MATH 10860, MATH 20610 or MATH 20630 already, but exceptions can be made. Ideally this course would be a precursor to future directed readings or a senior thesis.  Students interested in this class should contact the mathematics department for more information.
MATH 40210	Combinatorics is the study of objects that are fundamentally discrete (made up of distinct and separated parts) as opposed to continuous. For example, instead of studying differential equations to see how a system evolves as time passes continuously, we study recurrence relations to see how some quantity changes as time increments unit by unit; in place of the functions on the real line studied in analysis, combinatorics looks at functions on a finite set.  Combinatorics has been increasing in importance in recent decades, in part because of the advent of digital computers (which operate and store data discretely), and in part because of the recent ubiquity of large discrete networks (social, biological, ecological, ...).  Typical objects studied in combinatorics include graphs (networks consisting of nodes, some pairs of which are joined), permutations (arrangements of distinct objects in various different orders), and finite sets and their subsets.  There are many aspects of combinatorics, such as enumerative, structural (e.g., when is it possible to travel around a network, visiting each edge once and only once?), extremal (e.g., if you know which pairs of people in a class don't like each other, what's the smallest number of groups the class can be broken up into, with no two enemies together in a group?), and algorithmic (e.g., if you know the cost of connecting each possible pair of a set of towns, how can you find the most economical network that fully connects up the towns?).  In this course, we will explore each of these aspects of combinatorics, and maybe some more as time permits.

MBA 60370	Business and government leaders are increasingly recognizing the importance of involving the whole organization in making strategic decisions in order to compete globally. Because an organization usually commits the bulk of its human and financial assets to operations, operations is an important function in meeting global competition. Successful firms have demonstrated that operations can be an effective competitive weapon and, in conjunction with well-conceived marketing and financial plans, these firms have made major penetrations into markets worldwide. This course is designed to address key operations and logistical issues in manufacturing as well as service organizations. Students will understand the role of operations managers in the overall business strategy of the firm and be able to identify and evaluate the key factors in the design of effective operating systems for the production of products or services. The course also covers a range of tools appropriate for the analysis of operating systems and offers an opportunity to discuss and compare various approaches to operations management in an international context. This course introduces a framework to understand the way materials and information flow within and between businesses. This course also introduces tools and concepts that can be used to make the flow of information and materials more efficient and effective. Firms today compete on multiple dimensions - they must align their processes to whatever competitive choices they make. Managers must be familiar with the many issues and concepts within this area as all functional areas follow processes of some sort and the best companies will continually improve these processes efficiencies or effectiveness in order to win (and retain) customers. Because the course deals with the management of &quot;processes,&quot; it applies to both for-profit and non-profit organizations, to both service and manufacturing organizations, and to virtually any functional area or industry. The aim of this course is to (1) familiarize students with the problems and issues within processes, and (2) provide students with language, concepts, insights and tools to solve these issues in order to gain competitive advantage through more efficient and effective processes.

MBA 60453	In today's interconnected global economy, there is a growing realization that we must restore public trust in business. Integrating environmental, social and governance issues into corporate management is the overriding purpose of the United Nations Global Compact and its ten principles. This is the heart of the corporate sustainability movement and an effective way to restore trust in business. Take one look at the smog that hangs over the former Olympic host city Beijing and it becomes abundantly clear globalization and economic expansion come at a price. Resource depletion, worker exploitation, pollution and corruption this is the dark underbelly of globalization that has raised alarm bells around the world. Thankfully, more and more individuals and organizations are waking up to the social, environmental and ethical costs of a global marketplace and are making a sound business case for a new era of moral capitalism. Leading the way in this regard is the United Nations with its groundbreaking Global Compact initiative. Launched in 2000, the Global Compact now has more than 10,000 participants including 7,000 businesses in 140 countries around the world making it the world's largest voluntary corporate social responsibility project. COURSE OBJECTIVES: 1. To introduce the student to the United National Global Compact and why its focus on human rights, labor rights, environmental issues and corruption is so attractive to the many stakeholders of business. 2. To develop the ability to think clearly about how one integrates environmental, social and governance issues into corporate management. 3. To develop a sensitivity to the moral and ethical values that enable companies to restore public trust in business. 4. To understand how a number of companies are implementing the principles of the Global Compact by examining case studies. 5. To examine and understand the changing role of business in society.

MBA 70242	Among the most important decisions faced by corporate financial managers is the question of how to allocate the firm's scarce resources. Firms with available cash must decide whether to distribute that cash to their shareholders or retain the cash to invest on their shareholders' behalf. Firms retaining cash must further decide whether to invest in organic expansion or conduct mergers and/or acquisitions. This course takes an in-depth look at capital allocation decisions. In it, we will expand on the general concepts of cost of capital estimation and project evaluation presented in the core finance course. In particular, we will consider complex valuation decisions such as choosing between mutually exclusive projects with unequal lives, setting contract bid prices, and decisions that require real options analysis (e.g., early stage R&amp;D investments, staged investments, project expansions, and project abandonment decisions). We will also consider the impact of forecasting risk on our investment decisions and explore techniques for measuring and managing risk exposures.

As such, it probably comes as no surprise that more projects fail than succeed. The purpose of this course is to provide you frameworks, concepts, and tools that you can use to successfully deliver business value through projects. Guided by the Project Management Institute's (PMI) Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), we will do a deep dive into project management concepts and definitions that will prepare you to deliver projects successfully and position you to earn your Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. No project management class would be complete, however, without an underlying knowledge of popular and successful Agile project management methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, so we will cover those frameworks and concepts as well. Lastly, to round out your project management knowledge, we will cover what is often the most challenging part of delivering projects; Change Management or the people side of change.The underlying goal of this class is to teach you how to deliver the right solution, the right way, delivered on time and on budget, which is used and embraced by your customers to deliver business value. Put another way, this class will help you to succeed as a project manager and not become another failed project statistic.
MBA 70390	Humanitarian disasters impact human life now more than ever. Humanitarian operations and supply chain management reduce this impact and improve our preparedness for future disasters. Data analytics support decision making in humanitarian operations characterized by uncertainty, decentralization, scarce budgets, and the need for fast and equitable service. This course applies analytics to humanitarian operations and identifies lessons business can learn from this setting. With an emphasis on humanitarian supply chain management, this course studies the use of analytics for demand planning, inventory prepositioning, donations and volunteer management, procurement, warehousing, transportation management, and the last-mile distribution of aid.
MBA 70410	MBA Core; 1st Year MBA Only. It is difficult to picture an upper-level manager who has not mastered the skills of managing people. Executives must be efficient leaders, motivators and team managers. Furthermore, research suggests that these &quot;soft&quot; skills are critical determinants of promotions to the upper echelon of managerial positions. Organizational behavior is about developing these skills. Through lecture, case analysis and class discussion, we develop a deep appreciation for the things that distinguish effective from ineffective managers. Special attention will be paid to the topics of selection, motivation, leadership and managing teams. The overall objective of the course is to apply theories of human behavior to solve day-to-day problems of organizational administration, help students become more aware of their own managerial styles and ultimately become more effective managers.
MBA 70415	MBA Core; First Year MBA Only. The scope and role of strategic management encompasses a general management perspective that involves internal and external analysis, complex decision-making, and implementation of these decisions.

This course focuses on the management of the multinational corporation (MNC). The objective of this course is to provide MBA students with a basic understanding of how to conduct business across cultures and borders. Particular attention will be given to: specific managerial challenges and opportunities faced by MNCs; knowledge and conceptual frameworks necessary to understand and manage MNCs; the political, economic and legal environments in which MNCs operate; the effect of national cultures on international management; the strategy and organization of MNCs including entry strategies, strategic alliances, joint ventures as well as organization structures and issues of control and coordination; topics related to individual behavior within MNCs, such as motivation and leadership in a global context and international business careers.
MBA 70437	"On July 28, 2022 the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) declared that living in a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is a human right (UN <a href=""/search/?p=GA%202022"" data-action=""result-detail"" data-group=""code:GA 2022""  class=""notoffered"">GA 2022</a>). Similarly, founded on the basic principles of protect, respect, and remedy, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights set standards for states and corporations, whether domestic or international, for maintaining and promoting human rights (UN OHCHR 2021). Taken together, these declarations and standards imply that businesses complying with them must account for the excess environmental risk and hazard produced by their operations as well as their potential contribution to environmental violence. While many tend to juxtapose these goals as antithetical to one another, given the historical outsized effect of business in producing environmental hazards, in fact enterprise is the key mode for regeneration. In this course, which will center on skills-training and state-of-the-art learning on regenerative enterprise development, students will apply sustainable business praxis through service learning with partnering international organizations. Students—who are our future enterprise, policy, law, science and engineering leaders—will co-create regenerative livelihoods through collaborative planning with their partners and the communities most impacted by environmental hazards and other social ills degrading livelihood options. Working hand-in-hand with partners digitally all semester and in-person during Spring Break, students will experience firsthand the power of enterprise to regenerate a sustainable future for people suffering these intersecting challenges the most, while learning critical skills that are increasingly in demand (e.g., ESG consulting is the fastest growing area in consultancy today), preparing them to craft and employ enterprise as a ‘noble vocation’ towards integral human development and flourishing."

MBA 70468	The objective of this advanced strategy class is to help students develop the ability to improve firm performance through strategic business model innovation. Although significant elements of this class will focus on strategy frameworks and theoretical tools for understanding business models, we will also work on developing leadership skills for advancing frame-breaking ideas in both dynamic and rigid organizations. Core theoretical models of bounded rationality and core rigidities will be examined to understand the structure of psychological and organizational resistance to fresh leadership and ideas. The fundamentals of &quot;blue ocean&quot; strategies will be examined deeply in addition to a range of cases in a wide variety of industries. The underlying theme of the course will be to help students develop a rigorous and continuous method of thinking outside-of-the-box to consider how sustainable competitive advantage can be achieved through market-making and dramatic strategic initiatives rather than just incremental strategy and just-better-than-the-competition execution.
MBA 70474	The purpose of this course is to introduce the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings.

Accordingly, the goal of the course is to inform participants how to engage in market research. Specifically, students will learn a) to critically evaluate what information is necessary to make more informed decisions, b) the various approaches organizations use to obtain the information, and c) the most commonly used techniques necessary to analyze the data. In the process, course participants will have the opportunity to manage and conduct a research project for a client of their choosing.
MBA 70511	The gap between marketing theory and marketing practice has narrowed considerably due to the availability of data and practical methods of analyzing and using that data. Students will learn how theoretical models are implemented to make practical decisions; this includes formal models as well as simple marketing metrics. Representative topics include marketing return on investment, customer lifetime value, other key performance indicators, and optimal marketing mix allocation decisions. This course is appropriate for individuals considering careers in brand management, product management, retail management, or consulting.
MBA 70520	This course will teach you how to use analytics and data to address decisions faced by marketing managers with emphasis on pricing and promotion decisions. The course is organized around a hierarchy of topics. We begin with understanding pricing and promoting to an individual customer, and use this foundation as we move to more aggregate decisions, such as setting regular and promoted prices at the product level, managing category pricing, and store analytics. As we progress through this hierarchy of decisions, we understand how different types of data can---or can't---be used to answer managerial questions. A key part of the class is understanding the limitations of different types of data and how better planning can both simplify the analytics and increase your confidence in the findings. This class is designed to be very practical and hands-on. A working knowledge of statistics (e.g., t-test and regression analysis) is required and you will learn R for data analysis.
MBA 70522	Advertising Management provides an opportunity to learn the management process through which organizations, taking a collaborative approach to consumers, develop and present messages of value that engage targeted audiences and encourage attitudinal, emotional, and behavioral responses.

MBA 70590	In this course you will learn and apply an actionable framework for building growth strategy that applies to any organization: small, large, for-profit, non-profit. The core of the process is uncovering the broad landscape of growth opportunities and then zeroing in on deeply understanding the value sought by customers and breaking down that value (both known and unknown) into actionable parts. You'll learn how to then build a growth strategy plan around a unique value proposition that leverages the firm's key capabilities and corrects for existing points of non-value. Plans will also emphasize how to build a customer-centric perspective into the organization. Each student will be involved in a team growth strategy project, building a growth plan for either a for-profit or non-profit organization.
MBA 70699	What is the role of business in a just and humane society? Many of you are about to dedicate your lives to business, and the rest of you will work, in one way or another, with business. Yet many people believe that business is a morally suspicious activity, a suspicion evident in the common belief that business people need to &quot;give back&quot; to society. Is business an activity for which one must atone? Are people right to be suspicious of business? This course is designed to engage ideas from the Catholic tradition with perspectives drawn from moral philosophy, business, and economics. We will engage issues of faith and normativity both critically and constructively. Students will consider competing positions on faith and normative questions, will reflect on (or discover elements of) their own faith or non-faith, and will describe the extent to which they believe various claims are supported by faith or reason. This course responds to Pope John Paul II's Centesimus Annus (1991) and Pope Francis's Laudato Si (2015), which called on Catholic education to &quot;safeguard the moral conditions for an authentic 'human ecology'&quot; (Centesimus Annus, 38).

Students will work on hands on projects to develop an integrated marketing presence for firms with targeted and dynamic content to maximize customer engagement 
MDMK 30460	Rapid technological development and the increasing transparency of information have changed the way marketers interact with current and potential customers. The rise of the 'Internet Generation' and the increasing popularity of social platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube, Foursquare, and Twitter, as well as the proliferation of customer and company blogs have forced companies to develop fundamentally new strategies and tactics for monitoring and reaching customers.

MDMK 30470	Marketing's timeless responsibilities are being augmented by new imperatives, as strong market forces and enhanced customer expectations are requiring firms and institutions to reimagine and transform their customer engagement strategies in entirely new ways. How each of us live, work, interact and buy continue to fundamentally change. Digital Marketing is an essential and powerful component of modern marketing, and a driving force for how firms establish and strengthen customer relationships. This course will introduce Digital Marketing frameworks that enable firms to deeply understand and engage with each of their customers and prospects across their buyer's journey. In this class, we will review and apply digital marketing strategies to build social media eminence, effectively engage customers and prospects, and successfully promote brands, products and services with data driven tools and techniques. Frameworks that enable firms to deploy a digital-first integrated marketing strategy with a measurement system to sense and respond to in-market performance indicators will be examined.
MDSC 20009	&quot;Introduction to Data Science&quot; is an introductory course that will provide an overview of data science from both a computer science perspective and a social science perspective; This course will orient students to the field, to key concepts, to the types of questions addressed, to the technical aspects of data science and to the process of making sense of data.
MDSC 20110	&quot;Hacking&quot; is one of the most pressing topics of technological and societal interest. Yet, it is one of the most misunderstood and mischaracterized practices in the public sphere, given its ethical and technical complexities. In this course we will combine anthropological and computer science methods to explore the digital tools, practices, and sociocultural histories of hacking with a focus on their context of occurrence from the late 1960s to the present. Our goal is to help students think anthropologically about computing as well as technically about the digital mediations that we depend on in our lives.
MDSC 30005	Politics, markets, and the environment are all spheres of development that are fundamentally shaped by the action and interaction of many individuals over time. For example, the Arab Spring protests, the shortage of medicines in Caracas, and the rising water temperatures of the Baltic Sea are all system-level outcomes arising from the individual actions of thousands or even billions of people. In these spheres, leadership is often weak or non-existent. Scientists call these &quot;complex systems.&quot; Complexity is difficult to study in the real world. Instead, scientists often approach these phenomenon using computer simulations (sometimes called agent-based models, social network models, and computational models). The goal is to build computer models of development that link the actions and interactions of individuals to the system-level outcomes. This class will use the perspective, literature, and tools of complexity science to approach core questions in the field of development.
MDSC 30056	This course will provide advanced undergraduates and graduate students with a critical introduction to digital humanities for the study of early China, the fountainhead of Chinese Civilization. Collaborating with the Center of Digital Scholarship, this course will focus on relational data with structured information on historical figures, especially high officials, of early Chinese empires. Throughout the semester, we will read academic articles, mine data from primary sources, and employ Gephi and ArcGIS to visualize data. Those constructed data will cover three major themes: how geographical mobility contributed to the solidarity of an newly unified empire over diversified regions, how social networks served as the hidden social structure channeling the flow of power and talents, and how criminal records and excavated legal statutes shed light on the unique understanding of law and its relationship with the state power in Chinese history. 
MDSC 30104	Feminism isn't only about women, nor is feminism only for women. Feminism is about power - about who has it and who doesn't. And in today's world, data is power. Data can be used to create communities, advance research, and expose injustice. But data can also be used to discriminate, marginalize, and surveil. This course will draw intersectional feminist theory and activism to identify models for challenging existing power differentials in data science, with the aim of using data science methods and tools to work towards justice. Class meetings will be split between discussions of theoretical readings and explorations of data science tools and methods (such as Tableau, RStudio, and Python). Those readings may include chapters from texts that include Catherine D'Ignazio  and Lauren Klein's Data Feminism (2020), Virginia Eubanks's Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor (2018), Ruha Benjamin's Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code (2019), and Sasha Costanza-Chock's Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need (2020). This course will also examine the data advocacy and activism work undertaken by groups like Our Data Bodies, Data for Black Lives, the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, and Chicago-based Citizens Police Data Project. Over the course of the semester, students will develop original research projects that use data to intervene in issues of inequality and injustice.  This course is not about gaining mastery of particular data science tools or methods, therefore familiarity with statistical analysis or data science tools (R, RStudio, Python, etc.) is NOT a prerequisite for this course.
MDSC 33201	This course is aimed to provide a basic understanding of how Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and satellite imagery can be used to visualize and analyze environmental data. Students will learn basic techniques for analyzing, manipulating and creating geospatial data in both pixel-based (satellite imagery and digital terrain models) and vector based (point, line and polygon representation of spatial data) formats. Students will also learn how acquire high resolution satellite imagery and other GIS data from online data servers.
MDSC 40211	The course covers the core methods necessary to read and conduct economic research using examples from the Public Finance literature. Students should have a good understanding of statistical inference and linear regression methods to be eligible. The course stresses the practical implementation of various econometric methodologies to analyze longitudinal datasets and &quot;big data.&quot; Lectures will provide a comprehensive introduction to Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and survey design, quasi-experimental research designs, non-parametric methods, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), time series econometrics, and modern machine learning. The course will also provide a refresher on hypothesis testing and model specification testing.

MDSC 40811	This course is designed to achieve three objectives: (1) introduce you to research and quantitative analysis in political science, (2) help you become critical consumers of political information and policy-oriented reporting, and (3) give you the ability to answer questions of social scientific importance using data. Throughout the course, we'll discuss the complexities of generating good research designs, starting with how to ask interesting questions and how to measure concepts of interest to social scientists. Students in this course will learn to understand the most common statistical techniques used in political science and acquire the skills necessary to use these techniques and interpret their results. A mastery of these techniques is essential for understanding research on public opinion and voting behavior, electoral studies, and comparative research on the causes of democracy. The target audience for this course is undergraduate students with interest in the social sciences (not only Political Science), who want to use quantitative approaches to solve important problems, as well as develop marketable analytical skills.
MDSC 40815	This course is an introduction to political, economic, and social issues through the medium of visual displays. This kind of course has become feasible because data are now abundant and easy to access and software for displaying and analyzing data are available and easy to use. The ability to examine and display data is an increasingly valuable skill in many fields. However, this skill must be complemented by the ability to interpret visual displays orally, and by a commitment to use data responsibly: to reveal, rather than slant or distort, the truth. We will discuss examples concerning drugs, marriage, climate change, development, economic performance, social policy, democracy, voting, public opinion, and conflict, but the main emphasis is on helping you explore many facets of an issue of particular interest to you. You will learn to manage data and produce your own graphics to describe and explain political, social, economic (or other!) relationships. The graphics will include line and bar graphs, 2D and 3D scatterplots, motion charts, maps, and others.
MDSC 48000	Directed Research in Data Science offers students a chance to engage in hands-on research, either by working on a faculty member's research project or by pursuing one's own research question unrelated to a senior thesis project. By the end of this course, students should demonstrate a deepened sense of empiricism and methodological understanding. This is a graded course, and a formal application is required. (See the DUS for a copy.) Students engaged in a faculty member's research project should work out a study plan and evaluation process for assigning a final grade with the faculty member. Students engaged in their own research project should (1) submit their research questions, hypotheses, data source, and methodology to their faculty director at the time of application to the course, and (2) submit a written research report by the end of the semester, as part of the final evaluation process. Department Approval Required.
MDSC 48009	The senior capstone project provides the iTREDS scholars the opportunity to work in interdisciplinary teams and with external stakeholders on topics that require data science fundamentals and application. iTREDS scholars co-create their project with a stakeholder partner (industry or community-based/regional or not-for-profit organization).

In addition to the completion of Lambdin's elementary grammar, students are introduced to some (modified) Biblical texts. 
MELC 20033	The Thousand and One Nights, also known as the Arabian Nights, is a collection of tales originated in the Arab lands that has become a masterpiece of world literature. These enchanting stories, framed by the tale of Scheherazade (or Shahrazad), have enjoyed a widespread and varied reputation over the centuries and across cultures. It is said that the Thousand and One Nights is the most read (or heard about) book in human history, second only to Bible. In this class, we will examine these stories from a variety of academic and cultural perspectives, taking advantage of the wealth of material available (both textual and audio-visual). We will examine issues of provenance: where did these stories originate and when? We will study the stories as literary texts as well as historical documents, asking what, if anything, they tell us about the cultures they reflect and the societies in which they are set. We will examine how these tales have been interpreted by later societies, both Arab and Western, and what those interpretations tell us about the interpreters. We will use this class and its content to introduce ourselves to the study of the Middle East, its languages, history, literature, and peoples. We will gain a better understanding of the analytical tools and techniques for the study and appreciation of literature in general.  
MELC 20055	This course examines the history of the Middle East from the late eighteenth century to the Arab uprisings of 2011. We will approach cultural, social, political and intellectual transformations in the Middle East. We will pursue a number of themes including engagements with modernity; reactions to Western colonial expansion; religious and secular reform movements; nationalism and revolution; changes in gender and family experiences; the Arab-Israeli conflict; the impact of oil and the Cold War; postcolonial state-building; the rise of political Islam and piety movements; globalization and economic disparities; and movements for democracy and social justice.
MELC 20101	"This course aims at introducing students to the history of the Arab world. Through a panoramic view encompassing twelve centuries of Arab history and culture, we look at all sides of this rich and venerable civilization: the beauty of the Alhambra and the great mosques, the importance attached to education, the achievements of Arab science—but also internal conflicts, widespread poverty, the role of women, and the contemporary Palestinian question.  	We explore how the religion of Islam created a far-flung Arab Muslim world that embraced lands reaching from the shores of the Atlantic to Iraq and the Indian Ocean. Each has its own geographical features and historical traditions, yet certain themes and experiences are common to all: the rise and spread of Islam, the growth of the Ottoman Empire, the expansion of European trade and empire, and in the last decades, the challenge of Islamic resurgence and integration into a new kind of world. We attempt at a clear and comprehensive interpretation of the paths of the Muslim religion, its divisions, its authorities and traditions, its current contradictory powers to unite and to divide. 	Throughout, social institutions and culture are intertwined with politics and economics. The texts we read in this class are studded with famous names from the past—Ibn Khaldun, al-Ghazali, and Ibn Sina (Avicenna); Saladin and ‘Abd al-Nasir (Nasser)—as well as with those of the recent memory—Hafiz al-Asad and Saddam Husayn; the Nobel Prize winner Najib Mahfuz, the cultural critic Edward Said and popular singer Umm Kulthum."
MELC 30023	This interdisciplinary course offers a topical survey of the relationships between biological sex, culturally bound notions of &quot;masculinity&quot; and &quot;femininity,&quot; and the gendered body in the Islamic tradition. The primary aim of the course is to explore the intersection of religion and social constructions of gender and the body in a variety of historical and cultural contexts in the Muslim World. Students read and interpret religious texts and commentaries, literary and legal texts, women's writings, and media in English translation. Coursework focuses on increasing students' understanding of the diversity of scholarly views on women's bodies as sites of piety and sites of political and social contestation (reproductive rights, public vs. private space, etc.).
MELC 30525	In 1965, the Second Vatican Council issued a &quot;Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions&quot;, which contains a statement that Muslims &quot;submit wholeheartedly to even His inscrutable decrees, just as Abraham, with whom the faith of Islam takes pleasure in linking itself, submitted to God.&quot; While the Declaration can be understood as recognizing the possible validity of Islam's claim to Abrahamic status, some scholars have introduced the notion of &quot;Abrahamic religions&quot; as a way of associating Judaism, Christianity and Islam as related faiths. This course will explore the defining features of the Abrahamic religions that tie them closely together as well as their particularities and differences. As the youngest of the three Abrahamic religions, Islam has a lot of things to say about Abraham which largely correspond to the Biblical story although the Qur'an also contains some novel features, including the claim that Abraham, together with Ishmael, built the Ka‘bah. This course will discuss how the scriptures of the three religions emerged within the same cultural milieu, and explore their intertwined histories and the ways in which Jews, Christians, and Muslims developed their own independent religious identities from their early encounters to the present. Students will also be introduced to some basic teachings of Islam. No prior knowledge of Islam is required.
MELC 40700	‘Islam and Violence’, and ‘Islam and Terror’, are familiar topics that have become increasingly popular in the media in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. These topics were spawned by events such as the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the attacks on the United States of America in September 2001, the Bush administration’s subsequent ‘war on terror’ in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Arab Spring which began in North Africa in 2011, followed in 2014 by the grotesque violence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). In contradistinction, to the plethora of courses focussing on Islam and Terrorist Violence, this course seeks to critically examine the Islamic theologies of nonviolence and peacebuilding articulated and embodied by a number of Muslim scholars. Students are not expected to emerge from this course as experts on the Islamic ethics of peacebuilding, but will be exposed to major Muslim authors and arguments on nonviolence and peacebuilding and be provided with a number of conceptual lenses that can be applied to their analysis of the diverse ways in which Islam is implicated in conflict, violence, and peacebuilding on both a global and local level.
MELC 46801	Individual or small group study under the direction of a faculty member.  Permission of the Department required.
MELC 48005	A research course for the capstone essay for the minor in Mediterranean/Middle East Studies.  May not be double-counted for thesis credit in a major.
MGA 60003	This course will provide an introduction to modern macroeconomic concepts. The course will train students to interpret economic statistics and to understand how fiscal, monetary, trade and exchange rate policies affect the economy. We will discuss how countries can achieve long-run economic growth and how how countries can harness the benefits of globalization while managing the risks. The course will be primarily taught using case studies, will require students to actively participate in class discussions, and place emphasis on the role of quantitative analysis and contextual factors in understanding economic policy.
MGA 60007	Working closely with the organization serving as their Global Partner and with their assigned GPE Mentor, students begin to plan a Global Partner Experience (GPE) that addresses an identified problem or opportunity.  Through this course, students will develop in-depth understanding of their GPE topic, gain insights into the culture, history, and context of their proposed field sites, and formulate a plan to accomplish their fieldwork. ND faculty will share frameworks, methodologies, and perspectives that teams may apply to their GPE based on field placement and context. These activities will draw upon concepts introduced in two other courses offered this semester: Research Design (qualitative and quantitative methods) and Global Actors &amp; Institutions. By the end of this course, students will develop and present a GPE Proposal outlining their work plan and budget, including the fieldwork component.
MGA 60014	The Keough Career Colloquium Series (i) Supports students' ability to discern career paths and possibilities, (ii) within those, it focuses on developing the tools and skills students need to realistically compete in the global affairs marketplace and (iii) identifies the kinds of further information and contacts students need to prepare for and take their next professional steps upon graduation. As the second course in this series, this course will focus on fluency in skills such as networking, using job-search tools, and interviewing.
MGA 60016	The Keough Career Colloquium Series (i) Supports students' ability to discern career paths and possibilities, (ii) within those, it focuses on developing the tools and skills students need to realistically compete in the global affairs marketplace and (iii) identifies the kinds of further information and contacts students need to prepare for and take their next professional steps upon graduation. As the final course in this series, this course will focus on implementing students' job searches using what students have learned in and outside of the classroom to obtain the next professional, educational or experiential step you seek.
MGA 60022	The goal of this course is to ensure that students are on track with internship or Thesis planning and implementation through regular meetings. The instructor prepares students for the internship or Thesis, advises their exploration of internship opportunities or Thesis topics, and facilitates them to identify and secure an internship or Thesis topic and an advisor among Notre Dame faculty in a timely manner. When necessary, internal and/or external guests may be invited to give workshops and help students find and set up an internship. Students need to work with the course instructor and various mentors to identify and develop a potential plan for the summer internship or Thesis, secure a summer internship by the first 2/3 point of the semester, and work out logistical details before the summer. This course is only for Sustainable Development and Governance &amp; Policy students pursuing an internship or Thesis in lieu of continuing with i-Lab.
MGA 60102	This course will introduce students to the key concepts related to conflict transformation and peacebuilding theory and practice as an integrated framework. The primary purposes are to familiarize students with approaches to promote constructive and strategic change processes in settings of deep-rooted conflict and provide them with opportunity to integrate the theory with practical aspects of designing and implementing those strategies on the ground. Students will also be introduced to strategies for reflective thought and practical action that are central to strategic peacebuilding.  During class time, students will be exposed to case studies, simulations, inductive theory development, and elicitive approaches to conflict intervention. This course is required for all MGA students with a Peace Studies concentration.
MGA 60103	The course will provide structured assignments and writing group work to aid students as they produce their individual capstone projects. Students will be expected to continue to consult with their Field Research Advisor as well as with the capstone course instructor during the writing process. The final paper will represent a significant portion of the course grade and will be graded jointly by the seminar instructor and the Field Research Advisor
MGA 60105	In this course we will critically examine issues of trauma and healing as they emerge in conflict situations and as challenges to peacebuilding. The course will be structured in three parts. In Part one, we will examine how theorists from such different disciplines as psychology, psychoanalysis, philosophy and cultural studies have conceptualized trauma and the necessary steps to recovery. In part two, we will review recent anthropological accounts that have emerged from areas of extreme trauma. These accounts will provide the backdrop for assessing the adequacy of the dominant theories of trauma and healing models, especially when these models are taken into cross-cultural contexts. In part three of the course we will reflect on the implications of our examination of trauma and healing for peacebuilding on both the micro and macro levels. We will consider the challenges and possibilities for working with victims of trauma in various cultural situations as well as the reality of secondary traumatic stress experienced by practitioners. On the macro level, we will consider how trauma research might broaden our understanding of ideals of reconciliation, forgiveness and restorative justice, as well as the advisability of truth-telling commissions and war-crimes tribunals.
MGA 60108	In many of the recurring conflicts around the world, at issue are demands for justice. Whether these revolve around economic inequality, political repression, environmental devastation, civil and political rights, ethnic or religious exclusion, or discrimination on the basis of race, class, gender, sexuality or disability status (to name just a few), social movements are often the carriers of these calls for justice. In this course, we will examine how social movements emerge from, contribute to, and suggest resolutions for various types of social conflict, as well as explore their potential contributions to sustainable peacebuilding. We will examine theory and research on how social movements emerge, escalate, consolidate and decline; how they choose (and change) protest tactics; how they articulate their visions and goals; how they generate emotions, solidarity and commitment; how they interact with networks of allies, opponents and powerholders; and how they influence (or fail to influence) agendas, policies, and regimes. We will put a particular emphasis on the comparative study of social movements in different regions of the world, as well as on the challenges and opportunities posed by transnational movements that seek to organize across borders.
MGA 60109	‘Islam and Violence’, and ‘Islam and Terror’, are familiar topics that have become increasingly popular in the media in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. These topics were spawned by events such as the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the attacks on the United States of America in September 2001, the Bush administration’s subsequent ‘war on terror’ in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Arab Spring which began in North Africa in 2011, followed in 2014 by the grotesque violence of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

MGA 60140	This course explores how social media and other new technologies are profoundly reshaping the world, impacting democratic institutions, social cohesion, conflict, and the peacebuilding field. We will engage in deep-rooted analysis of technology's positive and negative impacts on society, drawing on neuroscience, psychology, political analysis, and economic research of the profit models, affordances, and designs of current technology platforms. Students will analyze the impact of digital technology on fifteen global conflicts and explore twenty spheres of digital peacebuilding. The course includes a policy analysis of proposed government regulations on technology companies. Participants will learn through case studies and policy dialogues to identify best practices for using social media to support peacebuilding.
MGA 60141	What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films. Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba).
MGA 60145	This course interrogates the production, reproduction, and persistence of patterns of racial injustice that are manifested in many forms including criminal injustice, housing discrimination, food insecurity, health disparities and educational inequalities. The role of power, place, and institutions as ever-present factors shaping the social world and the matrix of social problems will be identified and evaluated to better examine how racism shapes conditions of violence, poverty, and suffering.
MGA 60204	This course aims to train students to  become informed consumers and producers of empirical research. Students will learn many different methods to identify the causal effects of policies and compare their strengths and weaknesses. These methods include randomized controlled trials, regression analysis, panel data methods, instrumental variables and regression discontinuity. Students will also learn to present the results of policy research to multiple audiences. Students will gain experience working with real data on several smaller assignments and a policy evaluation paper, in addition to a midterm and a final exam.
MGA 60209	In this course, we will examine the creation of &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sexuality&quot; as objects of development practices around the world. While development projects often assume that gender and sexuality are stable, coherent categories of identity, scholars have long shown that both take socially and historically specific forms as they emerge through social practices. In this course we will read a range of critical case studies that demonstrate the complicated ways that local and transnational ideas about gender, sexuality, and development intersect in everyday life around the world. This course will help you approach &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;sexuality&quot;—two key terms in development discourse and global affairs—with an understanding of how these categories shape not just individuals but institutions, processes, and practices.
MGA 60211	The course covers the core methods necessary to read and conduct economic research using examples from the Public Finance literature. Students should have a good understanding of statistical inference and linear regression methods to be eligible. The course stresses the practical implementation of various econometric methodologies to analyze longitudinal datasets and &quot;big data.&quot;  Lectures will provide a comprehensive introduction to Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and survey design, quasi-experimental research designs, non-parametric methods, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), time series econometrics, and modern machine learning. The course will also provide a refresher on hypothesis testing and model specification testing. Readings and practical problem sets will be posted each week to provide hands-on numerical experience to students.|
MGA 60212	What are Beijing's objectives towards the developing world and how have they have evolved and been pursued over time? In light of China's unprecedented Belt and Road Initiative and increasingly assertive military activities far from its shores, the answer to this question is perhaps more important than ever before. This course analyzes and explains China's strategies in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Latin America, and evaluates their effectiveness. It is informed by the functionally organized academic literature, but uses a regional approach that allows for comparisons among regions based on their economic, political, military, and social characteristics. Topics will cut across the overlapping political, economic and security spheres, with particular attention paid to how different developing countries have perceived and responded to China's rapidly growing engagement and influence. This structure allows us to consider not only the unique features of Chinese engagement in each region, but also place them in the larger context of Beijing's strategy towards other developing regions and the developing world as a whole. This course will be of great interest to students and scholars interested in international development, Chinese foreign policy, comparative political economy, and international relations.
MGA 60218	Water is central to the survival of humans and natural ecosystems. However, the scarcity of water has become a critical social and public health issue in the 21st century, and humans play a central role in transforming this critical resource. This course aims to provide students with a holistic understanding of the policy, governance, and institutional processes shaping human-water interactions globally. The course will cover topics ranging from water conflicts, climate-water nexus, water-sanitation-health nexus, politics of water use and management, the human right to water, water infrastructure and pricing, and other related themes through an interdisciplinary, policy lens. The course will also introduce students to relevant social theories, frameworks (for eg. political ecology, environmental justice, social justice), and methods for analyzing global water policy challenges.
MGA 60220	This course introduces the role of economics in environmental issues and in the formation of environmental policy. Topics covered include choice, externalities, market failure, cost-benefit and environmental valuation analyses, and climate change. The course aims to encourage students to think about pressing environmental issues in economic terms and equip students with the diverse set of economics tools to contribute to the evaluation and implementation of wise policy choices. There is no prior knowledge of economics required, and students will have the opportunity to learn basic economic principles and frameworks that guide decision-making regarding environmental issues.
MGA 60221	“Life Cycle Assessment” is a lecture- and practicum-based class primarily targeted at graduate students. The class is designed as a once-per-week session where we will spend about half the time on lectures and the other half on hands-on activities to practice LCA. The class is designed to introduce you to Life Cycle Assessment as a method for evaluating environmental, and social impacts of products, policies, systems, and services, with a focus on International Standards Organization (ISO)-compliant LCA. We will primarily be using OpenLCA, with some exposure to alternative tools. This course will particularly focus on LCA practice in the context of policy development, with emphasis on LCA’s role as a decision support tool. We will address the implications of LCA and related methods being increasingly required in policy contexts (e.g., for prioritizing grant recipients and allocating tax subsidies). We will also address the challenges associated with disparities in the maturity of various life cycle methods, most notably social LCA in comparison to environmental LCA and life cycle costing. We will evaluate published LCAs in forms like Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements, and also investigate the use of life cycle thinking and LCA for Environmental Product Declarations. The course will also emphasize the role of LCA in the energy transition, particularly given LCA’s strong role in greenhouse gas accounting, and explore how both technological and climate dynamics pose challenges for LCA practice. This course is primarily a methods course, and we will work through case studies and examples together both in and out of class, with a topical emphasis on energy, buildings, and climate due to LCA’s particular relevance in those areas.
MGA 60222	“Climate and Environmental Justice” is a lecture- and discussion-based class primarily targeted at undergraduates. It is designed to introduce you to the core and crucial concepts of climate justice and environmental justice, with a particular emphasis on existing legacy injustices and the injustices we are currently creating as environmental pollution, climate change, and human systems interact. We will discuss existing patterns of burden, inequality, poverty, and threats to human dignity, and discuss opportunities and mechanisms to repair and avoid injustice. In particular we will discuss environmental injustice as a widely experienced but largely localized experience of disproportionate burden (e.g., on the basis of race and class) associated with extraction, industrialization, and non-greenhouse gas environmental pollution, alongside climate injustice as a global and emergent phenomenon of severe and disproportionate impacts from climate change. We will address concepts of reparations and remediation, as well as governance and other strategies for enacting justice. We will also address links between climate and environmental justice with related movements focused on adaptation, energy, housing, transportation, health, and land. Our focus will be both domestic and international, with attention directed to power dynamics, vulnerabilities, and opportunities for corrective action. Climate change and the energy transition will be major themes given their deep relationship with both climate and environmental justice, particularly as processes of industrialization and deindustrialization associated with decarbonization proceed. Overall, the course will focus on patterns, drivers, and opportunities for corrective action associated with severe injustices associated with climate change and environmental burden.
MGA 60223	Conserving the earth's rich biological heritage while enhancing the well-being of some of the world's poorest people stands as a critical global challenge. This course examines this complex issue using the lens of political science and related fields such as political ecology, gender studies, and sustainability science. It will demonstrate how insights and approaches from these areas of scholarship can help understand and address the twin problems of biodiversity loss and poverty in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Examples will focus on forest and wildlife conservation and management. This course will be of interest to students from a wide range of natural and social science disciplines.
MGA 60302	This course introduces students to empirical trends and academic debates on the political underpinnings of the global economy. We will examine a range of actors involved in the politics of global markets - governments, international organizations as well as a range of private actors: What role does each of these actors play? How has their influence evolved over the post-War period? What challenges have they been dealing with over time and how successful are they in meeting them? The first part of the class introduces students to recent debates on what global markets are (readings address trends such as liberalization, globalization, and vertical disintegration) and to broad theoretical approaches that theorize global governance. We will then read about and discuss the history, politics, and current challenges of different types of global governance institutions: multilateral institutions and transnational governance arrangements. We will also read about the emergence of private governance regimes and how they interact with public standards and regulations. The class introduces a range of core issue areas debated in the IPE literature (finance, development, migration), and then focuses in some depth on two themes that are emerging as urgent challenges for the global economy: trade and the governance of common pool resources.
MGA 60321	Foundations of Global Policymaking provides students with the intellectual foundations necessary to understand the challenges faced by officials during the policymaking process. Not only will students enhance their knowledge of how foreign policy is made, but they will also learn the skills to support, and one day become, a policymaker. The course has four modules. The first investigates how world views and choices are shaped by cognitive, cultural, normative and decision-making structures. The second examines how regime type, country size, and instability constrain policymakers' options. The third module looks at the numerous domestic and international actors and factors that influence the foreign policymaking process in the United States including the president, intelligence, the Congress, media, NGOs, international institutions, foreign governments, and lobbyists. In the fourth module we examine policymaking in a half-dozen Asian countries - China, Russia, India, Philippines, Vietnam, and Singapore. This comparative approach illustrates how each countries' characteristics such as geography, country size, and regime type, which were introduced in the first module, affect their foreign policymakers' decision making. The course concludes with a simulation in which students are asked to apply what they have learned to a crisis situation based on actual events. In addition to learning about policymaking, students will also learn how to consume, digest, organize complex ideas and information on multiple related topics and explain them in a coherent manner. The ability to find the logical linkages among arguments and synthesize and present their similarities and differences in concise and informative written and spoken products is highly marketable skill. Whether a student plans to work in a corporation, a government agency, think-tank, NGO, multinational corporation, or an international organization it is essential that they be able to weigh different policy options and communicate complex analytical ideas to both superiors and subordinates.
MGA 60322	This course, geared to MGA students in the Governance and Policy concentration, introduces principles and practices of research design with a focus on qualitative and mixed-method approaches. We begin by contrasting different cultures of social scientific research and their varying goals, assumptions, and advantages. We then explore different research methodologies and the types of data and analysis they employ. The course features guest speakers with expertise in different approaches, and practical interludes offer students the chance to link course topics to their own research projects.
MGA 60710	This course provides a basic understanding of how Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to visualize and analyze spatial data. Particularly, the course will concentrate on the applications of GIS in social sciences with a range of modern examples, including crime, health, marketing, urban planning, education, environment, and economics. Students will learn how to use ArcMap to store data, create maps, and perform spatial analysis relevant to research with social sciences data. Students are also required to produce an original GIS research poster to apply skills/tools learned in the classroom.  This course targets graduate students in Social Sciences who completed Quantitative Methods (or with equivalent statistics knowledge).
MGA 60729	This class explores the use of marketing principles and concepts to support initiatives, causes and ventures that are social in nature. Attention is devoted to the marketing and communication challenges involved when attempting to do good, and how these issues can be overcome without spending large amounts of money. Sample topics include identifying and understanding target markets for social initiatives, constructing a value proposition, developing positioning approaches, designing communication programs, use of guerrilla techniques, the roles of price and place, and how to set goals and measure performance.
MGA 60738	Students, in a structured format, are involved in assessing, prioritizing and creatively solving problems encountered by low-income and other disadvantaged South Bend entrepreneurs.  A process consulting approach is employed and a number of useful tools and frameworks are introduced. Students work with both for-profit and non-profit enterprises, producing tangible deliverables that help clients launch, grow and sustain their ventures.
MGA 60750	At a moment when global challenges - from climate change to inclusive development to public health threats - loom large, many nation-states seem unable to come together to address them. In what ways are the world's cities and subnational governments working on their own and in concert to meet these challenges? This course examines the distinctive roles and capacities of cities, provinces, and states in managing global policy issues and explores different modes of trans-local cooperation and coordination. We start by considering the global governance shortcomings of nation-states and exploring the multilevel character of key policy challenges. We next use case studies from different issue-areas to assess how action by subnational governments is contributing to but also complicating solutions. We conclude by discussing the limitations of subnational approaches to global challenges and considering the most appropriate policy roles and portfolios for subnational actors in the 21st century.
MGA 60760	Across the world, millions of citizens live in territories controlled by criminal organizations that co-exist with democratically elected governments. The spread of organized crime across the globe has followed as many countries transitioned to democracy and/or ended long-lasting civil wars. Increasingly, conflict environments feature criminal gangs, drug-traffickers, mafias, and state actors involved in criminal activities. Informed by prominent theories and methodologies in political science, and the social sciences more broadly, this course will examine the causes of organized crime and its consequences or the consolidation of democracy, particularly in countries in Africa and Latin America. Importantly, a core objective of the course is to identify evidence-based policy approaches to address organized crime in developing countries. More specifically, we will examine theories and methodologies in political science, and related fields, that help us address the following six research questions: 1) What countries are the most and least affected by organized crime? 2) What is the role of politics in criminal violence? 3) How does criminal governance differ from other types of governance? 4) How does organized crime interacts with other forms of violence, particularly gender-based violence? 5) In what ways, does organized crime affect democracy? and 6) How have citizens and governments responded to organized crime? In brief, the course will offer an in-depth examination of organized crime and governance through the lens of political science and related fields in the social sciences.
MGA 60761	Global Affairs organizations often manage their work through projects, and project managers are consequently in high demand in the global affairs career marketplace. Project managers write project proposals, design projects, develop project plans, implement project activities, monitor project progress, and evaluate project impact. The PDME course will focus on building these competencies at the project and program levels and will be structured around three existing models: 1) PMD-Pro, an internationally-recognized competency model in global development that also offers a third-party examination and certification; 2) CRS Compass, a model developed by Catholic Relief Services for all global programming that encompasses ideas of Integral Human Development; and 3) MEALD-Pro, similar to PMD-Pro, but with a focus on program monitoring and evaluation.
MGA 60763	What is race? How do concepts of race change according to social, political, and historical context? Do Asian understandings of race differ from those in the West? How are concepts like &quot;blackness&quot; and &quot;white privilege&quot; interpreted in Asia? In this class, we will grapple with this set of questions by looking at how competing definitions of race and nationhood emerged in conjunction with the rise of the Japanese empire (1910-1945), and American military occupation in Asia during the Cold War. Students will investigate how this historical context has continued to affect the ways more contemporary flows of migrants from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa are racialized in Asia, by analyzing sociological, anthropological, and historical texts of everyday life. No prior knowledge about Asian languages or topics is required.
MGA 60764	The new wave of technologies, e.g., robotics and AI will have long-lasting impacts on the labor market. Jobs will be displaced, new tasks will be created, different skills will be demanded, and new management practices will emerge. These new technologies may benefit workers unevenly, potentially increasing inequality. At the same time, new demographic challenges driven by aging will have large impacts on labor. How will these forces affect the future of labor and how should we prepare for changes in the labor market? The goal of this course is to provide students with a framework for analyzing how new technologies like robotics and AI will affect the labor market drawing largely from the economics literature. Students will analyze and describe the literature on these topics and understand the different methodologies used in the literature. Ultimately, students will build perspectives on how AI and robotics could affect jobs, occupations, the future of work, income distribution and social institutions. Students will also build perspectives on education, training, and redistribution policies that can help mitigate the labor market disruptions created by technological change. Students will collect and analyze data that can provide insights on the future of labor.
MGA 60766	This course focuses on the policy and advocacy dimensions of global affairs studies, providing an opportunity for MGA students to explore and strengthen skills for achieving policy impact around a global topic of their choosing. Featuring a required and funded, integrative policy experience in Washington, DC over spring break, students will strengthen their professional networking, stakeholder mapping, policy analysis, and communication skills. Through interactions with government officials, policy experts, international advocacy leaders, as well as representatives of multinational, research, and humanitarian organizations, students will connect theory to practice. Students will examine global policy systems and processes, as well as pathways forward for personal and professional growth and development.  
MGA 60767	Economists used to believe that a certain level of inequality was the price of doing business in a market economy. They presumed that the clever entrepreneur should be rewarded for their ingenuity and ability to create value. Today, however, the world is seeing unprecedented levels of inequality and concentrations of wealth that are distorting markets, undermining democratic institutions, polarizing citizens, and driving increasing unemployment, homelessness and deaths of despair. Such concentrations of wealth have not been seen since the eve of the Great Depression. Suddenly, political leaders and economists are worried. Why? This course will try to answer the following questions: 1) what were the factors that have created the accelerating growth of inequality both domestically and globally?; 2) What are its most significant manifestations and impacts?; 3) And what is or must be done to address the challenges inequality poses both at home and abroad?
MGA 60769	International organizations (IOs) are now ubiquitous actors in world politics. Whether in the realm of security, environmental affairs, health, development, or economics, IOs are involved in coordinating state action and in addressing global problems. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the theory and practice of international organizations. It is focused on three broad questions: First, do international organizations matter? Second, how do they matter, And third, should they matter? The class begins with an overview of how the major perspectives from international relations understand the role, function, and effects of IOs. While considering these questions, students will learn about the inner-workings of major international organizations, including the United Nations, World Bank and IMF, WTO, World Health Organization and others.
MGA 60772	Public policy is usually designed with the assumption that we make optimal choices based on our own best interests. Findings from the behavioral sciences, however, challenge this traditional view and reveal that a wide array of factors influence our decisions. In this course, we will explore the gaps between how we assume individuals to behave and how people actually behave. With better knowledge of what motivates human behavior, we will examine and discuss how policy might be better designed and executed to improve outcomes in society. In this interdisciplinary course, we will hear firsthand from behavioral scientists and learn about their ongoing research programs. In conversations with these invited scholars, we will examine common assumptions behind a variety of existing public policies related to environmental protection, public health, criminal justice, natural hazards, and substance addiction among others.
MGA 60815	The course will compare efforts by humanitarian, development, and peacebuilding communities and actors to articulate professional ethical standards and codes of conduct to guide their work. The course will explore how the distinct mandate and structure of each field of practice shapes the form and substance of ethical norms and practices.  The course will also explore some common ethical issues that organizations working in these fields face, such as the ethics of fundraising and the ethical use of images.  The course will give particular attention to challenges arising when ethical principles and norms are applied in practice.  In addition to scholarly literature, the course will consider first-person narratives of aid workers and other global affairs professionals about ethical challenges they face in their work and case studies of humanitarian, development and peacebuilding action.  Students will be encouraged to consider how various ethical standards discussed in class interact with their own personal and professional values.
MGA 60832	This course introduces students to a range of methodological approaches to generate and gather original data. The course will highlight &quot;best practices&quot; in research design and implementation, but it will also address the logistical constraints and trade-offs that graduate students face while conducting fieldwork. Over the course of the semester, all students will develop multiple strategies to build and evaluate their own research questions.
MGA 60839	This course examines current health policy issues and disease burdens in low-and middle-income countries from an economic perspective. Topics may vary but are likely to include the relationship between health and economic development, child and maternal health, the need for financial risk protection against health shocks, social determinants of health inequities, the control of malaria, the relationship between fetal and early-child conditions on human capital, and other related topics. There will be a strong focus on interpreting the relevant empirical literature. The course will approach these issues from a microeconomics perspective and will analyze economic behavior at the micro-level i.e. individual and household. The course will also discuss program evaluation techniques to understand which health policy works in the real-world.
MGA 60841	We live in an ever-shrinking world in which social, cultural, and economic life is global. People everywhere are aware of the suffering in Syria and the impact of climate change. They want to be part of how cyber space and outer space are regulated. People want to maintain national identity and security, while being able to travel, trade, and connect everywhere. International law is the one means available to all to peacefully achieve a common vision of a better future. It is a system of rules, principles and procedures that regulate activity at the inter-state level. International law is an integral part of contemporary life, effecting issues of war and peace, the global economy, human rights, and the natural environment. International law is a complete system of law, distinctive from national legal systems. The main objective of the course is to provide a comprehensive overview of the system of international law by introducing how international law is made, applied, and enforced. The course will also introduce the major subfields. It will prepare students for both the practice of law and many other careers in the 21st century. The course takes a traditional approach to the study and evaluation of international law, using a classic casebook and end of the semester final exam. Strong or weak class participation is also taken into account. The approach demonstrates that international law is a foundational course in the law curriculum and beyond. It is a required or recommended course for advanced international law courses and is important various moot court competitions, journals, and other co- and extra-curricular activities. International law is a three-credit hour course, meeting two days a week.
MGA 60844	This five-week course will examine forced migration from the perspective of the beliefs, teachings, and programmatic commitments of faith communities. The first week will be devoted to identifying the causes of and global trends in forced migration, as well as the categories of forced migrants. It will also explore the “law of migration”; that is, the diverse legal systems that migrants must negotiate on their journeys and that religious actors use to assess migration policies. The second week will explore the teachings of diverse faith communities on forced migration, their understanding of this immense and growing phenomenon, and their programmatic and policy responses. The third week will segue to state-centered approaches to the governance and management of migration, with a focus on the concepts of sovereignty and the rule of law. It will also consider ideologies such as nativism and exclusionary nationalism that are in tension with the beliefs, policy positions, and programs of religious actors. The fourth week will be devoted to guest speakers and student presentation on situations of protracted displacement throughout the world. Persons in protracted displacement have lived in exile for at least five years and have no viable course out of their “long lasting and intractable status of limbo.” The fifth week will be devoted to US refugee protection trends and policies.
MGA 60845	Feminism isn't only about women, nor is feminism only for women. Feminism is about power - about who has it and who doesn't. And in today's world, data is power. Data can be used to create communities, advance research, and expose injustice. But data can also be used to discriminate, marginalize, and surveil. This course will draw intersectional feminist theory and activism to identify models for challenging existing power differentials in data science, with the aim of using data science methods and tools to work towards justice. Class meetings will be split between discussions of theoretical readings and explorations of data science tools and methods (such as Tableau, RStudio, and Python). Those readings may include chapters from texts that include Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein's Data Feminism (2020), Virginia Eubanks's Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor (2018), Ruha Benjamin's Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code (2019), and Sasha Costanza-Chock's Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need (2020). This course will also examine the data advocacy and activism work undertaken by groups like Our Data Bodies, Data for Black Lives, the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, and Chicago-based Citizens Police Data Project. Over the course of the semester, students will develop original research projects that use data to intervene in issues of inequality and injustice. This course is not about gaining mastery of particular data science tools or methods, therefore familiarity with statistical analysis or data science tools (R, RStudio, Python, etc.) is NOT a prerequisite for this course.
MGA 63996	For better or for worse, work is an inescapable part of life. We all work, regardless of whether it’s doing our taxes, doing the dishes, or disrupting a multi-billion dollar industry. When things go well, work is a source of deep meaning and purpose. When they go poorly, we can experience deep work-related anxiety, stress, and burnout. In this course, we’ll approach all of these philosophical issues -- the good and the bad -- from a perspective of experience and rediscovery. Drawing on some ancient wisdom, fiery historical debates, and exciting new ideas, we’ll ask what it means to be intentional in seeking to flourish at, in, and through our work. With Aristotle, we’ll consider whether true happiness requires the occasional break from work, or perhaps a specific kind of deep work that allows us to get in touch with our contemplative side. With Karl Marx, we’ll consider whether workplace exploitation is inevitable, and develop strategies for responding to it. With Thomas Aquinas, we’ll ask what comes after work, both while we’re here on earth (and in “retirement”) and beyond. And with thinkers as diverse as Hannah Arendt, Dorothy Day, Marcus Aurelius, and even Saint Benedict of Nursia we’ll start to sketch a philosophical guide to work -- and our own philosophies of work -- that will provide a more intentional approach to the greatest goods and biggest obstacles to finding meaning, purpose, and contentment in whatever it is that we define as our “life’s work.”

MGA 75902	This course is for MGA students who are undertaking an internship during the Fall or Spring semester.
MGTO 20000	A study of the management process, including planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling. Emphasis is placed on executive leadership, organizational behavior, and management theory.
MGTO 20100	You were likely born in an organization. Right now you are being taught in an organization. One day you will work in an organization. You will rely on organizations to obtain basic necessities, to participate in activities, and for many facets of life. Organizations emerge because individuals can't or don't want to accomplish their goals alone. This course will explore topics of strategy, networks, culture, teams, motivation, influence, decision making, innovation, and leadership.
MGTO 20300	Strategic management deals with the organization, management, and strategic positioning of the firm so as to gain long-term competitive advantage. Many of your business courses emphasize a specialized, functional perspective of business situations (e.g., marketing, human resources, accounting, finance, operations management). In this course, we integrate these acquired skills by taking the perspective of a general manager (or, equivalently, a management consultant). General managers are responsible for setting the goals, objectives, and strategies of the organizations they lead as well as the implementation and execution of such plans. To do this, managers must be capable of understanding and utilizing the knowledge from each of the organization's functional areas to develop a cohesive and effective competitive strategy. In addition, they must be able to analyze competitive situations within industries in order to understand the sources of the firm's competitive advantage. In today's business environment, whether you are a new hire, consultant, or the CEO, you must be capable of thinking strategically.
MGTO 20700	This course is designed to introduce the central questions of ethics and morality, with a focus on skill-building and ethical leadership. The course includes discussion of theories and concepts that illuminate ethical awareness, knowledge and action to inform problem solving and enhance effectiveness in business. Ethical dilemmas faced by business people are integrated into the class for discussion and analysis, and both philosophical and behavioral approaches to ethical reasoning, decision making and leadership are explored.
MGTO 30110	Our planet, our technology, our society, and our businesses are changing faster than ever. In 1836 Nathan Rothschild, the richest human in the world, died at age 54 from an infection that would be cured today with an antibiotic for less than one dollar. Today's iPhone has 100,000 times the processing power of the Apollo 11 moon landing guidance computer. Our world is progressing, but with that progress comes disruption, dissolution, and obsolescence. The Futuring course prepares students for a rapidly changing world by analyzing major trends and issues impacting business and society in the future. Participants are exposed to a variety of futuring tools and methods employed by professional futurists and strategists. These are applied in a semester-long team project exploring a phenomenon of change of their choosing. Through a process of scenario planning, students cultivate a foresight mindset to examine key uncertainties and create alternative futures. Insights on emerging opportunities are developed along with recommendations on how business can positively influence future change and create resilient strategies to enable success in an uncertain future. 
MGTO 30120	Strategic management deals with the organization, management, and strategic positioning of the firm so as to gain long-term competitive advantage.  Up until this time, most of your business education has emphasized a specialized, functional perspective of business situations (e.g., marketing, human resources, accounting, finance, operations management).  In this course, we integrate these acquired skills by taking the perspective of a general manager (or, equivalently, a management consultant).  General managers are responsible for setting the goals, objectives, and strategies of the organizations they lead as well as the implementation and execution of such plans.  To do this, managers must be capable of understanding and utilizing the knowledge from each of the organization's functional areas to develop a cohesive and effective competitive strategy.  In addition, they must be able to analyze competitive situations within industries in order to understand the sources of the firm's competitive advantage.  In today's business environment, whether you are a new hire, consultant, or the CEO, you must be capable of thinking strategically.
MGTO 30200	Some people find joy and fulfillment in their work while others find it unpleasant and barely tolerable. While many people merely speculate on the factors that affect our work lives, we'll explore solid evidence concerning the key factors that have been found to influence employee attitudes, motivation, and performance. You'll build awareness of interpersonal dynamics, and gain insights into how to manage the behavior of others more effectively.
MGTO 30300	This course provides students the opportunity to interface with leading consulting firms and work as a team to solve business problems. Top firms, like Deloitte, KPMG and EY, give students a realistic job preview by sharing their organization’s culture and process of engaging clients, helping students discern their own career choices and gain practical experience for interviews. Teams compete and solve five cases during the semester by framing key questions to break down the problem, organizing and collecting relevant evidence, and presenting creative feasible solutions to the client. The consulting firm evaluates the proposed solutions for their case and selects a winning team. This class will develop your “corporate street smarts” and allow you to leverage your creative and problem-solving skills. The development and delivery of client-facing presentations also helps individuals hone their communication skills. Finally, in this highly interactive class, students learn the principles of group dynamics and create an impactful deck and action-driven solutions and deliverables.
MGTO 30310	As the challenges and opportunities facing society and businesses grow more complex, and as stakeholders grow more diverse, organizations are increasingly seeking innovative ways to create and capture value. In this course we will explore organization-centered methods of innovation while gaining proficiency in human-centered methods of innovation through an approach known as &quot;design thinking&quot;.    Students will work in teams and consult with a client throughout the semester to apply design thinking - a systematic application of ethnographical research, ideation, prototyping, and customer co-creation - to develop innovations grounded in the client user's current and future needs.
MGTO 30320	International business is conducted with and through people from various cultural backgrounds. Cultural differences, if not understood and bridged, can be significant barriers to the implementation and success of a business venture. We'll learn how to conduct business across borders and cultures by focusing on the cultural, political, economic and legal environments in which multinational corporations (MNCs) operate.
MGTO 30410	Whether you are working for a Fortune 100 company, a dot-com startup, or something in between, it has become increasingly clear that &quot;the people make the place&quot;. We'll learn how organizations acquire, develop, and maintain high-performing employees. We'll examine HR systems from a managerial point of view to help you become informed consumers of practices that affect the quality of life in an organization. This should help you manage your own career and provide useful skills as you progress beyond your initial job placement.
MGTO 30500	This course serves as the foundational course for entrepreneurship minors. Students are introduced to competing definitions of entrepreneurship, its history and role in free market enterprise as an engine of economic growth, wealth creation, and improvement of the human condition; entrepreneurial personality traits and skill sets, and the mechanics of bringing a new product or service to market, including innovation and ideation, technology &quot;push&quot; and market &quot;pull,&quot; disruptive business models, and the elements of feasibility analyses and venture plans.
MGTO 30515	Social Entrepreneurship has sparked dialogue and debate for two decades. Its very definition is much debated, as well as its capacity to create sustainable, scalable, systems-changing impact. This course explores the theoretical concepts, practices and strategies associated with the dynamic discipline of social enterprise and innovation. For our purposes, social entrepreneurship is the landscape, of which paradigm-shifting solutions like microfinance, MSME (Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise) development, bottom of the pyramid, fair trade, impact investing, and the like, are components. This course will study many of these concepts, focusing on their opportunity for social impact, and as a vehicle for wealth creation in vulnerable and disenfranchised communities across the globe. Further, the course covers examples of various social enterprise models (for-profit, non-profit, hybrid), requiring students to analyze and devise strategies to improve the efficacy of these ventures. Finally, the course engages students in research seeking to advance the field of social entrepreneurship at the Keough School of Global Affairs and Notre Dame. 
MGTO 30527	This digital prototyping course will empower students with powerful low code/no code capabilities to fuel entrepreneurial concept development and MVP prototyping in the digital space.  Students will engage with experts from the Notre Dame IDEA Center to gain first-hand experience in next generation solutions for app and digital platform development.  A technical background is not required, but a maker mindset and curiosity for concept development is encouraged.
MGTO 30535	There is a saying: No idea survives first contact with the market. For entrepreneurs, the pathway to early customer adoption relies on connecting with potential customers to test assumptions and validate product-market fit in ways that are very different from the strategies used by brands that are large and established. With an emphasis on digital marketing strategies, the Go To Market course will provide hands-on experience in designing and testing market strategies that can generate real evidence to validate early assumptions and generate the traction necessary for entrepreneurial success.
MGTO 30600	Only a fraction of a manager's communication time and effort is spent on writing, but without question, the most important issues in business end up on paper. This eight-week course will help you to improve your writing, as well as your critical thinking skills. We look at a range of expression issues related to language use, style, tone, grammar, punctuation, and organization. Students will learn to make decisions about document preparation, including format, layout, and design. Students also will develop an understanding of the ethical dimensions of business writing. One cannot become a better writer overnight, but this course can begin the process.
MGTO 30620	A principal challenge for every manager is to determine what sorts of arguments others will find persuasive. Communication is at the heart of what business is about: writing, speaking, and listening are skills that will permit you to succeed. We'll use case studies to examine authentic business problems and we'll offer coaching, feedback, and peer review to develop the skills that executives, customers, employees, shareholders, the press, and the public find so valuable in a professional manager.
MGTO 30623	Communicating for Impact emphasizes effective self-expression: making you better as a writer and speaker so that you can influence others and improve business outcomes. This course will examine your current writing and speaking abilities, provide you with a clear sense of marketplace standards, and give you the tools to improve your writing and speaking. To achieve these objectives, you will read (and we will discuss) textbook chapters about management communication, case studies about authentic business problems, and other current readings. You will write a number of typical business documents, researching business issues. You will work alone, as well as with others on a writing team, and deliver business presentations. Finally, to achieve the goal of becoming a better writer, you will be tested on the communication process through exams based on textbook readings and other materials presented in class.
MGTO 30633	Anita Roddick built the Body Shop on the stories behind her products. Walt Disney told stories that created an immersive experience in magical worlds. Richard Bronson never shied away from telling an unpolished story, knowing that flaws make a story memorable. Among the greatest storytellers of all time, these three understood the power of storytelling to inspire others, drive decision-making, and ignite action, particularly when combined with data and sound logic. This course teaches students the art of clear, effective, and engaging data presentation using storytelling techniques. Delivered in a hands-on, workshop-style format, students build a data story from start to finish focusing on context, visual design, strategic messaging, and persuasive delivery.
MGTO 30670	Crisis communication is the process of &quot;verbal, visual, and/or written interaction between the organization and its publics (often through the news media) prior to, during, and after the negative occurrence.&quot; Organized by the pre-, during, and post-crisis phases, this course explores the strategies for communicating with various stakeholders and the dynamics of managing a crisis in a digital communication era with an integrated crisis communication plan. Students will examine major scholars and crisis resources, and document their understanding of crisis communication through writing assignments and a crisis simulation. Students will recognize the major concepts and theories of crisis communication, be able to list 3-5 scholars relevant to crisis communication, identify best practices for writing crisis messages, and articulate the meaning and practice of crisis communication for various crisis events.
MGTO 30730	In today's interconnected global economy, there is a growing realization that we must restore public trust in business.  Integrating environmental, social, and governance issues into corporate management is the overriding purpose of the United Nations Global Compact and its ten principles.  This is the heart of the corporate sustainability movement.  The objectives of this course are as follows:&lt;br&gt; 1) To introduce the student to the United Nations Global Compact and why its focus on human rights, labor rights, environmental issues, and corruption is so attractive to the many stakeholders of business:&lt;br&gt; 2) To develop the ability to think clearly about how one integrates environmental, social, and governance issues into corporate management:&lt;br&gt; 3) To develop a sensitivity to the moral and ethical values that enable companies to restore public trust in business:&lt;br&gt; 4) To understand how a number of companies are implementing the principles of the Global Compact by examining case studies:&lt;br&gt; 5) To examine and understand the changing role of business in society
MGTO 30740	The idea that people of religious faith ought to bring their religious values into the workplace, that these values ought to influence the quality of life and important decisions in business, is the premise of this course.  Yet what is a good business leader and how does he or she contribute to the common good?  How is work spirituality rooted in religion and can it be dissociated from it?  What does it mean to say that business is a vocation?  What is the Christian understanding of work?  What are potential areas of tension in the business world for a person consciously living a spirituality of work?  These and other questions are the focus of this course.
MGTO 30800	As an Integration course, students successfully completing the class will have fulfilled a University core curriculum requirement. Reflecting an integration of key considerations from the disciplines of Economics and Business Ethics, the course will allow students the opportunity to examine the complexities of climate change, public policy, environmental and social sustainability, and impacts on global economies and communities.  Economics will provide the foundation of knowledge of labor market structure, market failures such as externalities, taxation, migration decisions, discrimination, and income inequality measures.

Attention is devoted to the marketing and communication challenges involved when attempting to do good, and how these issues can be overcome without spending large amounts of money. Sample topics include identifying and understanding target markets for social initiatives, constructing a value proposition, developing positioning approaches, designing communication programs, use of guerrilla techniques, the roles of price and place, and how to set goals and measure performance.
MGTO 40550	Alright, so you think you have an idea for a new venture and are looking to explore the path towards launch. This course will give aspiring founders a first-hand experience in building from an idea into a viable business venture, using the proven best practices used by some of the world's most successful entrepreneurs. We'll learn the first steps one should take that will lead to a successful launch rather than frustration and failure. In this course you will work as a team to define an idea for serving an emerging or unmet market need, work to create and validate a solution to serve this opportunity, and create a business model to justify the investment of resources necessary to launch the venture. Teams will pitch their progress at regular intervals to seasoned professional entrepreneurs and receive direct feedback on the business model fit and viability of the venture. When you finish the course you'll better understand the discovery and validation steps that can lead to successful venture launch.
MGTO 40612	In Applied Impact Consulting (AIC) students work directly with the client to scope projects, manage deliverables, implement solutions, and measure impact. Working as global consultants, students will hone their skills at team building, project management, communication, human-centered design, business model development, and project measurement. Ultimately you will be a part of the team building out an Impact Portfolio to highlight the global impact we as a university are having on the world's most pressing problems. At the end of the semester, teams formally present their projects to an advisory board in an effort to secure any additional funding needed for sustainable implementation. In addition to managing a live consulting project, participants have the opportunity to engage with a number of industry experts both in the classroom and during the class immersions - both domestically and internationally. Students are given first priority for traveling (if they want to travel - travel is not required) as a part of the Innovation &amp; Design Immersion course (MGTO 35310). Students can elect to participate as a team lead (3-credits) or in an analyst role (1.5-credits).
MGTO 40720	Each of us has experienced leaders and organizations who bring out our best selves, and those who leave us less than when we started. In this course, we will explore your experiences as a leader and as a follower, and connect these experiences to the current research on leadership and values in the workplace. Specifically, we will explore how research of the human brain (cognitive neuroscience) and research of human behavior in social and business settings (social psychology, behavioral economics, and management research) illuminates how leaders can effectively engage others beyond self-interest and thus create value for others (pro-social leadership). In other words, how can you lead others to think and act bigger than one's self and one's tribe? How can you uncover shared values where individuals benefit themselves, their colleagues, their organizations, and society? Our class includes developing the skills of empathy, motivating/influencing others, leading change, exploring our biases and blind spots, and creating psychologically safe workplaces that support diversity, inclusion, and belong.
MGTO 41500	Idea Discovery lives at the fuzzy front end of the entrepreneurial spectrum.  It requires creativity and entrepreneurial foresight that enables innovators to, as Steve Jobs once said, &quot;see around corners&quot;.  This course is structured as a lab-format experience in which student teams will conduct multiple exploratory &quot;sprints&quot; to uncover emerging opportunity spaces and imagine conceptual solutions that stretch the boundaries of entrepreneurial thinking.  Along the way, students will be exposed to a range of creative geniuses including Leonardo Da Vinci, Thomas Edison, Buckminster Fuller, Walt Disney and others.

MI 13186	The delight of a naughty tale well-told is a near universal human pleasure - even if it is often a guilty one. In this course, students will discover the Middle Ages from a new perspective as we eschew the frequently austere epic poetry of the aristocratic court sin favor of the enormously popular, commonly comedic, and often lewd short stories that emerged as a distinctive genre in Medieval Europe between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries. We will read a wide range of short tales drawn from English, French, German, and Italian sources, and in so doing will encounter boastful knights, cuckolded lords, defiant ladies, and quarreling couples alongside a dizzying array of bodily functions gone awry and genitalia endowed with the power of speech.   By learning to understand these tales not only as popular entertainment, but also as valuable documents of the anxieties, assumptions, prejudices, and values of the age and cultures in which they were produced and consumed. This will be achieved in part through comparison of the short narrative texts forming the focus of this class with other works of the medieval period, including scholastic debates, sermons, and codes of law, as well as with representations of related themes in the visual arts, including illumination and sculpture. In all this, we will directly address the challenges presented to readers by pre-modern literature and learn how modern scholarship engages with literature through the development and honing of analytical and close reading skills via seminar discussions, comparison of conflicting interpretations by modern scholars, and careful attention to the interaction of form and content.
MI 20001	The Middle Ages have been praised and reviled, romanticized and fantasized. The spectacular popularity of Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, and Narnia have brought a revival of interest in and curiosity about the Middle Ages. But what were they like, these ten centuries between Rome and the Renaissance? In this course, we will explore major themes and issues in medieval civilization in an attempt to offer some basic answers to that question. We will have in view three kinds of people: rulers, lovers, and believers. But we will also study carefully those who wrote about those kinds of people. We will constantly ask how can we know about the Middle Ages, and what kinds of things can we know? We will consider major literary texts as both works of art and historical documents. We will explore various kinds of religious literature. We will try to understand the limits, boundaries, and achievements of philosophy and theology. Some lectures will incorporate medieval art so as to add a visual dimension to our explorations. This course will constitute an extended introduction to the dynamic and fascinating world of the Middle Ages.
MI 20408	The course provides an overview of the variety of the Eastern rite Churches belonging to different cultural traditions of Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean world. The students will be introduced to the theological views and liturgical life of the Eastern rite Christians, i.e., Orthodox, Oriental and Eastern Catholic, and their fascinating history. In the second part of the course we shall explore the Byzantine rite Churches in more detail, and discuss the challenges their theology and history present to the Christian world at large. Special attention will be given to Slavic Christianity and especially Russian and Ukrainian religious history. Reflection on the diversity of Christian traditions will lead to important insights into theological topics of central importance for today such as theology of culture, ecclesiology, sacramental theology and theology of history.
MI 20444	This course offers a theological introduction to the main teachings of the Christian faith, through the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas. Throughout his theology, Aquinas is committed to identifying, proclaiming, and interpreting the principal Christian claims: about the triune God who is beginning and end of all existence; about Christ, who is God become human for the salvation of others; about humans, who are made by and for God, and who through Christ can attain to God as their end. Aquinas is concerned as well to show the overall coherence of the main affirmations about God,  Christ (and his sacraments) and humans. Supplementary readings will be drawn from throughout the theological traditions, both East and West, to confirm and undergird, occasionally challenge, Aquinas in his pursuit of understanding of the Christian faith. Included will be selections from conciliar documents; Augustine; Cyril of Alexandria; Maximus the Confessor; Anselm; Bonaventure; John Calvin; and, Karl Barth and Joseph Ratzinger.
MI 20473	While many Christians have described Islam as a Christian heresy, many Muslims consider Christianity to be an Islamic heresy. Jesus, they maintain, was a Muslim prophet. Like Adam and Abraham before him, like Muhammad after him, he was sent to preach Islam. In this view Islam is the natural religion--eternal, universal, and unchanging. Other religions, including Christianity, arose only when people went astray. Therefore Muslims have long challenged the legitimacy of Christian doctrines that differ from Islam, including the Trinity, the incarnation, the cross, and the new covenant and the church. In this course we will examine Islamic writings, from the Qur'an to contemporary texts, in which these doctrines are challenged. We will then examine the history of Christian responses to these challenges and consider, as theologians, how Christians might approach them today. Regarding the Islamic Challenge to Christian Theology&quot; is the second of two required theology courses at Notre Dame (the &quot;development&quot; course). These two courses are directed towards a number of goals. First, they provide students with information about the Bible and Christian theology that in itself is important. Second, they form the basis of a Catholic community at Notre Dame where all students (whether or not they are practicing Catholics) have a common experience of texts and questions that might be discussed not only in class but while eating mashed potatoes in North Dining Hall. Third, theology itself is meant as a guiding light for all other classes. As with the great European universities (Paris, Bologna, Oxford, Cambridge etc.), Notre Dame was founded by the church to be a community where students are strengthened in their faith and morals, and therefore more able to see the truth in other fields, whether biology, music, or history. Like the first required course (Foundations), Regarding the Islamic Challenge to Christian Theology has the same goals. This is not an Islamic Studies course. It is a course which takes Islam's challenge to Christian teaching as the starting point for Christian theological reflection.
MI 20494	This course traces the development of the dogma of Mary's Immaculate Conception and its theological significance today. The course proceeds in four units. It first explores Christian teaching on Original Sin (the sin from which Mary is believed to have been preserved). It then examines key primary texts (Anselm, Aquinas, Duns Scotus) in the development of the Marian dogma. Third, it focusses on the Marian apparitions in 1858 at Lourdes, which occurred four years after the promulgation of the dogma by Pope Pius IX in 1854. Fourth, it studies the contemporary significance of the dogma for Christian anthropology, ecclesiology, and ecumenism. The teaching on Mary's Immaculate Conception is shown to be interconnected to the Church's beliefs about human nature (creation, Fall, sexuality), Christ, redemption, the sacraments, and sanctification.
MI 20583	The objective of this course is to explore the intricate tapestry of the multiethnic and multicultural Italian peninsula during the Late Middle Ages (12th-15th Centuries) and its interactions with Mediterranean societies. Throughout this course, we will dissect pivotal historical events, cultural and religious exchanges, gender and social issues, geographical implications, and the traditions of the primary populations inhabiting the region. Our journey through this rich history will be guided by Italian authors of short stories, offering us a profound insight into this captivating fusion of civilizations.   During the Late Middle Ages, Italians, particularly Venetians, Pisans, Genoese, and Florentines, reigned as the foremost commercial and naval powerhouses in the Mediterranean. Eminent Tuscan literary figures and intellectuals such as Giovanni Boccaccio, Franco Sacchetti, and Giovanni Sercambi (to name just a few) demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture and expertly convey in their narratives the multifaceted sociological, political, religious, geographical, historical, and psychological  intricacies characterizing this enduring cultural crossroads.  Within the intricate and interconnected Mediterranean environment, the short story indisputably emerged as the most prevalent and esteemed literary genre, transcending cultural and geographic boundaries. This genre encompasses a vast array of themes, meticulously portraying courtly love, chivalric values, the far-reaching impacts of the Crusades, the interplay among the three Monotheistic Religions, the tensions between nobility and bourgeoisie, varying perspectives on women and their societal roles from Spain to the Arabic domains, encounters – and sometimes conflicts – between distinct cultures, pivotal Mediterranean historical events, and the initial ventures into geographical exploration. As our course unfolds, we will discover that these themes represent only a fraction of the myriad facets that the short story has adeptly embraced and narrated for generations of avid readers.
MI 20663	The Thousand and One Nights, also known as the Arabian Nights, is a collection of tales originated in the Arab lands that has become a masterpiece of world literature. These enchanting stories, framed by the tale of Scheherazade (or Shahrazad), have enjoyed a widespread and varied reputation over the centuries and across cultures. It is said that the Thousand and One Nights is the most read (or heard about) book in human history, second only to Bible. In this class, we will examine these stories from a variety of academic and cultural perspectives, taking advantage of the wealth of material available (both textual and audio-visual). We will examine issues of provenance: where did these stories originate and when? We will study the stories as literary texts as well as historical documents, asking what, if anything, they tell us about the cultures they reflect and the societies in which they are set. We will examine how these tales have been interpreted by later societies, both Arab and Western, and what those interpretations tell us about the interpreters. We will use this class and its content to introduce ourselves to the study of the Middle East, its languages, history, literature, and peoples. We will gain a better understanding of the analytical tools and techniques for the study and appreciation of literature in general.
MI 22001	Discussion section accompanying MI 20001.
MI 30201	This course explores the major developments in Byzantium and the Eastern Mediterranean from the time of the crusades and the eastward expansion of the Italian naval powers until the rise of the Ottoman Empire to a new universal power unifying the Balkan Peninsula and Asia Minor under the rule of a Muslim sultanate. The encounter between Latin and Greek Orthodox Christians in the wake of the crusade led to political rivalries and religious discord, culminating in the Latin conquest of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade of 1204. While the eastward expansion of Italian naval powers had already begun in the late eleventh century, it was mainly as a result of 1204 that Venice and, later on, Genoa became predominant political and economic factors in the Eastern Mediterranean, controlling much of the long-distance seaborne trade between Italy and the Syrian coast. The Anatolian Seljuk Turks initiated the gradual Turkification and Islamization of Asia Minor. In the thirteenth century, the Eastern Mediterranean endured increasing pressure from the Mongols and the Mamluk sultanate. One of the results of this development was the rise of the Ottoman principality to a leading political power incorporating large parts of the Balkan Peninsula and, in 1453, the city of Constantinople. We will discuss both socio-economic and political aspects of these developments.
MI 30206	Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived side by side for centuries in the lands surrounding the Mediterranean throughout the Middle Ages - the occupied the same towns, shopped in the same markets, dwelt in the same neighborhoods, read each other's books, and borrowed each other's stories. While covering the broad sweep of Latin-Christian, Islamic, and Byzantine civilizations that grew up in the lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea after the fall of Rome, we will focus especially the on-going interactions between Jews, Christians, and Muslims in this area. While doing so we will constantly ask how can we know - and what kinds of things we can know - about the Middle Ages, as we examine many types of medieval sources, including literary works, historical texts, religious and philosophical writings, and works of art. The course lectures will provide the student with sufficient understanding of the medieval Mediterranean that they will be able to read with profit the assigned texts which are all primary sources, written in a variety of Mediterranean languages, in English translation. The course will proceed partly chronologically - especially when it comes to the politics and geo-politics of the region - and partly thematically.
MI 30244	This course will provide advanced undergraduates and graduate students with a critical introduction to digital humanities for the study of early China, the fountainhead of Chinese Civilization. Collaborating with the Center of Digital Scholarship, this course will focus on relational data with structured information on historical figures, especially high officials, of early Chinese empires. Throughout the semester, we will read academic articles, mine data from primary sources, and employ Gephi and ArcGIS to visualize data. Those constructed data will cover three major themes: how geographical mobility contributed to consolidating a newly unified empire over diversified regions; how social networks served as the hidden social structure channeling the flow of power and talents; and how criminal records and excavated legal statutes shed light on the unique understanding of law and its relationship with the state in Chinese history.
MI 30284	This course will explore modern popular imaginings of the Middle Ages through film. We will view several feature-length films and numerous clips, interspersed with readings from and about the Middle Ages. Together we will discuss and analyze both the texts and films. The films will range from early silent films to Monty Python spoofs to recent blockbusters. I have divided the course into six segments: (1) the Crusades; (2) Eleanor of Aquitaine: wife and mother of kings; (3) Robin Hood; (4) King Arthur; (5) the Black Death; and (6) Joan of ArcStudents will write short daily assignments, two short essays, and a final paper or take-home exam. There are two required textbooks and a course packet. The textbooks are Robert Brent Toplin, Reel History: In Defense of Hollywood (2002); and Daniel Hobbins (trans.), The Trial of Joan of Arc. 
MI 30286	"In <a href=""/search/?p=AD%201095"" data-action=""result-detail"" data-group=""code:AD 1095""  class=""notoffered"">AD 1095</a>, the Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Alexius Comnenus sent a letter to Pope Urban II, asking for succor from Latin Christendom in order to repel the Muslim invaders who were overrunning his empire. Pope Urban II did not merely comply with this request, but transformed it into a call to restore to Christendom the lands of Christianity's origin, which had been lost to Muslim rule in the seventh century. In doing so, Pope Urban inspired and unleashed an outpouring of religious fervor- and bloodshed- unique in the annals of Christian history. This course will be dedicated to the examination of this extraordinary movement, from the initial overwhelming response it aroused among Christians across Europe through the fall of Acre in 1291. Among the issues it will explore are the historical, political, and ideological background to the Crusades, in Byzantium, Europe, and the Islamic world; The Peasants' Crusade and the Children's Crusade; the Latin principalities in the Near East, their organization and societies; interactions between Muslims and Christians; the status and treatment of religious minorities; the legend of Prester John and how it inaugurated the beginning of the European exploration of Central and Eastern Asia; the Italian communes and growth of commerce; the military orders; the career of St. Louis in the Near East; the Ayyubid and Mamluk sultanates and the geopolitical consequences of the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century; and more. Students will spend the second half of the course researching and writing a capstone research paper utilizing primary sources in translation. "
MI 30675	Medieval literature abounds with tales of travel. Celtic, Norse, and British authors created an exciting array of narratives about journeys through far-flung, fantastical, and holy places, and transformative encounters with new people, landscapes, and ideas. While these stories often depict the distant and unfamiliar, they also reveal that which is &quot;close to home,&quot; shedding new light on the identities and beliefs of travelers and audience members alike. In this course we will explore the genre of travel literature through a variety of texts, both sacred and secular (adventure and voyage tales, pilgrimage accounts, sagas, hagiographies, etc.). In our conversations, papers, and, if students choose, creative work, we will analyze the ideas, motifs, and compositional goals that animate these works and examine the implications that they hold, with respect to both the cultures from which they originate, and ourselves as contemporary readers (or vicarious journeyers). We will read both a range of primary literary texts and recent critical essays. Primary texts include the Voyage of St. Brendan, the Welsh Mabinogi, the Vinland Sagas, the Book of Margery Kempe, and the Travels of Sir John Mandeville (all available in modern English, some excerpted). Students will be asked to write two papers (or one paper and one creative project with analytical reflection), take a written exam, and give a presentation, as well as to participate regularly in class discussions.
MI 30715	A survey of Spanish literature through 1700. Readings of selected texts in prose, poetry, and theater from the medieval, Renaissance, and baroque periods.  Recommended prerequisite: ROSP 30310.
MI 33022	In ancient and medieval texts the soul is the principle of life, of sense-perception, emotions, passions, rational thought and ethical behavior. Throughout history, the investigation of the soul has been special in two ways. First of all, we are not addressing an external topic; we are treating ourselves. Secondly, this study of ourselves is not merely meant to describe and analyze, but to change and to form. Ancient philosophers thought of their work as &quot;care of the soul.&quot; The soul is not a mechanism or machine, but something living which can err and go wrong. Pre-modern authorities often described this in the terms of sickness: The body may be sick and need the help of the doctor, and the soul may need therapy if it is sick. In the course, we will address a selection of texts and topics from ancient and medieval sources (Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, Neoplatonic authors and Christian authors from Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages), and compare them with select contemporary texts. What constitutes a healthy soul? What are the sicknesses of the soul? What therapies are recommended? How can one build resilience and how much resilience is right? What role does gender play? 
MI 40005	The course is an intensive survey of Latin scripts from antiquity through the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Students will be able to accurately read and transcribe Latin scripts, expand systems of abbreviation, identify, date, and localize (when possible) different hands, and defend their interpretations. There will be a strong emphasis on the different varieties of Gothic script (textualis, cursiva, hybrida, etc.). Once the class reaches the twelfth century, students will work extensively with Notre Dame¹s medieval collection of 288 manuscripts and fragments. Aspects of practical applications and textual criticism will be addressed at the end of the course. All meetings will be held in the Special Collections Seminar Room.
MI 40109	The Pastoral has been one of the longest-lasting and frequently most prestigious genres (or modes) of poetry in English-language traditions. This course explores how and why poetry that extols the virtues of rural life became so pervasive; how it adapted in the face of changing social, economic, and environmental contexts over more than a thousand years; what problems Pastoral poetry addresses and what problems it causes; how modern and postmodern poets have responded to the Pastoral tradition in a decidedly post-pastoral age; last but not least, what work Pastoral poetry can still do for readers today, and where this genre (or mode) can still do important cultural work.
MI 40202	Why did the Middle Ages produce so many legends, so many stories about gods, heroes, and fantastic events? What do the origins of these stories tell us about medieval European culture and the way it used both writing and the fantastic? What do the differences between different versions of the same story reveal about the stories' audience and composition? Why do some of these stories still resonate powerfully today? These are the kinds of questions we will ask as we survey a range of medieval works representing a variety of literary traditions, including Anglo-Saxon (Beowulf), Norse (the Poetic Edda and Hrolf Kraki's Saga), French (the Song of Roland), Italian (the Inferno), Welsh (the Mabinogion), and Finnish (Kalevala).
MI 40408	In 1965, the Second Vatican Council issued a &quot;Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions&quot;, which contains a statement that Muslims &quot;submit wholeheartedly to even His inscrutable decrees, just as Abraham, with whom the faith of Islam takes pleasure in linking itself, submitted to God.&quot; While the Declaration can be understood as recognizing the possible validity of Islam's claim to Abrahamic status, some scholars have introduced the notion of &quot;Abrahamic religions&quot; as a way of associating Judaism, Christianity and Islam as related faiths. This course will explore the defining features of the Abrahamic religions that tie them closely together as well as their particularities and differences. As the youngest of the three Abrahamic religions, Islam has a lot of things to say about Abraham which largely correspond to the Biblical story although the Qur'an also contains some novel features, including the claim that Abraham, together with Ishmael, built the Ka‘bah. This course will discuss how the scriptures of the three religions emerged within the same cultural milieu, and explore their intertwined histories and the ways in which Jews, Christians, and Muslims developed their own independent religious identities from their early encounters to the present. Students will also be introduced to some basic teachings of Islam. No prior knowledge of Islam is required.
MI 40466	The Eucharist stands at the heart of western European Christianity in the high middle ages. The insistence of church officials on regular reception of the Eucharist; the numerous scholastic treatments of the theoretical issues associated with the Eucharist; the recourse by spiritual authors, especially women, to the Eucharist to express their most profound religious and devotional insights; the pointed reference to the Christ Eucharistically-present to establish Christian identity and to distinguish the members of Christ from others, both within and outside of western Europe; the development of new rituals focussed on aspects of the Eucharist; the burgeoning of artistic representations of Eucharistic themes—all testify to the centrality of the Eucharist in medieval theological and religious consciousness. Through the close reading of representative texts by a wide variety of 13th-century authors, and the study of the different kinds of 'Eucharistic' art, this course examines the uses made of the Eucharist by a broad spectrum of high medieval Christians. A special concern of the course is the relation between Eucharistic doctrine and religious practice—to what extent have teachings about transubstantiation and real presence shaped religious expression? How has religious experience itself occasioned the refinement of these doctrines?
MI 40553	An in-depth study, over two semesters, of the entire &lt;i&gt;Comedy&lt;/i&gt;, in its historical, philosophical and literary context, with selected readings from the minor works (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Vita Nuova, Convivio, De vulgari eloquentia&lt;/i&gt;). Lectures and discussion in English; the text will be read in the original with facing-page translation. Students may take one semester or both, in either order.
MI 40632	The aim of this course is to experience a broad spectrum of Medieval Latin texts.  Readings representative of a variety of genres (literary and subliterary), eras, and regions will be selected. Students planning to enroll in this course should be completing Introduction to Christian Latin Texts or they must secure the permission of the instructor.
MI 40766	This class explores medieval representations of scientific ideas and mythological stories.
MI 40801	A reading of Augustine’s Confessions, partly in Latin and in its entirety in English, with a special emphasis on close reading and precise grammatical and stylistic analysis. We will focus on understanding Confessions as a work of Latin literature and Christian philosophy, part of the great late ancient endeavor to develop new genres and styles to mirror the new belief system, yet connected to the classical world in multiple ways. In addition to the narrative itself, Augustine’s personal experience, Confessions allows the reader to gain insight into his major philosophical tenets and the conversations and controversies of his life. We will also discuss important scholarly questions (origin, historical setting, sources and parallels, biblical framework, structure, philosophical background, modern readings, etc.) and read selections of scholarly literature.
MI 45999	This internship provides students with the opportunity to gain real world experience in the organization, management, and teaching of a Medieval Studies course for advanced High School seniors. Students will assist in running the Medieval Institute's class at Adams High School in South Bend, meeting with the course instructor on a weekly basis to plan future lessons, reviewing and evaluating classwork from the Adams students, and leading class discussions once per week. The culmination of the semester will see the student write a post for the Medieval Institute's Medieval Studies Research Blog evaluating the course design and instructional format, assessing student learning based on evidence from weekly responses, considering the impact of this public humanities initiative for both the high school and the university and reflecting upon their own learning outcomes. 
MI 46020	Offers advanced undergraduate students a possibility to work closely with a professor in preparing a topic mutually agreed upon.

MI 58002	This course is part of a two-semester sequence open only to seniors in the Medieval Studies honors program who have completed MI 58001 successfully. Guided by a faculty adviser, students will use the research completed in the fall to write drafts and a final version of their senior honors thesis. Specific deadlines and requirements for the written stages of the thesis are available from the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
MI 60005	The course is an intensive survey of Latin scripts from antiquity through the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Students will be able to accurately read and transcribe Latin scripts, expand systems of abbreviation, identify, date, and localize (when possible) different hands, and defend their interpretations.

This course will explore the defining features of the Abrahamic religions that tie them closely together as well as their particularities and differences. As the youngest of the three Abrahamic religions, Islam has a lot of things to say about Abraham which largely correspond to the Biblical story although the Qur'an also contains some novel features, including the claim that Abraham, together with Ishmael, built the Ka‘bah. This course will discuss how the scriptures of the three religions emerged within the same cultural milieu, and explore their intertwined histories and the ways in which Jews, Christians, and Muslims developed their own independent religious identities from their early encounters to the present. Students will also be introduced to some basic teachings of Islam. No prior knowledge of Islam is required.
MI 60422	Athanasius of Alexandria and Gregory of Nyssa were two of the most influential expositors of Nicene Trinitarian theology. Apart from their defenses of the full divinity of the Son and the Spirit, both wrote broadly in a variety of theological genres (apologetics, biblical exegesis, doctrinal exposition, spiritual guidance) and dealt with a wide great range of theological topics (Trinity, Christology, theological anthropology, etc.). Some scholars see a clear influence of Athanasius on Gregory and some deny any such influence. This course will examine the major writings of both theologians, examining their theological content, literary construction, and historical contexts. We will also compare their respective writings, both in order to appreciate the different expressions of their common fidelity to Nicene doctrine and to engage the question of possible textual dependence.
MI 60466	The Eucharist stands at the heart of western European Christianity in the high middle ages. The insistence of church officials on regular reception of the Eucharist; the numerous scholastic treatments of the theoretical issues associated with the Eucharist; the recourse by spiritual authors, especially women, to the Eucharist to express their most profound religious and devotional insights; the pointed reference to the Christ Eucharistically-present to establish Christian identity and to distinguish the members of Christ from others, both within and outside of western Europe; the development of new rituals focussed on aspects of the Eucharist; the burgeoning of artistic representations of Eucharistic themes all testify to the centrality of the Eucharist in medieval theological and religious consciousness. Through the close reading of representative texts by a wide variety of 13th-century authors, and, the study of the different kinds of 'Eucharistic' art, this course examines the uses made of the Eucharist by a broad spectrum of high medieval Christians. A special concern of the course is the relation between Eucharistic doctrine and religious practice -to what extent have teachings about transubstantiation and real presence shaped religious expression? How has religious experience itself occasioned the refinement of these doctrines?
MI 60553	An in-depth study, over two semesters, of the entire Comedy, in its historical, philosophical and literary context, with selected readings from the minor works (e.g., Vita Nuova, Convivio, De vulgari eloquentia). Lectures and discussion in English; the text will be read in the original with facing-page translation. Students may take one semester or both, in either order.
MI 60632	The aim of this course is to experience a broad spectrum of Medieval Latin texts.  Readings representative of a variety of genres (literary and subliterary), eras, and regions will be selected. Students planning to enroll in this course should be completing Introduction to Christian Latin Texts or they must secure the permission of the instructor.  Those with interests in particular text types should inform the instructor well in advance so that he can try to accommodate their interests.
MI 60675	One of the most popular genres of medieval literature was the travel tale, and Celtic, Norse and British authors created an exciting range of stories about far-flung, fantastical , and holy or heavenly places, and the experiences of quite normal people in these often really abnormal places. While these texts generally stage transformations, meetings, and confrontations with new peoples, landscapes and ideas at geographically remote sites, the narratives typically lead audience members to reflect on issues of identity and belief that are actually very close to home. Analyzing the role of travel and visits to different worlds across several types of texts (legendary histories and origin accounts, hagiographies, adventure and voyage tales, sagas, pilgrimage accounts, etc.) we will identify several of the universal attributes, styles, compositional goals and motifs found in travel literature. We will also explore the differences between, for instance, secular and sacred travel tales, with particular attention to the role of the audience, the reader who undertakes an imaginative, textual journey by turning a books pages or listening to a tales? oral performance. Participants will read both primary literary texts (all available in English translation), as well as a number of critical essays. Primary texts (some excerpted) may include but are not limited to Lebor Gabála Érenn (Book of Invasions of Ireland), Acallam na Senórach (Colloquy of the Ancients), Navigatio Brendani (Voyage of St. Brendan), Irish immrama (voyage tales), the Prologue to Snorri Sturlusons? Gylfaginning (Fooling of Gylfi), the Norse Vínland sagas, Geoffrey of Monmouths? Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain), the Welsh Mabinogi, the Travels of Sir John Mandeville, and a pilgrimage account (TBD).
MI 60801	A reading of Augustine’s Confessions, partly in Latin and in its entirety in English, with a special emphasis on close reading and precise grammatical and stylistic analysis. We will focus on understanding Confessions as a work of Latin literature and Christian philosophy, part of the great late ancient endeavor to develop new genres and styles to mirror the new belief system, yet connected to the classical world in multiple ways. In addition to the narrative itself, Augustine’s personal experience, Confessions allows the reader to gain insight into his major philosophical tenets and the conversations and controversies of his life. We will also discuss important scholarly questions (origin, historical setting, sources and parallels, biblical framework, structure, philosophical background, modern readings, etc.) and read selections of scholarly literature.
MI 63467	The purpose of this seminar is to examine the various sacramental rites in the Middle Ages, especially the Eucharistic liturgy, and to attempt to reconstruct them within the context of liturgical enactment, architectural space, artistic and musical decoration, etc. The seminar must necessarily deal with liturgical texts, but this is only a first step for understanding the broader dimensions of the liturgy. Architectural, artistic and musical components will be taken into consideration. Numerous commentaries on the liturgy are also an important source for garnering the medieval understanding of the liturgy, especially in its allegorical interpretation. A tangential but key element for the understanding is the devotional and spiritual practices that grew up alongside the official liturgy. Therefore, some attention will be given to these dimensions, including liturgical drama.
MI 63590	This graduate seminar, taught in English, explores the forms, functions, and stakes of a pervasive literary form in French and Occitan literatures from ca. 1150 to ca. 1500: debate literature. From the university classroom to the courtroom and from idyllic orchards to battlefields, debates offered a heuristic for participants and listeners to engage in controversy, put their virtuosity on display, and spark continued reflection on the relationship between self and thought. With a focus on courtly literature, we will examine how debates were set up, performed, and judged, teasing out some of the recurring stakes of this literary tradition. The ability to read in French is necessary, although English translations will be made available where possible.

MI 80367	A distinctive feature of premodern philosophy and science is the organization of nature, reasoning, and methods into elements. Philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians in the premodern world conceived of elements of reasoning as they developed axiomatic methods of demonstration and argumentation. Perhaps the most famous example of this kind of reasoning is Euclid’s Elements, but other ancient and medieval philosophers composed works in elemental modes and formulated axiomatic methods (sometimes known as demonstrating in more geometrico or a geometrical way) to study metaphysics and nature. Proclus’s Elements of Theology are a foundational and paradigmatic text in this tradition (and to a lesser extent so too is his shorter Elements of Physics). This course is centered on a close examination of Proclus’s Elements of Theology but will also study selections in this premodern tradition, including Porphyry’s Sententiae, and Cusanus’s De non aliud, as well as Boethius’s De Hebdomadibus and the Liber de causis, along with their respective commentaries by Thomas Aquinas.  No prerequisites are required for the course, but familiarity with ancient and medieval philosophy would be useful. Students will be invited to read texts in translations and in their original language. No knowledge of ancient languages (Greek and Latin) is required nor of other modern languages (e.g., Italian, French, German) but some linguistic training in these languages would be beneficial.
MI 80401	This course reviews and reinforces the basics of Syriac grammar and guides students through texts from the third through the thirteenth centuries. These texts are organized around questions of genre and theme and with the aim of helping students navigate the variety of styles, scripts, and print media encountered in the study of Syriac theology.
MI 83488	The conversion of Slavic peoples to Christianity marked a decisive moment in the Christianization of Europe and the inculturation of Christianity beyond the romanitas of the Latin and Byzantine worlds. Today, Slavs make up the largest percentage of Christians in the Orthodox Church, and recent studies reveal Slavic countries to range from among the least religious (e.g. Czech Republic) to the most religious (e.g. Poland) Roman Catholic countries in Europe. This doctoral seminar will engage and encourage new research on Slavic religious practice from the Middle Ages to today. Significant investigation will be conducted on the earliest Glagolitic heritage, which offers new insights into unique medieval Slavic liturgical practices at the crossroads of eastern and western traditions. Other topics include the relationship between liturgy and national identity in the past and present; the complex and varied medieval attitudes toward inculturation and the vernacular; liturgical praxis during periods of oppression and/or persecution (i.e. Ottoman period, communist regimes, etc.); and examples of liturgical renewal movements, theological renaissances and religious debates within various Slavic societies today.
MI 88001	Independent research and writing on an approved subject under the direction of a faculty member.
MI 88002	Required of nonresident graduate students who are completing their theses in absentia and who wish to retain their degree status.
MI 93287	Historiography is one of the primary genres of Byzantine literature. No doubt, authors like Michael Psellos, Anna Komnene, or Niketas Choniates count among the most accomplished historians of the medieval Mediterranean world, being read and appreciated far beyond the field of Byzantine studies. The late antique genres of secular political and ecclesiastical history writing persisted, merged, and developed in various forms throughout the Byzantine millennium and found continuators even after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. We thus have an almost unbroken sequence of historical works providing the essential information for all significant developments in the empire’s political affairs. However, historical narratives were not confined to these texts. They can be found in many other genres of Byzantine literature, such as encomiastic speeches and poems, letters, saints’ lives, foundation charters of monasteries, and legal documents. All these text types significantly deepen our understanding of Byzantine historical thought.  This course explores how the Byzantines thought about and made sense of their past in different periods and historical circumstances. It focuses on authors and their social and intellectual environment on the one hand and problems of source criticism on the other. Thus, we will discuss the socioeconomic circumstances in which historical narratives were produced and the living conditions and experiences that shaped approaches to and perceptions of historical events and actors. Analyzing literary conventions, rhetorical devices, and historical concepts will lead us to possible ways of deciphering modes of expression and uncovering underlying realities. This course invites not only advanced students of Byzantium but also those who would like to learn more about Byzantium and the Eastern Mediterranean through some of its most appreciated primary sources in modern translations.
MI 93366	An in-depth investigation into three competing medieval theories of intellect, from Avicenna (Ibn Sina), Averroes (Ibn Rushd), and Thomas Aquinas. These are three of the most important medieval noetic systems, which adapt Aristotelian and Neo-Platonic views within the Islamic and Christian traditions and which shape influential debates into later medieval and Renaissance philosophy. Readings include Avicenna's Psychology of The Cure; Averroes' Long Commentary on De Anima; Aquinas's De Unitate Intellectus; and important secondary scholarship.

MSSA 60800	The course is designed to provide MSBA Sports Analytics students with the tools to manage their career throughout their lifetime. It not only addresses the planning process necessary to start the job search, but also incorporates specific assistance in such areas as resume writing, interview preparation and skills, networking and other tactics.
MSSA 60850	This course is the capstone for the program and provides an intensive integrative experience while students work with one or more industry partners. Students will be presented with a real business problem and access to relevant data, and will need to develop a thorough understanding of the problem and the associated data, then develop and execute a project work plan that analyzes the data available, develops actionable recommendations, and provides insight into the basis for those recommendations. Skills developed include the ability to provide effective communication of analytics results, and an understanding of key aspects of analytics solution deployment.
MSSA 70340	With the continued disruption of consumer attention caused by changes in technology, understanding how to navigate multi-channel marketing tactics, personalization, privacy and tracking methods is more important than ever. Students will learn to identify and attract desirable audiences and provide them with the appropriate experience to drive engagement and firm value. We will examine the strategies and analytics of customers moving through a typical marketing funnel via different devices, platforms, and stages and learn to apply the correct targeted tactics based on data during the different stages — acquisition, engagement, conversion and retention. Social, search, content and conversion analytics will be explored and applied to maximize the customer value utilizing different tools such as Google Analytics, Customer Data Platforms, Content Recommenders and Data Management Platforms.
MSSA 70530	Cloud computing is a transformative force in the development of technology solutions that meet business analytics needs. Firms no longer need to make significant capital investments in large-scale data centers that sit idle for extended periods of time. The cloud model offers flexible, scalable, and cost-efficient access to computing resources on a just-in-time basis. In this course, we will explore the applications of cloud computing to common business analytics problems. We will explore full-stack cloud solutions, including the use of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) technologies.
MSSA 70750	Digital disruption is reshaping entire industries in today's global economy. In this dynamic environment, organizations must be agile and innovate with emerging technologies to generate new value propositions. Using the concept of &quot;macro technology forces,&quot; we will explore how the past, present, and future of IT innovation tends to follow the same three-tiered architecture over the past 160 years: Computation, Information, and Interaction. This course will provide you with a frame of reference, or lens, to apply to business problems that will help you think about ways that firms can be digitally transformed.
MUS 10090	An introduction to the materials and structure of Western tonal art music, including pitch, rhythm, meter, scales and keys, intervals, chords, harmonic progressions and voice-leading, and form.
MUS 10131	A music appreciation course requiring no musical background and no prerequisites. General coverage of the significant musicians, styles, and structures of jazz music.
MUS 10140	This course offers an introduction to ethnomusicology. We will explore its development and research methods, focusing on the &quot;big questions&quot; asked by ethnomusicologists:  How might we define and refine our understanding of musical sound(s)? What are the shared and unique building blocks of expression in different kinds of musics? How do these musics differ across time and space, and what can musical practice teach us about any given society? Approaching these questions thematically and geographically, students will not only encounter numerous musical systems and cultures worldwide, but also be encouraged to rethink their own relationships with music. Coursework will include completing an ethnographic project as well as attending concerts and workshops with practitioners of various musical traditions (such as Indonesian gamelan, Afro-Cuban drumming, Middle Eastern maqam-based performance, Indian dance, etc.).
MUS 10150	A study of the music composed for the Mass, the Office hours (primarily Vespers), and the Requiem Mass from the Middle Ages to the present day. The musical repertoire of each era is examined both from a purely musical standpoint and in light of the reactions of various popes, from John XXIII through Pius X, to the sacred music of their day. Documents on sacred music issued after Vatican II also are examined in relation to postconciliar church music for both the choir and the congregation.
MUS 10160	Imagine that you wake up one morning before a big game, only to realize you’ve been transformed into a giant insect, unable to roll out of bed. Or imagine that two strangers come to your dorm room to notify you that you are under arrest, but you’ll still be allowed to attend classes as usual. Or imagine that your student status has been erroneously revoked, but every time you try to schedule a meeting with the registrar to fix the mistake, you are denied because appointments are only for registered students.   This course explores the “Kafkaesque”—the nightmarish, inscrutable, darkly comedic realm described in the writings of Franz Kafka (1883-1924). Born in Prague, Kafka was trained as a lawyer and worked for an insurance agency while writing prolifically in his spare time. His influential novels and short stories (which he intended to be burned upon his death) later earned him the epithet “the Dante of the 20th Century.” We will enter into Kafka’s world of grotesque transformations, absurd reactions, and abject failures in order to reflect on the Kafkaesque ways of knowing the modern condition that we recognize and encounter today: infinite spools of red tape, increasingly cryptic communications, appearances that are not as they seem.   Starting with some of Kafka’s classics (e.g. Metamorphosis, The Trial) as well as lesser-known pieces (e.g. “In the Penal Colony,” “A Country Doctor”), we will also consider other writers, artists, filmmakers, and composers who have been inspired by Kafka and the Kafkaesque, ranging from opera to K-pop, from radio to virtual reality, from Us to The Fly. We will take a field trip into Chicago to explore how contemporary playwrights and musicians have internalized the Kafkaesque. The various modalities of course work will include shorter blog posts and discussion threads as well as research papers and creative projects.

MUS 43160	This course will explore how music and sound have become central to modern multi-media. While our main focus will be on movies (ranging from classical to contemporary cinema, presented in mandatory weekly screenings), we will also explore the role of music and sound more broadly from advertisements to video-games; from music videos to TikTok clips; from ambient sound in retail spaces to personalized playlists. In doing so, readings will cover various topics and issues aesthetic and psychological (such as representation, narration, emotion); social and political (such as race, ethnicity, propaganda); cultural and economic (such as production, technology, dissemination), and music-analytical (such as style, syntax, harmony, topoi, genre).  Course work will include discussion posts, position papers, and a capstone research project that may involve creative work.
MUS 48390	One full-length (one hour) or two half-length (30 min.) recitals required for all performance majors.  An additional full length recital required for honors.
MUS 48900	Music history and theory majors in the honors program must write a senior thesis. They will be assigned an advisor with whom they will work.
MUS 50021	An exploration of music ranging from Bach and Handel; to Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven; and beyond to Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms among others, through hands-on analysis of great solo, chamber, orchestral, and concerto compositions. Our interaction with the repertoire will be holistic, with light cast on the contribution of thematic design, key scheme, and large-scale harmonic pillars to the articulation of musical form. The focus will be on the main formal types characteristic throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: basic phrase types (the period and sentence); binary and rounded binary; theme and variations; ternary and compound ternary; rondo; sonata and sonata-rondo forms; and the concerto. Much of the course will address the music itself, but it will also include readings from secondary sources, which will provide background on the relevant analytical methodologies. A special component will be the opportunity to attend select presentations at a conference on the concerto in the nineteenth century at Notre Dame on April 5–6. Course work will include weekly listening and score study, readings from the secondary literature, written analysis assignments, and a final exam.

The purpose of the class is threefold: first, to orient students to the basic genetic principles necessary for the understanding of hereditary influences on development; secondly, to overview genetic and environmental influence on behavioral, biomedical, and bio-behavioral attributes; and, lastly, to assist students to realize that behavioral genetics is a powerful tool for the study of environmental as well as genetic influences on development.
NSBH 30520	An &quot;Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience&quot; is a survey course that introduces students to the biological substrates underlying various forms of cognition in humans, with a specific focus on mental processes. We will explore how psychological and cognitive functions are produced by the brain. Cognitive neuroscience is a branch of both psychology and neuroscience, drawing from disciplines such as biological psychology (biopsychology), neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and neuropsychology.We will cover a broad range of topics, including learning and memory, perception, development and neural plasticity, cerebral lateralization and language, emotions and social cognition, stress, sleep and dreaming, and consciousness. No previous coursework in neuroscience is required, but at least some experience with biology or biopsychology is preferred.
NSBH 33528	The global population is aging, and there is increasing importance to understand how cognition is affected as we age. In this course, you will learn about the current theories and controversies about how cognition changes during healthy aging and in aging associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. The key areas of cognition you will explore include attention, executive function, processing speed, and learning and memory. You will also explore the relationship between brain and cognitive aging, and factors that that potentially mediate risk of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. 
NSBH 36500	This is the first of three courses that are designed for Neuroscience and Behavior (NSBH) students accepted into the Honors program. Registration is by permission only.

PCAY 00606	Ever since Star Wars hit cinemas in 1976, science fiction and special effects extravaganzas have dominated the silver screen, such that it sometimes seems hard to release any other type of movie. In the twenty-first century, there seems little chance that such movies will relinquish their grip on the market any time soon. Big franchises (Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Star Trek, etc.), dominate, but other one-offs also slip through.In this course, students will be asked to look at the various ways in which the science fiction movie manifests itself in the current market, through ten movies that represent the state of the field. Students will be asked to respond to the movies, and engage with critical writings on them.
PCAY 00610	The course objectives are twofold: 1) introducing class to the study of philosophy; 2) approaching some authors in a systematic manner, by underlining how each of them dealt with the raising of the theoretical notions of wonder, cause, and science.  The course will examine the development of the concepts of wonder, cause, and science, reflecting upon how the main Ancient Greek philosophers tackled these themes at their time. Moreover, it will be considered how these notions were dealt with throughout the history of thought. Lessons will be divided into three parts: the first will be an introduction to the main Ancient Greek philosophers (Thales, Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle). Therefore, initial lessons will be about the contextualization of the rise of philosophy and exploring the core of the first authors’ thoughts. Later lectures will focus on the theme of the birth of philosophy and the concept of wonder. From a historical point of view, Plato’s and Aristotle’s ideas about wonder as the principle of philosophy will be considered. In fact, according to both authors, philosophy begins in wonder. From a theoretical point of view, the concept of wonder will be defined and explored starting from the assumption that it is the children’s way of looking at the world and asking their whys. The last part of the course will focus on the theme of causality as the fundamental notion of scientific thought. According to Aristotle, in fact, understanding is knowledge of causes. This is, still today, the basic foundation of scientific thought. In this sense, the beginning of the scientific attitude will be reconstructed, highlighting the heritage this perspective left also to the contemporary approach to systematic sciences.

"
PHIL 10111	"Should you practice a religion?  What do you owe other people?  What would it take for your life to be meaningful? And how should you decide what to believe when it comes to big questions like these?  In God and the Good Life, we're searching for answers. We'll read the best philosophical arguments addressing these questions.  We'll share our reactions to the proposals in blogs and social media editorials.  We'll come together as a large group to debate real world case studies that bear on these questions, hearing periodically from guest speakers making headlines in current debates about religion, morality and meaning.  And we'll meet in small Sustained Dialogue groups to discuss our religious and moral identities and develop virtuous friendships (to borrow Aristotle's terminology).  If you are excited about developing philosophical skills in an intense, creative community format---this is the course for you.  This course fulfills the first philosophy requirement.  Learn more about GGL at our course website: godandgoodlife.org.  Or watch our course trailer: <a href=""https://youtu.be/EMKbtSC3-2I"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/EMKbtSC3-2I</a>"
PHIL 12111	GGL students are required to enroll in (and actively participate in) a weekly Sustained Dialogue group. These groups meet weekly on Tues or Weds evening from 8:00-9:00pm. Groups will be created the first week of the semester, based on students' interests and philosophical background. You must be available from 8:00-9:00pm on the night of the section you register for. A portion of your GGL grade will be determined by the quality of your work in your SD group.
PHIL 13185	A general introduction to philosophy, taught in a seminar format, with emphasis on perennial problems such as the existence of God, human freedom, and moral obligation. The course is also intended to sharpen the student's skills of critical thinking.

PHIL 20255	"Work plays a deeply important role in our lives. Finding good work -- which, for many of us, means getting a meaningful job you're passionate about -- can seem like the crucial factor in determining whether your life goes well or poorly, and whether you end up happy and fulfilled or miserable and empty. But things aren't nearly so simple. What kind of work is available to anyone in particular is largely determined by factors outside of our control. And when it comes to work, we're notoriously bad at predicting what aspects of a job we'll find meaningful and fulfilling, and which will drain us of life and energy. In this course, we will focus on the most urgent questions facing anyone trying to discern what their life's work will be, such as:  -	What causes alienation, anxiety, and burnout at work, and are these things that can be avoided with foresight and careful planning? -	What is &quot;leisure&quot; (as contrasted with &quot;time off&quot;) and what role should it play if we want to be healthy, flourishing persons? Is there such a thing as &quot;work-life balance&quot;? -	Do we live in a genuine meritocracy? And, if so, is this a good thing or a bad thing? How should we think about equity and equality in the workplace? -	Is it dangerous (or perhaps wise) to see your work purely as an instrument of financial gain? Does work have the power to nurture (or destroy) your soul?  The course will be organized by topic, and we'll read a broad range of thinkers from St. Benedict to Karl Marx and Max Weber to more contemporary thinkers like Alasdair MacIntyre, Michael Sandel, and David Graeber (author of the provocative book &quot;Bullshit Jobs&quot;).  We'll also watch a lot of the TV show &quot; Survivor.&quot;  Students will leave the course with their own &quot;philosophy of work,&quot; captured in a living document that details their core beliefs about the role of work in living a good life."
PHIL 20408	This course explores theoretical and practical issues arising in law. Topics will include some of the following: laws regulating speech; drug laws, the limits of the criminal sanction, and the debate about over-criminalization; self-defense; the foundations of criminal procedure.  In class mid-term and short paper for each of the 3 class units.  Regular attendance and participation in required Friday class discussion section. 
PHIL 20409	This course will focus on the writings of Black political thinkers in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. Through critical examination of the conditions against, and contexts within, which the political theories of these thinkers are situated, this course hopes to arrive at some understanding of the principles, goals, and strategies developed to contest and redefine notions/concepts of citizenship (vis-a-vis the imperatives of race/racism and the global colonial formations), humanity, justice, equality, development, democracy, and freedom.
PHIL 20412	Philosophical exploration of ethical issues involved in data science. 
PHIL 20414	In this course, we will examine the philosophical ideas of Karl Marx, including his views on work, human nature, and freedom. We will focus on reading primary texts, from Marx's early manuscripts to excerpts from Capital. Additional readings will include philosophical responses to Marx's ideas from other thinkers.
PHIL 20443	A critical introduction to attempts to understand rationality and rational decision-making, including the way that moral considerations enter into those deliberations. Topics may include: utility-maximization theory, introductory game theory, consequentialism, deontic reasoning, and the function of the good in practical reason, as well as the limitations of rationality.
PHIL 20454	"How does philosophical reasoning interact with lived practice? What is the relationship between a philosopher's metaphysical views and their ethical commitments? Can philosophy help you live a better life? In this course, we will look at a range of ancient and contemporary positions on questions like these. We will seek to understand a number of historical approaches to the philosophical life not only through in-depth reading and discussion of texts from the philosophical traditions in question, but also by trying out each tradition's distinctive practices for ourselves.  The specific topics and philosophical traditions covered are subject to change. For the most up-to-date information, see the course description at <a href=""https://philosophy.nd.edu/courses/2nd-courses-in-philosophy/"" target=""_blank"">https://philosophy.nd.edu/courses/2nd-courses-in-philosophy/</a>"
PHIL 20601	Measurement is a fundamental activity in modern science, both the natural and social sciences. While measurement is often considered as the hallmark of science that makes an activity “scientific,” there is little consensus among philosophers about how to define measurement, what kinds of things are measurable, or which conditions make measurement possible. By engaging with texts that build on concrete practices of measurement in historical and contemporary case studies, we will collectively explore questions such as: How do we know that an instrument, such as a thermometer, measures the quantity it is intended to measure? How are measurement units established, and how do they vary across different fields of science and culture? What does it mean to measure human attributes, such as feeling, if possible at all? Our journey begins with in-depth discussions on accuracy and precision, calibration, and standardization—the foundational concepts that make measurement possible. We then navigate the diverse landscape of philosophical viewpoints on measurement, encompassing operationalism, conventionalism, and realism. With these concepts and perspectives in mind, we will explore more case studies across various scientific domains, ranging from the physical and biological sciences to clinical medicine and social sciences, where you will discover issues more closely related to your own field of study. In the course, you will bring and elaborate your own case study related to your specific interests or fields of study. This case study serves as a focal point for actively applying concepts and approaches learned throughout the course, which will eventually crystallize into your final paper. From the course, you will come to see measurement not merely as a technical process but as a complex epistemic activity that demands critical examination, from experimental design to data interpretation. No prior background in specialized sciences is necessary to enroll in this course.
PHIL 20613	We shall study the philosophy of computability, following various philosophical issues and debates through history to contemporary times. Turing’s seminal 1936 paper greatly clarified the meaning of computability, introducing Turing machines, the halting problem, universal computers, and the concept of computable real numbers. His resolution of the Entsheidungsproblem provided a simple computability-based proof of the Gödel incompleteness phenomenon, challenging Hilbert’s program. His ideas on oracle computation lead to the hierarchy of Turing degrees, and the hierarchy of computational complexity similarly grows out of the P vs NP problem. Kolmogorov complexity reveals inherent limitations of our ability to gauge computational difficulty. The latter part of the course will focus on the philosophy of artificial intelligence, from classical treatments of the Turing test to the astonishing contemporary developments in artificial intelligence, which we shall explore with various student experiments using the latest AI services.
PHIL 20617	"Critical survey of selected topics, themes, positions, and arguments in the philosophy of science. Content varies by semester. For current semester, see <a href=""https://philosophy.nd.edu/courses/2nd-courses-in-philosophy/"" target=""_blank"">https://philosophy.nd.edu/courses/2nd-courses-in-philosophy/</a>."
PHIL 20801	"This course will examine principal questions in the philosophy of religion relating to the nature and existence of God, religious beliefs, religious experience, divine hiddenness, religious pluralism and exclusivism, immortality, the relationship between God and ethics, and other questions. For details about specific sections in a particular semester, see <a href=""https://philosophy.nd.edu/courses/2nd-courses-in-philosophy/"" target=""_blank"">https://philosophy.nd.edu/courses/2nd-courses-in-philosophy/</a>. "
PHIL 20804	The primary goal of the course is to introduce students to some of the central thinkers and historical controversies animating the French intellectual scene between the Reformation and the height of the enlightenment in the eighteenth century. Central authors include Montaigne, Descartes, and Pascal; topics to be addressed include skepticism, natural philosophy, and rationalism, and the relationship of these to questions of morals, culture, and religious belief, including divine grace and the role of religious institutions. 
PHIL 20806	From the beginning of the Abrahamic faiths and of Greek philosophy, religion and morality have been closely intertwined. In this class, we explore to what extent a secular ethical theory is possible. Readings range from antiquity to modernity, including Plato, Kant, Maimonides, Heidegger, and Simone Weil. These authors will help us answering questions, such as, ‘Do I need God’s assistance to become a good person?’, ‘Does the normative power of the moral law require God’s existence?’ ‘Does God need to reveal the moral law in order for me to know it?’
PHIL 20816	Over the last decade or so, there has been a new and prominent wave of &quot;New Atheism,&quot; often promoted in popular books that reach a wide and, apparently, appreciative audience.  Yet, atheism is as old as religion itself, and in the Western tradition has roots that extend into the earliest recorded history.  In this class we will consider atheism on its own merits - its arguments, values, and intentions - but also as a historical phenomenon, tracing its original expressions and especially its rise during the &quot;modern&quot; period beginning in the 17th and 18th centuries.  We will thus focus on Spinoza, Hume, d'Holback, Ludwig Feuerbach, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and among the &quot;New Atheists&quot; Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchins.
PHIL 22100	Discussion section for PHIL 20101. 
PHIL 22408	Discussion section for PHIL 20408 Philosophy of Law
PHIL 30301	This course will concentrate on major figures and persistent themes. A balance will be sought between scope and depth, the latter ensured by a close reading of selected texts.
PHIL 30302	This course examines the sweeping transformations of philosophy in the 17th and 18th centuries by exploring some of the leading philosophers of that era. Topics include innovations in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, philosophical theology, and the natural sciences, many of which continue to shape the agenda in contemporary philosophy.
PHIL 30304	Gateway Seminar for new and prospective majors and minors in Philosophy
PHIL 30305	Offered in the Spring term. Admission to the course only by instructor permission; limited to successful alumni of PHIL 10111 God and the Good Life.   This course has three components. (i) Students will receive training to be a peer dialogue facilitator for God and the Good Life, learning how to lead GGL students in probative dialogue and self-reflection. (ii) Students will do intensive reading and discussion of approaches to living &quot;the philosophical life.&quot; We will study the genre of philosophical apologies (including Socrates, Augustine, Cardinal Newman, Tolstoy and Friedrich Nietzsche). And We will look at radical proposals for living philosophically from Sextus Empiricus, St. Benedict, and the American pragmatists. (iii) Students will design and lead a practical philosophy immersion experience for seminar-mates. The expectation is that students in this course will serve at least one semester as a GGL fellow. Participation in this course is by invitation.
PHIL 30310	This gateway seminar for the Minor in Business and the Common Good will be limited to 24 Mendoza College students, with priority given to students intending to pursue the Minor. The seminar focuses on the place of wealth and commerce in a well-ordered life, both for the individual and the community. Among other topics, the course takes a special interest in the rich Catholic tradition of reflection on these topics, especially the Catholic social teaching relevant to business that has emerged in the last two centuries.
PHIL 30313	An introduction to the fundamentals and techniques of logic for majors.
PHIL 30409	Coming to grips with American political thought is at once an historical and a philosophical task. Students in this course will take on that task under the guidance of one faculty member from the Department of History and one from the Department of Philosophy. The guiding questions of the course are: How have ideas about freedom, equality and the social contract played out in the history of American political thought? When have we realized those ideas and when have we failed? Do those ideas provide us adequate guidance?  The exploration of American political thought will be divided into six periods: The Founding, the Civil War era, the late 19th-century, the New Deal to the 1960s, the 1960s to the 1990s, and the 1990s to the present. The course has no prerequisites, though students wishing to count it toward the Philosophy requirement must previously have taken &quot;Introduction to Philosophy.&quot;
PHIL 32409	Discussion section for PHIL 30409 American Political Thought
PHIL 43339	The goal of this class is to help students think philosophically about ways in which social structures and norms involving gender, race and class affect our personal decisions about what and how much to eat, contribute to disordered eating, impact the environment and workers in the industries that produce our food, and impinge on a variety of other concerns that have been the focus of feminist theorizing.
PHIL 43400	“Democracy &amp; Virtue?” investigates a simple question: Does democracy foster virtue? The class will approach this question, first, through a philosophical investigation of the nature of political regimes, including democratic regimes. This investigation will take place via a careful reading of and discussions about Plato’s Republic. The class will then turn to an examination of America as a modern constitutional democracy. Our primary text for this part of class will be Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. Additional readings from Montesquieu, The Federalist, and Catholic writers will also be introduced. Students should expect to read carefully and deliberately and to participate extensively in class, which will be conducted as a seminar conversation.
PHIL 43503	An upper level survey of philosophical problems in the philosophy of action or a focused exploration of a particular problem or theme in philosophy of action. Content varies by semester.
PHIL 43508	David Lewis was a very influential philosopher of the late twentieth century, and his work still plays a central role in setting the agenda in areas of philosophy including metaphysics, philosophy of language and philosophy of mind. This course will consist of engaging with over a dozen of Lewis's most influential papers and chapters, together with readings from subsequent philosophers which engage with the arguments Lewis offers. Topics include the nature of the mind, the nature of experience, possibility and necessity, causation, the role of context in language and epistemology, the nature of value, and a reflection on Lewis's philosophical method.
PHIL 43605	This upper division course will be an introduction to American Pragmatism ranging over the classical texts of Pierce, James and Dewey to the contemporary texts of Putnam and Rorty.
PHIL 43704	Science and social values?  The established wisdom has it that science offers us the truth about the empirical world - what is rather than what ought to be - and that social values have little to do with it. How else explain the fact that science can be used for both good and ill and that the results of science are (or at least should be) accepted as authoritative by people of widely different ethical and political persuasions?  According to this view, in short, science is, or at least ought to be, &quot;value-free&quot; or &quot;value-neutral.&quot;    In this course we shall explore how recent research in history and sociology as well as philosophy of science has raised serious questions regarding this established wisdom and how such notions as scientific objectivity and autonomy and the role of science in a democratic society has had to be revised accordingly.   Since this is a seminar course, students will lead class discussions, present the results of their individual research projects to the group, and have the opportunity to further develop these projects using the feedback from the group.  The aim, of course, will be for students to develop fully informed and defensible responses to the controversial terrain we shall be exploring.
PHIL 43801	Plato's cosmology in his Timaeus was the definitive Greek account in Antiquity about human beings' place in the universe and their relation to a Maker God.  The Stoics, as in the second book of Cicero's On the Nature of the Gods, took over many ideas from Plato to posit that God is maximally responsible for the order of nature and that there exists a very close kinship between human and divine reason.  Already in the second century BC Plato's cosmology was read alongside the creation account of Genesis, and this pairing deeply influenced the Jewish-Greek author Philo of Alexandria, in his On the Making of the World, as well as the Gospel of John and the 4thc. Cappadocian Gregory of Nyssa, in his On the Six Days of Creation.   Turning to the medieval and Renaissance periods, we will continue our investigation of philosophers and theologians who are concerned to understand the nature of the relationship between God and the world. To this end we will read selections from John Scotus Eriugena's Periphyseon. We will also listen to the music of Hildegard of Bingen, who attempted to represent music of the spheres. With Copernicus and Galileo, however, the general understanding of our place in a divine cosmos dramatically changed, and philosophers, more unsure of our place within it, sought more subjective foundations, most famously, with Descartes's cogito. In short, what used to be obvious to the ancients, the medievals, and even the Renaissance philosophers—that we belonged to a divine cosmos and economy—was no longer. And it took more than a century for philosophers to find some way &quot;back to nature.&quot; Among the most notable of them was the young German Romantic philosopher, F.W.J. von Schelling (1775-1854), who, in his Ideas toward a Philosophy of Nature and later, his Bruno, set out to correct what he considered the one-sidedness of Descartes's view. Turning, finally, to the modern period we will read two works, one by C.S. Lewis, The Discarded Image on ancient and medieval cosmology, and another by Hans Urs von Balthasar, who sought to overcome the dialectic between ancient-cosmological and modern-anthropological starting points with a phenomenology of love.
PHIL 43906	A survey of central issues in the philosophy of mathematics.
PHIL 43913	This course covers topics in the metatheory of modal logic. We will start with some basic correspondence theory, and then move on to discuss completeness and the finite model property. If we have time, we'll also cover some recent work on the relationship between modal logic and classical logic.
PHIL 43922	This is a first course in mathematical logic aimed at senior level mathematics students but also suitable for students from philosophy and computer science. The course is about what it means for a statement, in a suitable formalism (propositional or predicate logic) to be true, false, tautological, etc. and what methods there are for checking or proving this. More precisely the course will include the syntax and semantics of propositional and predicate logic, as well as proof systems and completeness theorems. Included among texts that may be used for the course are  (i) A mathematical introduction to logic, by Herbert Enderton.  (ii) Logic for Computer Scientists, by Uwe Sch  (iii) Logic for mathematics and computer science, by Stanley Burris.  The book (i) is a traditional treatment of the subject. Books (ii) and (iii) include the resolution method or calculus for checking unsatisfiability, which is related to logic programming and automated reasoning.
PHIL 43923	Thinking about infinity has been part of philosophy since its earliest days, and mathematical advances in the theory of infinity mean it remains an important area for philosophy today. This course will examine some ancient and early modern puzzles about infinity as well as contemporary philosophical issues. Issues to be discussed will include puzzles about infinite divisibility of space and time; paradoxes of infinite decision theory; infinite regress arguments; and paradoxes associated with the &quot;absolute infinite&quot; in mathematics.

PHIL 93238	An in-depth investigation into three competing medieval theories of intellect, from Avicenna (Ibn Sina), Averroes (Ibn Rushd), and Thomas Aquinas. These are three of the most important medieval noetic systems, which adapt Aristotelian and Neo-Platonic views within the Islamic and Christian traditions and which shape influential debates into later medieval and Renaissance philosophy. Readings include Avicenna's Psychology of The Cure; Averroes' Long Commentary on De Anima; Aquinas's De Unitate Intellectus; and important secondary scholarship.
PHIL 93413	This seminar discusses current research by junior and senior scholars in philosophy of religion, providing an overview of a variety of cutting edge issues within this discipline.
PHIL 93505	The metaphysics of the social world (including gender, race, disability, sexual orientation, and religious identities) has seen a recent surge in philosophical interest. This seminar will explore cutting-edge social metaphysics, with a strong emphasis on recently published and forthcoming work. Topics will include the metaphysics of social categories, non-ideal social metaphysics, the metaphysics of masculinity, trans philosophy, intersectionality, and social metaphysics as fundamental metaphysics. Several virtual visits from social metaphysicians are planned.
PHIL 93606	This course will focus on some of the central texts of the philosophy of Edith Stein. Edith Stein was an important member of the phenomenological movement: she was Husserl's first assistant (Heidegger followed after) and wrote important works in this tradition.  She was also a scholar of scholastic philosophy.  One of her last works is a treatise on systematic metaphysics that integrates insights from phenomenology, neo-Kantianism, and scholastic metaphysics.       We’ll begin by discussing the general philosophical and contextual background to Edith Stein's early works. We’ll then discuss several of her works, ranging from her first book The Problem of Empathy up to Finite and Eternal Being.  We will largely focus on her views about philosophical methodology, phenomenology, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and metaphysics, though we will also touch on her ethics and philosophy of religion.
PHIL 93705	How does philosophy work? While there is no single philosophical method, philosophers are frequently concerned with metaphysical possibilities—possibilities in the broad sense, unconstrained by the laws of physics. As such, rather than employing real-world experiments, philosophy employs thought experiments: experiments carried out in the imagination, scrutinizing questions that may lie beyond the scope of science, questions not about our world but about hypothetical worlds, worlds that may contain nothing other than two perfectly symmetrical, solid iron spheres, each the mirror image of the other, or a murky swamp that, when struck by lightning, gives rise to a fully functioning person replete with apparent memories of their past. Such thought experiments are designed to provoke startling insights into what is possible. And, in the best of cases, these insights are said to reveal something important about what is actual. In this class, we’ll examine whether philosophical thought experiments can bridge the gap between metaphysical possibility and this-worldly reality and consider alternative philosophical methodologies, such as empirical philosophy.
PHIL 93805	This research course will explore the structure of scientific theories, with a special emphasis on the non-formal, non-literal and practical content of theories, as well as the phenomena of modeling and idealization. The primary text for the course is Duhem's The Aim and Structure of Physical Theories. We will spend the first 5 weeks of the course on a careful reading of Duhem, before turning to Mark Wilson's Duhemian thoughts in his Physics Avoidance: Essays in Conceptual Strategy. After that, we will survey the syntactic and semantic views of theories, and consider pragmatic responses by Nancy Cartwright, Hasok Chang, and other practice-based philosophers of science. Finally, we will consider the implications of our discussion for the realism/antirealism debate in the philosophy of science, as well as neo-Aristotelian attempts to articulate the practical thought inherent in science. The course will feature guest lectures by various research visitors. 
PHIL 93812	This course examines the work of key figures from the history of natural philosophy and science.  Placing the philosophical work of Leibniz, Newton, Hume, Kant, Alexander Humboldt, Whewell, J. S. Mill, Helmholtz, Ernst Mach, Wilhelm Wundt, William James, Einstein, Henri Poincare, Bergson, and others, within a wider philosophical, historical, and cultural context, we will explore how and why they identified their central problems and the methods they used to approach those.   We will focus on understanding how the central problems and theories that these figures worked on, ranging from questions of space, time, motion and substance/matter to theories of human sensibility and perception, to wider epistemological and metaphysical investigations, engaged the scholarly communities surrounding them, and helped them promote broader programmatic goals for reshaping and reforming philosophy/science.  As they engaged contemporary philosophers/scientists over fundamental philosophical questions, they pressed new ideals of knowledge and programs to reform natural philosophy and reorganize the broader scholarly community - and society itself (e.g., Kant).  We will explore how these natural philosophers framed new epistemologies and simultaneously promoted new ideals of the philosopher, scholar, and/or educated citizen, who would be capable of creating valid knowledge.  In sum, we will explore how preeminent natural philosophers, at once, made original contributions to epistemology, understanding of space and time, and metaphysics, as they framed new visions of the knowing subject within a changing society.  
PHIL 93821	Science and social values?  The established wisdom has it that science offers us the truth about the empirical world - what is rather than what ought to be - and that social values have little to do with it. How else explain the fact that science can be used for both good and ill and that the results of science are (or at least should be) accepted as authoritative by people of widely different ethical and political persuasions?  According to this view, in short, science is, or at least ought to be, &quot;value-free&quot; or &quot;value-neutral.&quot;    In this course we shall explore how recent research in history and sociology as well as philosophy of science has raised serious questions regarding this established wisdom and how such notions as scientific objectivity and autonomy and the role of science in a democratic society has had to be revised accordingly.   Since this is a seminar course, students will lead class discussions, present the results of their individual research projects to the group, and have the opportunity to further develop these projects using the feedback from the group.  The aim, of course, will be for students to develop fully informed and defensible responses to the controversial terrain we shall be exploring.
PHIL 93921	This course covers topics in the metatheory of modal logic. We will start with some basic correspondence theory, and then move on to discuss completeness and the finite model property.

PHIL 98690	A seminar designed for people writing dissertations or preparing some part(s) of one for use as a writing sample or as a submission for publication or both.
PHIL 98696	&quot;Shut Up and Write&quot; provides a communal area for writing, for starting, continuing, or restarting writing projects that have fallen by the wayside.     Writing is some of the most important work we do as philosophers, but it's mostly invisible. Generally, faculty write alone in their offices, or off campus. Graduate students don't see their faculty mentors engaging in writing; they only see the output. This group will show philosophers doing an essential part of their jobs that is normally done behind closed doors, with the aim of taking away its mystery. Writing is also often done in isolation, which can make it more difficult and occasionally depressing. &quot;Shut Up and Write&quot; helps to make writing visible and to break its isolation.

The Practicum Coordinator will match physics graduate students wishing to gain teaching experience with physics instructors who are willing to mentor qualified graduate students in teaching selected lectures in their course. This opportunity is limited to three lectures each per semester for both the faculty and the graduate students. Each lecture will be subject to the agreement of the course instructor and observer and arranged with the Practicum Coordinator at least a week in advance of the lecture. Instructors serving as mentors will be expected to work with the graduate student on the preparation of the lecture for the course. A faculty observer for the lecture will then be selected. The observer will provide one page of written feedback to the student and discuss the results with the student in a follow-up interview. A teaching portfolio/notebook documents the planning, observation, and student's reflection on the experience.  The class, PHYS 95000, will be added to a student's transcript with the grade of &quot;S&quot; once three lectures and teaching portfolio are completed. The three lectures need not all be with the same instructor and may be spread over more than one semester.
PHYS 98200	This course is a required course for graduate students who have completed eight years of study.
PHYS 98699	Research and dissertation for resident graduate students.
PHYS 98700	Required of nonresident graduate students who are completing their dissertations in absentia and who wish to retain their degree status.
PLS 13186	Through the study of some of the greatest works of ancient literature, across a range of genres, we will seek not just better understanding of these complex, fascinating works, but the development of skills in textual analysis, oral and written argumentation, and discussion. This seminar also serves as an introduction to the curriculum and discussion-based method of the Program of Liberal Studies.
PLS 13188	In his classic book &quot;Philosophy as a Way of Life,&quot; the French philosopher Pierre Hadot argued that ancient Mediterranean &quot;philosophia&quot; – the pursuit of wisdom – entailed not merely a body of knowledge or a narrow set of intellectual methods but an entire “way of life.” In a similar vein, we might ask what constitutes an “intellectual life,” a life that takes the pursuit of truth as a central and salient orientation. What features, structures, and practices characterize such a life? Does an intellectual life require withdrawal to a solitary, monastic existence in libraries and quiet contemplation? Or can it be lived alongside raising children and working a typical job? If so, how? Further, what, if anything, demarcates a particularly Catholic intellectual life, and how might one cultivate such a life?  This course aims to help students grapple with these questions by reading and discussing authors, Catholics and non-Catholics alike, whose lives and work can inform our understanding of the intellectual life. Yet the course is not merely theoretical: students will be challenged, and indeed required, to test and weigh ideas from the course by putting them into practice and reflecting upon them. Our goal, ultimately, is not to learn about the intellectual life but to begin to foster that life ourselves.
PLS 20302	A close study of the selected books Bible. The course will consider the role of the Bible in the life of the church, the history of its interpretation and the various approaches of modern scholarship. Spring.
PLS 20412	This course raises questions fundamental to our experience of the physical world. Questions such as &quot;What is space?&quot; and &quot;What is time?&quot; and broader issues about the nature of life are initially raised through a close reading of Plato's &lt;i&gt;Timaeus&lt;/i&gt; and Aristotle's &lt;i&gt;Physics&lt;/i&gt;, along with excerpts from other ancient texts. In attempting to answer these questions over the course of the semester, we will read a wide variety of sources: principally ancient and modern primary texts, with some secondary readings. These readings will include Euclid's &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt;, Descartes' &lt;i&gt;Principles of Philosophy&lt;/i&gt;, and Einstein's &lt;i&gt;Theories of Relativity&lt;/i&gt;. Spring.

PLS 30202	Building on the techniques of close reading developed in Literature I, this course will focus on the expressive power of literary genres, modes, and conventions and will take up the question of the unity and coherence of long works. The reading list will include several plays by Shakespeare and Milton's &lt;i&gt;Paradise Lost&lt;/i&gt;. In some years, another major English narrative poem may be substituted for &lt;i&gt;Paradise Lost&lt;/i&gt; (such as Chaucer's &lt;i&gt;Troilus and Criseyde&lt;/i&gt;, Spenser's &lt;i&gt;Faerie Queene&lt;/i&gt;, or Wordsworths &lt;i&gt;Prelude&lt;/i&gt;). Spring.
PLS 30302	An approach to understanding the fundamental problems of political community and the nature of various solutions, especially that of democracy. Readings will include, but are not limited to, Aristotle's &lt;i&gt;Politics&lt;/i&gt;, Locke's &lt;i&gt;Second Treatise&lt;/i&gt;, and selections from &lt;i&gt;The Federalist Papers&lt;/i&gt; and American founding documents.

PLS 40302	An engagement with philosophical conceptions of the nature of knowledge, reality, and the relation between them. Selections from the Platonic tradition, Aristotle's &lt;i&gt;Metaphysics&lt;/i&gt;, and Kant's &lt;i&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/i&gt; form the basis of the course. Other readings may include works by such thinkers as Aquinas, Heidegger, and other 20th Century authors. Spring.
PLS 40412	In this course students will explore what can science tell us about human nature and human social interactions.  By reading and discussing important historical and contemporary texts, students will engage the conundrums, challenges and insights created through the scientific study of human beings and society.  Readings will include works by Charles Darwin, William James, and Jean Piaget. Spring.

Faculty members working with small groups of students help them define their topics and guide them, usually on a one-to-one basis, in the preparation of their essays.
POLS 10100	This course surveys the basic institutions and practices of American politics. The goal of the course is to gain a more systematic understanding of American politics that will help you become better informed and more articulate. The course examines the institutional and constitutional framework of American politics and identifies the key ideas needed to understand politics today. The reading and writing assignments have been designed not only to inform you, but also to help develop your analytic and research skills. The themes of the course include the logic and consequences of the separation of powers, the build-in biases of institutions and procedures, the origins and consequence of political reforms, connections between demographics and politics, and recent changes in American politics in the 21st century. This semester we will emphasize the significance of the upcoming elections. Although the course counts toward the Political Science major and will prepare prospective majors for further study of American politics, its primary aim is to introduce students of all backgrounds and interests to the information, ideas, and academic skills that will enable them to understand American politics better. 
POLS 10200	This course provides an introduction to the study of international relations.  It covers several approaches to and issues in the field, including theories of international politics, war, nuclear weapons, terrorism, trade, finance, globalization, international law and human rights, and the environment.
POLS 10400	In this course, we study how and why politics takes place as it does in countries around the world. We explore the origins of nation-states and seek to understand how democracy develops or decays. We investigate several country-cases in detail, including Britain, China, France, Germany, India, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, and South Africa. For these and other countries, we study how globalization poses new challenges and opportunities for creating order, justice, and human flourishing.
POLS 10600	This course is an introduction to political theory as a tradition of discourse and as a way of thinking about politics. The course surveys selected works of political theory and explores some of the recurring themes and questions that political theory addresses. This introductory course fulfils the political theory breadth requirement for the political science major.
POLS 12200	Discussion Section for International Relations.
POLS 13181	A seminar for first-year students devoted to an introductory topic in political science in which writing skills are stressed.
POLS 20100	The purpose of this course is for students to become familiarized with  American government. First, we will explore the structure of government including the origins of democracy, the founding of The United States, and the components of our Constitution. Secondly, we will discuss the connection between the structure of government and those who govern. This political linkage includes public opinion, political parties, the media, and voting and elections. Thirdly, we will review the three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. Finally, we will address what government does – i.e., laws, policies, and executive action. Throughout this semester, we will stay current on our knowledge of breaking news and politics; watching or reading the news is a requirement for our success in understanding how our government works. In short, the class is organized into four sections: (1) the structure of government, (2) political linkage, (3) the branches of government, and (4) the role of government.
POLS 20200	This course introduces the major questions, theories, and topics in the study of international relations. The course is divided in three parts. The first part focuses on the main schools of international relations theory and how they understand the effects of anarchy on the international system. The second part covers major topics in the study of international relations in two issues areas. We will first examine topics in international security pertaining to the causes, conduct, and mitigators of violence among state and non-state actors. We will then focus on topics in international political economy, such as the distributive effects of trade, the rise of finance, economic development, among others. The last part of the course centers on the future of world order. We will study how key stakeholders of the international system define and articulate their interests in a world where power is increasingly diffused.   By the end of this course, students will be able to: - Evaluate critically the readings by examining the logic, data, and conclusions presented by the author(s). - Understand the assumptions and conclusions of the main schools of international relations theory regarding the effects of anarchy in the international system. - Isolate the main sources of peace and conflict in international politics. - Identify which international actors, institutions, and processes shape world politics.
POLS 20400	Comparative politics is the study of world politics. More technically, it is the subfield of political science that uses the comparative method to study the politics within nations. The focus on politics within nations distinguishes comparative politics from international relations, another subfield of political science concerned with studying politics across nations – e.g. diplomacy, war, trade, international organizations. This course introduces students to big questions in comparative politics that are also of fundamental relevance for the world today. We will examine theories and evidence concerning three themes: States and Political Regimes, Democracy (its emergence, quality and erosion), and Development. The course focuses on substance, but we will also evaluate the quality of the evidence and theoretical logic underpinning influential ideas in comparative politics. Though the course is organized around questions, the readings and lectures will often draw on the experience of individual countries. We will also read widely, covering political science, history, economics, sociology, evolutionary biology and anthropology, and draw on specialized readings as well as clips and pieces aimed at a broader audience.
POLS 20600	This course is an introduction to political theory as a tradition of discourse and as a way of thinking about politics. The course surveys selected works of political theory and explores some of the recurring themes and questions that political theory addresses, especially the question of justice. This introductory course fulfils the political theory breadth requirement for the political science major.
POLS 22200	Discussion section for corequisite International Relations.
POLS 30005	This course is a comprehensive introduction to the workings of the contemporary U.S. Congress. We will examine who runs for and who wins seats in Congress, the lawmaking processes in the House and Senate, and the roles of parties and leaders in the two chambers. The purpose of this course is to examine two fundamental questions: (1) what do members of Congress do and why and (2) how do the individual and collective actions of members of Congress explain national policy? We will examine the process of legislating as well as the role of political parties, leaders, and interest groups. Throughout the semester, we will debate the common criticism that “Congress is broken” and consider its effectiveness as an institution. Is policymaking too partisan? Is the public’s disapproval of Congress justified?
POLS 30024	Although the mass media is not formally part of the U.S. government, it is arguably the most powerful institution shaping public attitudes, creating and producing information, and communicating political information to individual citizens.  Almost all exposure to politics comes not from direct experience but from mediated stories. And, with the rise of the Internet, the growth of 24-hour cable news, and the decline of the &quot;Big Three&quot; television networks has created, a more diffuse media environment has been created. The primary purpose of this course is to analyze the role of the media in American politics and its relationship with the public, government, and candidates for office in a democratic society.
POLS 30028	This course will examine the many ways in which religion has been fused into American politics. In doing so, we will also explore the rising tide of secularism in the United States, which many argue has resulted from a backlash to the fusion of religion and conservative politics. Then it will turn to trying to solve the puzzle of America's religious pluralism—if religion is so politically divisive, why are Americans so accepting of (most) religions other than their own? What explains the exceptions to that acceptance? What are the implications of a secularizing America for religious pluralism?
POLS 30035	This course introduces students to the dynamics of the social and historical construction of race and ethnicity in American political life. The course explores the following core questions: What are race and ethnicity? What are the best ways to think about the impact of race and ethnicity on American citizens? What is the history of racial and ethnic formation in American political life? How do race and ethnicity link up with other identities animating political actions like gender and class? What role do American political institutions the Congress, presidency, judiciary, state and local governments, etc. play in constructing and maintaining these identity categories? Can these institutions ever be used to overcome the points of division in American society?
POLS 30039	This course undertakes a broad examination of black politics in multiracial America. Racial issues have provoked crises in American politics; changes in racial status have prompted American political institutions to operate in distinctive ways. The course examines the interface of black politics with and within the American political system. How successful have blacks been as they attempted to penetrate the electoral system in the post civil rights era. What conflicts and controversies have arisen as African Americans have sought to integrate the American system of power. Now that the laws have been changed to permit limited integration, should African Americans integrate politically, that is should they attempt to 'deracialize' their political appeals and strategy, with an effort to &quot;crossover politically;&quot; are some approaches such as those of President Barack Obama &quot;not black enough?&quot; What internal political challenges do African Americans face; some such as the increasing importance of class and socioeconomic factors, as well as gender and sexuality may reshape the definition of the black community. What intellectual challenges and strategic choices are they facing as the American population has grown increasingly multiracial. Finally, in light of these demographic changes in American life and American politics, how stable will past patterns of political participation, and political organizations and institutions of African American politics remain.
POLS 30045	In the past four decades, the United States has experienced an unprecedented rise in income and wealth inequality. Inequalities across multiple other dimensions (race, ethnicity, geography, and gender) are also pervasive. This course examines a multitude of questions related to politics, policy, and varieties of inequality. How has the American political system and the policies it produces affected levels of inequality in the U.S.? How has inequality shaped American politics and policy? What is the relationship between income and power? What are the political consequences of increasing income inequality? What are the implications of racial and ethnic inequities for the quality of democratic representation? Which policies increase political inequality? What are effective remedies for unequal influence? Finally, which institutions move democratic practice furthest towards full democratic equality and which ones serve to reinforce historical hierarchies? This course is designed to help students understand the political causes and consequences of inequality in America and consider potential interventions to support human flourishing for all. 
POLS 30063	This course covers a lot of constitutional terrain involved in the area of criminal justice, from investigative steps through trial and sentencing. It covers significant issues in Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendment law as well as situating them within broader philosophical concerns about justice, Catholic Social Teaching, and the questions of race.
POLS 30104	Sixty years ago, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, in broad daylight, in the presence of hundreds of witnesses, while traveling in his presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas, Texas. On that day, a historic presidency came to a tragic end. Two days later, the alleged assassin (Lee Harvey Oswald) was murdered by a Dallas nightclub owner (Jack Ruby) while being escorted from his cell by a host of police officers, raising the possibility of a conspiracy. The official investigation into Kennedy's assassination (&quot;The Warren Report&quot;) was met with fierce public skepticism, precipitating numerous Congressional investigations that revealed extensive covert operations (both in the US and abroad) conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that would have been relevant to those charged with investigating the assassination. When combined with an already heightened public skepticism of the assassination itself, these revelations proved to be an enduring catalyst for a slow and steady decline of public trust in government that continues unabated to our present day. In this course, we examine the origins and rise of the &quot;security state&quot; in the United States, its role in significant events in the Kennedy presidency, including the investigation into his assassination, and the extent of its power both before and after Kennedy's presidency. Ultimately, students will be asked whether and to what extent the demands of national security conflict with the constitutional prerogatives of a representative democracy.
POLS 30127	This course will examine ways that law structures, promotes, and governs the practice of democracy in America. Topics include key features of the American constitution, including federalism, bicameralism, the separation of powers, and judicial review; the First Amendment and the freedoms of speech and press; voting rights, elections, parties, and campaigns; and the changes caused and challenges posed by technological and other developments.
POLS 30136	This course will examine the opportunities and challenges facing Latino communities today as they simultaneously transform and are transformed by their continuing growth in U.S. society.  Through a careful examination of the biographies of leaders in Latino communities, we will examine what role they have each played in empowering Latino communities to advance in business, arts, education, community organizing, entertainment, medicine, religion, law, academia, politics, and other areas.  The course will coincide with the Transformative Latino Leadership Speaker Series sponsored by the Arthur Foundation through the Institute for Latino Studies.  Students in the class will have the opportunity to interact with invited leaders in several setting including the classroom, meals, receptions, and university-wide events.  The primary course requirement is a research essay about the life and career of a chosen leader.
POLS 30161	This course will focus on the writings of Black political thinkers in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. Through critical examination of the conditions against, and contexts within, which the political theories of these thinkers are situated, this course hopes to arrive at some understanding of the principles, goals and strategies developed to contest and redefine notions/concepts of citizenship (vis-a-vis the imperatives of race/racism and the global colonial formations), humanity, justice, equality, development, democracy, and freedom.
POLS 30175	Ingrained in our daily lives, the use and interaction with digital devices and the internet have given rise to technology-facilitated crimes. This course introduces the psychology behind these offenses and their perpetrators. Students will delve into the motivations and behaviors of diverse offenders, such as hackers, online child offenders, cyber stalkers, and identity thieves. Additionally, the course explores the psychology of individuals engaged in online activities linked to mass killings, alongside essential techniques of threat assessment. By comprehending the psychological aspects of digital deviance, students will be better equipped to address and mitigate the challenges posed by technology-driven criminal behaviors.
POLS 30201	The United States is the most powerful state in the world today. Its actions are important not just for US citizens, but they also affect whether others go to war, whether they will win their wars, whether they receive economic aid, whether they will go broke, or whether they will starve. What determines US foreign policy? What is the national interest? When do we go to war? Would you send US soldiers into war? If so, into which wars and for what reasons? How do our economic policies affect others? Does trade help or hurt the US economy and its citizens? We first study several theories about foreign policy. We then examine the US foreign policy process, including the President, Congress, the bureaucracy, the media, and public opinion. To see how this all works, we turn to the history of US foreign policy, from Washington's farewell address through the World Wars and the Cold War to the Gulf War. We then study several major issue areas, including weapons of mass destruction, trade and economics, and the environment. Finally, we develop and debate forecasts and strategies for the future.
POLS 30266	This course examines the intersection of politics and economics in an increasingly global world.  Economic interdependence has increased dramatically over the past fifty years.  While this has raised living standards in many countries, it has also given rise to new social, economic, and political tensions.  This course offers an analytical framework for evaluating the consequences of globalization and provides an overview of several theoretical approaches to and empirical issues in today's global economy. The course is divided into three main sections.  The first part of the course focuses on understanding what is meant by 'globalization' as well as an introduction to several contending theories of globalization.  The second part of the course will focus on managing globalization, and will evaluate different options available to states, institutions, and other actors.  The final section of the class will be devoted to empirical issues associated with globalization.  Topics discussed include:  the environment, corruption, human rights, non-governmental organizations, democratization, and regional trading blocs.
POLS 30308	Throughout the past century, nationalism and populism have stood as two of the most powerful forces in global politics. The recent successful political campaigns of those such as Donald Trump, Victor Orban, and Jair Bolsonaro have displayed the enduring need for both scholars and students of politics to understand and examine these two political dynamics. This course will first explore the conceptual foundations of nationalism and populism and the debates surrounding their sources. Next, students will examine the consequences for both domestic and foreign policy, including such issues as trade, regime durability, international institutions, and war. Finally, the course will investigate both historical and contemporary cases of nationalist and populist leaders across the globe
POLS 30321	Global environmental politics is a field of political science that examines how political processes shape environmental outcomes and vice versa. On the one hand, it is concerned with issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation, and natural resource use. On the other hand, it studies things like political institutions, social movements, party systems, and state-business relations. All the while, it places these ideas in a cross-national, global perspective. Throughout this course, students will grapple with both foundational and emerging questions in the study of global environmental politics. Why do some governments have stronger environmental policies than others? When do interest groups support or oppose different forms of environmental regulation? What role do social movements play in supporting diverse coalitions of environmental interests? How do voters form and express preferences for or against environmental action?
POLS 30363	An introduction to the field of international development, with particular focus on the various disciplines that have contributed to and shaped the development discourse. Readings, lectures, and discussions will draw from various disciplines, including economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, environmental and technological sciences, public health, law, and gender studies, among others. We will examine debates on the meaning and measurement of development; alternative approaches to, and methods in, the study of development; and attempts to address some of the main development challenges facing the world today. There will be a central focus on understanding &quot;what works&quot; in development. Working together in teams, students will conceptualize and design an international development project using &quot;real world&quot; constraints.
POLS 30401	Politics of Latin America is intended to be a multi-disciplinary introduction to critical issues within contemporary Latin American culture, society, politics, and economy. An assumption behind the organization of this course is that many of the traditional boundaries between different disciplines in the social sciences and the humanities are drawn somewhat arbitrarily, and that a more comprehensive understanding of Latin America can, and even should, be approached from a number of different analytic and disciplinary lenses. Thus, we will trespass traditional disciplinary boundaries from time to time over the course of the semester. The course is divided into two major parts. The first part is organized around a number of key analytic lenses, which we will employ sequentially with an aim to gaining a deeper appreciation of important aspects of contemporary Latin America. We will begin with a discussion of the utility of &quot;culture&quot; as a tool for understanding Latin America. Is there such a thing as &quot;Latin America&quot; understood as a discrete category of countries, and if so, what do they share in common? We will follow this discussion with an exploration of what is certainly a chief cultural expression among any people, an exploration of levels of religiosity and their relationship to social and political behavior. Other key features of culture will be woven into the analyses of the case studies we will undertake for the remainder of the course. We will explore the wide variation in the quality of democratic governance in different Latin American countries. And we will we look to some of the sources of that variation, including democratic institution building, economic and social policy making, and the persistence of populist politics, and forces in the international arena, such as U.S Foreign Policy, among other factors. In the remainder of the course, we will look specifically at country-cases in comparative perspective, in particular Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela. In selecting these cases, I have made a conscious decision to sacrifice breadth for greater depth. An effort will be made throughout the discussion of the cases to make broader comparisons with a wider range of Latin American cases.
POLS 30407	Why have some countries in Latin American developed into democracies, while others have seen the rise of dictatorships? Why have some countries remained at peace while others are often at war? This course examines historical, economic, regional, and international factors that have influenced political development in Latin America.
POLS 30485	The death of a Supreme Court Justice triggers a bitter partisan battle over the impending nomination. Is this tragedy unique to the United States? Why are political parties so eager to control the Court? This course will explore how constitutional norms seek to protect judicial independence, and how political parties &quot;game&quot; such constitutional norms worldwide. We will analyze episodes of &quot;packing&quot; and &quot;purging&quot; of supreme courts and constitutional tribunals in different countries. We will investigate the practice of &quot;strategic retirement&quot; in the US Supreme Court, the threat posed by legislative majorities to judicial independence, and the slippery slope of partisan manipulation. We will also address whether judicial purges constitute opportunities for a more balanced judiciary (for instance, in terms of gender). Comparative analysis will help us learn from the experience of other nations. This course will introduce students to basic notions of game theory and quantitative analysis.
POLS 30543	 In 1987, the Soviet Union was the largest political entity on the planet. Four years later, it had vanished from the map entirely. In this interdisciplinary course, you will learn about the ‘new Russia’ that has emerged in the three decades since this stunning collapse. Drawing on an array of resources in English translation, you will explore the politics, media, and culture of the post-Soviet period: from the lawless years of the “wild 90s” under Boris Yeltsin to the return of totalitarianism under Vladimir Putin and his brutal invasion of Ukraine. In so doing, your study of contemporary Russia will lead us to discuss some of the most pressing questions in global politics today. What is the nature of truth and power in Putin’s dystopian propaganda state? Should the current leadership in Russia be described as a fascist regime or neo-Soviet? And, perhaps most importantly, how did Russia’s democratic experiment ultimately end with the launch of the largest war in Europe since 1945—and what lessons might this failure hold for America and the rest of the world?
POLS 30665	In &quot;Constitutionalism, Law &amp; Politics II: American Constitutionalism,&quot; we shall study fundamental texts of the American constitutional and political tradition in an attempt to answer questions such as: What is the purpose of government? What is the meaning of political equality? What is political liberty and how is it best secured? Since we lack the time for a comprehensive survey of American political thinkers, we shall examine select statesmen and critical historical periods, focusing on the Founding era, Lincoln and the slavery crisis, and the Progressive era and New Deal.
POLS 30700	“Democracy &amp; Virtue?” investigates a simple question: Does democracy foster virtue? The class will approach this question, first, through a philosophical investigation of the nature of political regimes, including democratic regimes. This investigation will take place via a careful reading of and discussions about Plato’s Republic. The class will then turn to an examination of America as a modern constitutional democracy. Our primary text for this part of class will be Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. Additional readings from Montesquieu, The Federalist, and Catholic writers will also be introduced. Students should expect to read carefully and deliberately and to participate extensively in class, which will be conducted as a seminar conversation.
POLS 30705	The subject of the course is Catholic apologetics in the generation of millennials (and Gen Z). Studies show that teens and young adults are leaving the Church in large numbers and that the ones who stay do not subscribe to Church teachings. Seeking to &quot;meet them where they are,&quot; the course begins with an examination of contemporary trends in the religious lives of millennials, with a particular focus on Catholics. It proceeds to examine the major reasons why millennials are leaving the Catholic Church and to engage students in arguments for and against the Church's positions on: the rationality of God, science, sex and marriage, the Church's role in historical injustices, and politics. In the final portion of the course, we will pivot to a &quot;positive apologetics&quot; look at the case for the Church through beauty and the witness of the saints, modes of engagement that are said to appeal to the millennial generation. The course concludes with the case for the resurrection of Jesus. Taught in the political science department, the course considers the political dimension of each unit, corresponding to the politicized character each of the disputed questions in the mind of contemporary young adults who are leaving the Church, as studies of opinion demonstrate. The course will be taught with a range of students in mind: those who are confident in their Catholic faith and wish to learn how to persuade others; those who are unsure of their Catholic faith; those who are of a different Christian or religious faith and interested in learning about the Catholic faith; and those who are skeptical of the Catholic faith.
POLS 30707	This seminar-style course will examine foundational questions of constitutional order. We will begin from debates about the nature of political society among contemporary thinkers, Jurgen Habermas, Pope Benedict, John Rawls, and Carl Schmitt. We will then focus on key Ancient, Medieval, and Modern thinkers: Aristotle, Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and the Federalist writers. Our aim will be to attain clarity about the questions that are fundamental to every constitutional order, especially the character of our &quot;original&quot; or pre-political condition, the status of war and peace, the nature of political authority and law, and the proper ends of political community.
POLS 30751	The &quot;Core Texts in Citizenship &amp; Constitutional Government'' course sequence offers a select group of students an opportunity to study some of the seminal texts in history and philosophy of constitutional government. Students will study classical texts with Prof. Susan Collins (Fall) and modern texts with Prof. Mary Keys (Spring), including: Plato, Aristotle, the Bible, Augustine, Aquinas, Locke, Rousseau, Tocqueville, and others. Through small seminars, students will engage in a year-long conversation about justice, equality, liberty, and the rule of law. The sequence is designed for students looking for and willing to engage in deep, deliberate, and careful study of core texts of Western constitutionalism. No application required.
POLS 30813	Politics, markets, and the environment are all spheres of development that are fundamentally shaped by the action and interaction of many individuals over time. For example, the Arab Spring protests, the shortage of medicines in Caracas, and the rising water temperatures of the Baltic Sea are all system-level outcomes arising from the individual actions of thousands or even billions of people. In these spheres, leadership is often weak or non-existent. Scientists call these &quot;complex systems.&quot; Complexity is difficult to study in the real world. Instead, scientists often approach these phenomenon using computer simulations (sometimes called agent-based models, social network models, and computational models). The goal is to build computer models of development that link the actions and interactions of individuals to the system-level outcomes. This class will use the perspective, literature, and tools of complexity science to approach core questions in the field of development. 
POLS 32705	These are the Friday discussion sections required, as a co-requisite, for POLS 30705, Why the Church? lecture course.
POLS 35901	The goal of the internship program is to provide opportunities to integrate coursework with real work experience. Interns are able to explore career options, gain valuable work experience, and build their resume. The Political Science department can help connect students with a variety of organizations in the South Bend community. Students may also receive credit for an internship they have arranged, but must receive approval from the instructor prior to starting the internship. During the semester, students commit 6 hours per week to interning, preferably in two 3-hour blocks of time. During the summer, students commit to interning 20 hours per week for six weeks. Interested students should contact Claudia.Francis@nd.edu
POLS 35902	Under the guidance of law school students and staff lawyers, interns participating in the Exoneration Justice Clinic (EJC) will review correspondence from inmates claiming wrongful convictions based on actual innocence in Indiana prisons and conduct research into the validity of the claims. Interns will also research resources available to assist exonerees upon release from prison to reintegrate into the community. The EJC is located at 806 Howard Street in South Bend. During the semester, interns will work 6-8 hours per week including a mandatory meeting on Thursdays from 12:30-2:00pm (no exceptions/late arrivals).During the summer, interns will work 40 hours per week for 8 weeks. To apply, contact Claudia.Francis@nd.edu
POLS 40490	This interdisciplinary course explores the challenges of environmental sustainability through social, economic, scientific, and theological lenses. Taught jointly by professors from the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences, the course aims to instill broad, integrative and critical thinking about contemporary global environmental problems whose solutions will depend on multidisciplinary approaches. This gateway course to the Minor in Sustainability is open to all students interested in a deep exploration of these critical issues. Students considering the Minor in Sustainability are encouraged to take this course during their sophomore year. Requirements include a field trip and two hours of community volunteer work.
POLS 40505	At a moment when global challenges - from climate change to inclusive development to public health threats - loom large, many nation-states seem unable to come together to address them. In what ways are the world's cities and subnational governments working on their own and in concert to meet these challenges? This course examines the distinctive roles and capacities of cities, provinces, and states in managing global policy issues and explores different modes of trans-local cooperation and coordination. We start by considering the global governance shortcomings of nation-states and exploring the multilevel character of key policy challenges. We next use case studies from different issue-areas to assess how action by subnational governments is contributing to but also complicating solutions. We conclude by discussing the limitations of subnational approaches to global challenges and considering the most appropriate policy roles and portfolios for subnational actors in the 21st century. 
POLS 40520	What are Beijing's objectives towards the developing world and how have they have evolved and been pursued over time? In light of China's unprecedented Belt and Road Initiative and increasingly assertive military activities far from its shores, the answer to this question is perhaps more important than ever before. This course analyzes and explains China's strategies in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Latin America, and evaluates their effectiveness. It is informed by the functionally organized academic literature, but uses a regional approach that allows for comparisons among regions based on their economic, political, military, and social characteristics. Topics will cut across the overlapping political, economic and security spheres, with particular attention paid to how different developing countries have perceived and responded to China's rapidly growing engagement and influence. This structure allows us to consider not only the unique features of Chinese engagement in each region, but also place them in the larger context of Beijing's strategy towards other developing regions and the developing world as a whole. This course will be of great interest to students and scholars interested in international development, Chinese foreign policy, comparative political economy, and international relations. 
POLS 40805	This course is designed to guide juniors through the process of designing an original research project in the field of political science. Students will learn how to choose a topic, formulate an original research question, design and conduct appropriate research to answer this question, develop a thesis statement, and gather and analyze evidence/data to test the strength of their argument. Students will spend the semester constructing a research design that will outline the details of their research project. This course is not for current thesis writers.
POLS 40811	This course is designed to achieve three objectives: (1) introduce you to research and quantitative analysis in political science, (2) help you become critical consumers of political information and policy-oriented reporting, and (3) give you the ability to answer questions of social scientific importance using data. Throughout the course, we'll discuss the complexities of generating good research designs, starting with how to ask interesting questions and how to measure concepts of interest to social scientists. Students in this course will learn to understand the most common statistical techniques used in political science and acquire the skills necessary to use these techniques and interpret their results.  A mastery of these techniques is essential for understanding research on public opinion and voting behavior, electoral studies, and comparative research on the causes of democracy. The target audience for this course is undergraduate students with interest in the social sciences (not only Political Science), who want to use quantitative approaches to solve important problems, as well as develop marketable analytical skills.
POLS 40812	Qualitative Political Analysis introduces the core qualitative methods used in political science. Students will learn about applying the scientific method in qualitative research; the links between theory and evidence; research design appropriate to research questions, including comparing the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative and quantitative research methods; the difference between systematic, evidence-based research and anecdotal work; and important techniques for analysis, inference, and interpretation, including case studies research.  This course can help prepare students to write a thesis in political science, but students do not need to plan to write a thesis for the course to be useful in their other studies and in their post-graduate careers.  This course also serves as one of the core classes in the political science department's methods specialization, but students who are not pursuing the specialization are also most welcome and will find the course useful.  The main goal of the course is to help students build their analytical skills -- to learn how political scientists think but also simply to learn to think better.
POLS 40815	This course is an introduction to political, economic, and social issues through the medium of visual displays. This kind of course has become feasible because data are now abundant and easy to access and software for displaying and analyzing data are available and easy to use. The ability to examine and display data is an increasingly valuable skill in many fields. However, this skill must be complemented by the ability to interpret visual displays orally, and by a commitment to use data responsibly: to reveal, rather than slant or distort, the truth. We will discuss examples concerning drugs, marriage, climate change, development, economic performance, social policy, democracy, voting, public opinion, and conflict, but the main emphasis is on helping you explore many facets of an issue of particular interest to you. You will learn to manage data and produce your own graphics to describe and explain political, social, economic (or other!) relationships. The graphics will include line and bar graphs, 2D and 3D scatterplots, motion charts, maps, and others.
POLS 43002	Writing seminars are devoted to a specialized topic. These seminars give students a chance to take an advanced course in a seminar setting, with an emphasis on research skills and discussion. The individual topic of each seminar can be found on the political science web page listing of course descriptions. The course will fulfill a writing seminar requirement for the major and is restricted to junior political science majors only, but will be opened to senior political science majors after the 2nd day of junior course registration.
POLS 46902	Students on the dean's list are eligible for independent study on a topic of the student's choice, under the supervision of a faculty member.
POLS 47905	This variable credit (0 or 1) course offers undergraduates a chance to learn about and participate in the research experience. After several training sessions, students are assigned to a faculty member to work on an ongoing faculty research project.
POLS 53002	Writing seminars are devoted to a specialized topic. These seminars give students a chance to take an advanced course in a seminar setting, with an emphasis on research skills and discussion. The individual topic of each seminar can be found on the political science web page listing of course descriptions. The course will fulfill a writing seminar requirement for the major and is restricted to senior political science majors only, but will be opened to junior political science majors beginning the 1st day of junior course registration.   
POLS 58902	Seniors with a grade point average of 3.5 or above are encouraged to write a senior honors thesis. For this project, the student works closely with a faculty member on a topic of the student's choice. The senior honors thesis builds on the student's course work, experience, and interests and trains the student to work deeply and independently. Three credits of this two-semester project fulfill one senior writing seminar requirement. The other three credits can count toward elective credit but not toward the major.
POLS 60028	This course will focus on the study of American state politics from a theoretical and empirical perspective. The topics we will cover range widely across those commonly examined in political science, including studies of elections, mass behavior, public opinion, institutions, and policy making. We will focus on how the contextual and institutional factors that vary across states impact the process of democratic governance. The attraction of the states is contextual and institutional variation. It is frequently much easier to imagine meaningful variance existing at the state level compared to the national level. There is only one U.S. Congress, only one President, only one Presidential election at any one time. To generate variance in, for example, the institutional structure of a legislature in order to explore how that structure might shape lawmaking, choices are limited at the national level. We can compare the House and the Senate, but they differ from each other in several ways. How can we be sure which difference(s) really matter? We can compare the House and/or Senate to itself over time, but major changes in these institutions are rare and often occur in response to other important events. We can compare legislatures cross-nationally, but so many other factors vary across countries, and we sometimes face questions of whether units are really comparable. In the American states, we have multiple comparable units that evidence meaningful variation both cross-sectionally and over time. 
POLS 60111	Americans generally conceive constitutional government as limited government. This constitutionalism imposes largely negative duties: its governments are obligated to avoid regulating speech and classifying people by race, for example; they have no constitutional duty to tax, spend, and regulate in pursuit of literacy and racial harmony. As fear of constitutional failure grows in America, reformers focus on institutions and practices like the Electoral College and campaign finance. Few would change the way Americans think about constitutional duty. But some would. Intellectuals of America’s religious right (Adrian Vermeule, Hadley Arkes, Gladden Pappin, Patrick Deneen, etc.) now argue for an affirmative view of constitutional duty – duty to pursue public purposes like economic justice, racial justice, and environmental health. These writers would also use government to promote the virtues of a moral life, especially the sexual morality of the Christian right. This seminar examines the arguments for (1) a common-good constitutionalism generally and (2) the religious right’s version of a common-good constitutionalism. Readings include Vermeule, Common Good Constitutionalism (2022); Steve Pincus, The Heart of the Declaration: The Founders’ Case for Activist Government (2016); Stephen Holmes and Cass Sunstein, The Cost of Rights (1999); articles by Martin Diamond, Martha Nussbaum, John Langan, Michael Zuckert, Steven Macedo, Conor Casey, Randy Barnett, William Baude and Stephen Sachs, and James Fleming and Linda McClain; a few Supreme Court cases; selections from Thomas Aquinas, Locke’s Second Treatise, and The Federalist; and speeches of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt. Course requirements: faithful seminar attendance, active class participation, periodic oral reports on the readings, and a well-reasoned and well-written term paper that observes all scholarly conventions. No midterm or final exam. This seminar is tailored for graduate students in constitutional theory and political philosophy; senior undergrads may join with the instructor’s permission.
POLS 60124	The rationale for studying constitutions in comparative context is that we learn more when we put diverse perspectives into dialogue. Indeed, the most important debates in constitutionalism recur across time and place. Although dozens of countries have confronted similar questions, they often come to different answers. This graduate level course explores different instances of constitutionalism, connecting them to the broader political cultures from which they emerge. We consider the political values and moral theories that inform such concepts as liberty, equality, and community within various constitutional traditions. We will debate such elusive concepts as constitutional identity and amendment. In addition to these big theoretical questions, we explore the similarities and differences of institutional arrangements across systems, including understandings of judicial review, the role of constitutional courts, and varying approaches to constitutional maintenance and change. Ultimately, this course aims at greater understanding of constitutionalism in general and the particular cases of it that we study.
POLS 60205	What are global markets are and how they are governed? The aim of this seminar is to introduce students to empirical trends and academic debates on the political underpinnings of the global economy. We will examine a range of actors involved in the politics of global markets - governments, international organizations as well as a range of private actors. The first part of the class introduces students to recent debates on what global markets are. Readings address trends such as liberalization, globalization and vertical disintegration and we will devote one week to review the main theoretical approaches to theorize global economic governance. The second part of the class meetings is devoted to a range of issue areas that have historically been part of IPE debates, while also introducing a number of themes that are emerging as urgent challenges for the global economy: finance, trade, development, the climate crisis, migration and labor in the global economy. We will also read about emergence of private governance regimes and how they interact with public standards and regulations. In each of these sections, we will think about how institutions, ideas and interests shape local and global economies.  This course serves as a basis for future research in international political economy and prepares students for the international relations comprehensive exam.
POLS 60217	This graduate seminar provides a survey of the philosophic and political theoretical roots of the major  theoretical traditions in contemporary international relations. It begins by exploring in depth the foundational texts in international relations with the aim of considering how they have influenced recent developments and  debates among the key theoretical approaches to international relations (realism, liberalism, and constructivism) with a particular emphasis on identifying the continuity and discontinuity in their central assumptions and causal logics. A second objective of the course is to identify what is consistent and what novel about how we think about international relations theory today.
POLS 60473	This course will analyze the conditions that make democracy and authoritarian regimes more or less likely to be stable and, conversely, that make democratic breakdowns and transitions more or less common. We will also examine some of the conditions that make democratic deepening, stagnation, and erosion more (or less) likely. These questions have long been of central interest to social scientists, historians, and democracy advocates. And they sometimes have huge consequences for the world, as was demonstrated by the aftermath of the breakdown of democracy in Germany in 1933 or by the fall of communism (1989) and the breakup of the Soviet Union (1991). The first part of the course will examine theoretical approaches to studying political regimes, including a few classic works. Part II will include recent work on democratic erosions and breakdowns and on patterns of democratic stagnation and deepening after transitions to democracy. Part III will examine patterns of regime change and stability in authoritarian regimes.
POLS 60477	Across the world, millions of citizens live in territories controlled by criminal organizations that co-exist with democratically elected governments. The spread of organized crime across the globe has followed as many countries transitioned to democracy and/or ended long-lasting civil wars. Increasingly, conflict environments feature criminal gangs, drug-traffickers, mafias, and state actors involved in criminal activities. Informed by prominent theories and methodologies in political science, and the social sciences more broadly, this course will examine the causes of organized crime and its consequences or the consolidation of democracy, particularly in countries in Africa and Latin America. Importantly, a core objective of the course is to identify evidence-based policy approaches to address organized crime in developing countries. More specifically, we will examine theories and methodologies in political science, and related fields, that help us address the following six research questions: 1) What countries are the most and least affected by organized crime? 2) What is the role of politics in criminal violence? 3) How does criminal governance differ from other types of governance? 4) How does organized crime interact with other forms of violence, particularly gender-based violence? 5) In what ways, does organized crime affect democracy? and 6) How have citizens and governments responded to organized crime? In brief, the course will offer an in-depth examination of organized crime and governance through the lens of political science and related fields in the social sciences.
POLS 60661	Augustine of Hippo is an early Christian theologian, whose writings deal with political themes chiefly (though not exclusively) in relation to religion. Augustine’s own polity, the declining Roman Empire of the fourth and early fifth centuries, seems almost entirely “other” than modern political societies. Why, then, has his thought been influential in so large and diverse a body of contemporary ethical and political theory? What is it about Augustine’s reflections on humanity, nature, happiness, justice, and society that makes him seem indispensible many centuries after he wrote, and among scholars of varied faiths and no faith? How do appropriations, revaluations, and critiques of Augustine’s thought help to shape some of the leading political-philosophical work in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries? How compelling are various interpretations of his writings that shape contemporary engagement with his thought? These are some of the questions we will reflect on this semester.  The first two thirds of the course focus directly on Augustine’s ethical and political thought, through a close reading of his City of God. The final third of the course examines Augustine’s use and import in contemporary political thought. Readings for this portion of the course include writings of Hannah Arendt, John Cavadini, Robert Dodaro, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Ernest Fortin, Eric Gregory Alasdair MacIntyre, Pierre Manent, Reinhold Niebuhr, Charles Taylor, and Paul Weithman. Among the many themes open to our consideration, some attention will be given to Augustine’s arguments concerning pride and humility, humanity and love, and philosophy and faith as they impact personal, social, and political life. Also important are Augustine’s interpretations, appropriations, and critiques of ancient historians, statesmen, poets, philosophers, and philosophic schools.
POLS 60810	This course provides an introduction to quantitative research methods in political science.  After a brief discussion of the basics of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, the first part of the course will focus on ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, its assumptions, and its extensions.  In the second part of the course, we will focus on widely-used methods that are appropriate when the assumptions of OLS are violated, and especially on limited dependent variable models.  We will try to strike a balance between theory and mathematics on the one hand and the practical application and interpretation of statistics on the other hand.  We will discuss the theoretical rationale behind and mathematical underpinnings of various statistical methods, how to apply those methods to real political questions, and how to conduct and interpret analyses using a standard statistical package.
POLS 60835	This course introduces students to a range of methodological approaches to generate and gather original data.  The course will highlight &quot;best practices&quot; in research design and implementation, but it will also address the logistical constraints and trade-offs that graduate students face while conducting fieldwork.  Over the course of the semester, all students will develop multiple strategies to build and evaluate their own research questions.
POLS 60843	Political scientists across subfields are increasingly using experimental approaches.  This course covers the design, implementation, and analysis of experiments.  We will discuss both theoretical and practical aspects of experimentation.  Core concepts will be applicable across types of experiments, including lab, survey, online, and lab-in-the-field.
POLS 61001	The American Politics Research Lab provides resources, training, guidance and coordination for research projects in American politics. The lab supports research efforts by graduate students, undergraduate students, and faculty. Regular activities include training workshops, research presentations, question-and-answer sessions, project updates, and special topic discussions.
POLS 98699	Independent research and writing on an approved subject under the direction of the director of graduate studies.
POLS 98700	Required of nonresident graduate students who are completing their theses in absentia and who wish to retain their degree status.
POLS 98701	This class is designed to prepare Ph.D. students for success in finding a faculty position in academia.
POLS 98704	This course is designed to provide a structure for dissertation writing for Ph.D. students who are writing a dissertation or a dissertation proposal employing empirical (qualitative and/or quantitative) methods. We will focus on structuring dissertation and proposal writing and workshopping student chapters and other dissertation-related writing.
POLS 98706	The Political Theory Professionalization Workshop trains doctoral students in Political Theory in the latest approaches to scholarship and research in the interconnected and interdisciplinary fields of political theory, political philosophy, history of political thought, and intellectual history. Students prepare and present presentations based on their doctoral dissertation projects (proposals in progress, chapters in progress, articles or conference papers in progress) and serve as discussants for each other's and visiting speakers' work, and thus experience the peer-review process, by giving and receiving feedback on new work in the field during the weekly seminar. The seminar incorporates the Political Theory Colloquium speaker series, so that doctoral students have a regular opportunity to learn and engage the latest trends in political theory in the wider profession. All Political Theory doctoral students in the 3rd-5th years are strongly encouraged to enroll in this Political Theory Professionalization Workshop for 3-credits per term, unless they are on a fellowship working off-campus. Other doctoral students in the 3rd-5th years who have Political Theory as a second field are welcome to enroll. When the seminar hosts the Political Theory Colloquium, one enrolled student will serve as the discussant for the outside speaker (from Notre Dame or another university), and all enrolled students will be expected to carefully read and engage the speaker's work. When we host an outside speaker for the Political Theory Colloquium, our sessions will be open to the wider Notre Dame community interested in political theory and its cognate fields. 
PPE 43101	A one- or two-credit colloquium required for the PPE minor devoted to the critical reading and discussion of one or two major works, normally taken each semester for three semesters following the Justice Seminar for a total of 3 credits. 
PRL 20804	The primary goal of the course is to introduce students to some of the central thinkers and historical controversies animating the French intellectual scene between the Reformation and the height of the enlightenment in the eighteenth century. Central authors include Montaigne, Descartes, and Pascal; topics to be addressed include skepticism, natural philosophy, and rationalism, and the relationship of these to questions of morals, culture, and religious belief, including divine grace and the role of religious institutions.
PRL 20806	From the beginning of the Abrahamic faiths and of Greek philosophy, religion and morality have been closely intertwined. In this class, we explore to what extent a secular ethical theory is possible. Readings range from antiquity to modernity, including Plato, Kant, Maimonides, Heidegger, and Simone Weil. These authors will help us answering questions, such as, ‘Do I need God’s assistance to become a good person?’, ‘Does the normative power of the moral law require God’s existence?’ ‘Does God need to reveal the moral law in order for me to know it?’
PRL 33122	To imagine is to form a mental concept of something which is not present to the senses. Imagination therefore deals with &quot;framing&quot;. Like everyone else, Africans ponder over their condition and their world on the basis of their experience, history, social location and other realities which provide the &quot;frame&quot; through which they construct and address reality. In this course, through the study of some significant African literary works and some literary works about Africa we will study the self-perception of the African and the way the African has ethically viewed his / her reality and tried to grapple with it over a period of time (colonialism, post colonialism, apartheid) with regard to various issues on the continent (political challenges, religion, war and peace) and over some of the social questions (class, urbanization/ city life, sex and sexuality, relationship of the sexes), etc. We will read such authors as Joseph Conrad, Amos Tutuola, Chinua Achebe, Athol Fugard, Wole Soyinka, Cyprian Ekwensi, Chimamanda Adichie, Syl Cheney-Coker, Tsitsi Dangaremga, Nawal El Sadawi, Ferdinand Oyono , and some others. Using these and many authors we will ask questions about what constitutes the moral imagination, how such an imagination is manifested in or apparent in the social, personal and religious lives of the various African peoples or characters portrayed in these literary works; to what extent the moral sense has helped/ conditioned or failed to influence the lives of these peoples and characters. We will also inquire into the extent and in what ways the writers in our selection have helped to shape the moral imagination of their people. 
PRL 33125	In the wake of the Reformation-era's massive upheavals came the greatest flowering of devotional poetry in the English language. This body of literature offers its readers the opportunity to explore questions pertaining broadly to the study of lyric and to the study of the relationships between religion and literature. Early modern devotional poetry oscillates between eros and agape, private and communal modes of expression, shame and pride, doubt and faith, evanescence and transcendence, mutability and permanence, success and failure, and agency and helpless passivity. It experiments with gender, language, form, meter, voice, song, and address. We'll follow devotional poets through their many oscillations and turns by combining careful close reading of the poetry with the study of relevant historical, aesthetic, and theological contexts. You'll learn to read lyric poetry skillfully and sensitively, to think carefully about relationships between lyric and religion, and to write incisively and persuasively about lyric. Authors we'll read may include Thomas Brampton, Richard Maidstone, Francesco Petrarca (in translation), Sir Thomas Wyatt, Anne Locke, Mary Sidney, Sir Philip Sidney, St. Robert Southwell, S.J., Henry Constable, Fulke Greville, Edmund Spenser, John Donne, George Herbert, Robert Herrick, Henry Vaughan, Richard Crashaw, John Milton, and the great hymn writer Isaac Watts. 
PRL 40823	This course has as its central context the crisis of discursive authority in the modern period both subsequent and consequent to literature gaining its independence from Christianity and its central focus on the different attitudes literature takes towards Christianity on a spectrum that at one end is unrelentingly critical as anti-humanist and at the other affirming of Christianity rather than literature as the true humanism. The reading list includes Camus, Dante, Joyce, Dostoyevski, and Shelley.
PRL 43000	In the Philosophy, Religion, and Literature Capstone Seminar, students in the PRL minor work one-on-one with a faculty member on a capstone project. The capstone project will typically be an essay of at least 25 pages on a topic of the student's choosing which has the approval of the faculty member directing the project and which brings together themes in philosophy and/or religion with literature. In addition to the main advisor, each student will also work in consultation with another faculty member from a different discipline but one also related to the student's interdisciplinary project.  The capstone project will be evaluated by both faculty members.
PS 23000	In this gateway course, we ask: Why are people poor? We take an interdisciplinary look at poverty to better understand the forces that maintain poverty and the forces that resist it. From sustainability to social entrepreneurship, from economics to creative writing, we explore a variety of mindsets and methods for understanding, representing, and assessing poverty. Through academic and experiential learning, we gain a deeper understanding of the public and private programs and institutions that address poverty on the local, national, and global level. We also gain a deeper understanding of what has worked and what hasn't in domestic and international efforts to reduce poverty. Finally, students consider how they are called to address poverty in their personal and professional lives, exploring individual actions and careers that align with their skills and interests related to poverty.
PS 23200	Students will work with a South Bend neighborhood to explore a structural challenge and, with the guidance of a local artist, respond to this challenge alongside community members in creating an artistic piece that serves the good of the neighborhood.

PS 30952	In 1964, when Martha Reeves sang, &quot;Calling out around the world/Are you ready for a brand new beat?/Summer's here and the time is right/For dancing in the street,&quot; was she beckoning listeners to join a party or the civil rights struggle? Or both? From spirituals sung by enslaved workers to protest anthems shouted at union rallies, music has provided the soundtrack to social justice causes throughout American History. Whether performed by rank-and-file reformers or famous recording artists -- from Frank Sinatra to Nina Simone to Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, and beyond -- popular music has accompanied and sometimes fueled transformations in American politics, culture, and social life. In this course students will explore American popular music in its many forms -- blues, country, jazz, folk, rock, punk, disco, hip hop, tejano, and more -- to understand its power and limits as both a force for social change and a window into major themes of the American experience.
PS 33304	Racial Justice in America is focused on the historic and current impact of racial injustice and the urgency of the work of racial justice today.

Students will produce research representing the cumulative weight of their learning in the course and in the minor. They will share a version of their project (research report, work of art, digital resource, poster display, or like) representing their subject mastery at a concluding public forum. This course fulfills the capstone requirement for students in the Poverty Studies minor. 
PS 47003	Lawyer and social justice activist Bryan Stevenson says, “In too many places, the opposite of poverty is not wealth, the opposite of poverty is justice.” This course will ask if that is true and will advance our understanding of how to abolish poverty in the United States. Matthew Desmond’s book Poverty, By America will provide a foundation for our discussion and will prepare us for his visit to Notre Dame’s campus February 8, 2024. Together, we will research programs and practices that have and have not worked to disrupt poverty, including our investment in mass incarceration. And together, we will develop our moral imagination for what could work to create a place where everyone has what they need to flourish and live a just life.   As part of the national Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program, this course involves inside students (people incarcerated at the Westville Correctional Facility in Westville, IN) and outside students (people enrolled at Notre Dame, St. Mary’s, or Holy Cross) learning with and from one another and breaking new ground together.

PSY 30520	An &quot;Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience&quot; is a survey course that introduces students to the biological substrates underlying various forms of cognition in humans, with a specific focus on mental processes. We will explore how psychological and cognitive functions are produced by the brain. Cognitive neuroscience is a branch of both psychology and neuroscience, drawing from disciplines such as biological psychology (biopsychology), neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and neuropsychology.  We will cover a broad range of topics, including learning and memory, perception, development and neural plasticity, cerebral lateralization and language, emotions and social cognition, stress, sleep and dreaming, and consciousness. No previous coursework in neuroscience is required, but at least some experience with biology or biopsychology is preferred.
PSY 30537	Inflammation is a fundamental biological phenomenon - whether it preserves or destroys is often a matter of context. In this course, we focus specifically on neuroinflammation - i.e., inflammation as it relates to the central (and peripheral) nervous system. We begin with the founding principles of molecular and cellular immunology in the context of the human nervous system. Next, we will explore the biological, environmental, and human components of (neuro)inflammatory disease through clinical case studies and representations in literature and media. Finally, we ask: how do medical, healthcare, and pharmaceutical constructs define the sociocultural experience of disease? Thus in this class, we integrate the scientific and the social: How do humans, how does humanity at large, deal with (neuro)inflammation? Can we firefight our collective future? This course is open to all majors. Strongly recommended prerequisites: Biology I: Big Questions (BIOS10171) OR Neuroscience and Behavior (BIOS20450) OR Cell Biology (BIOS30341) OR Cellular Biology: Stem Cells to Disease (BIOS30410)
PSY 30541	In an age where ‘identity politics’ figures as both an accusation and a creed in public and private spaces, a careful and critical examination of how we construct our individual and collective selves is more important than ever. Science and technology are crucial resources in these projects, serving as fundamental structuring elements of our world. They are crucial in shaping not only our physical environment but the very conditions of possibility within which we construct our collective and individual identities. This course is an exploration of the ways that the practice of science and the production and marketing of technology supply the material that gets taken up in the project of identity formation, focusing on two closely linked technoscientific domains: neuroscience and genetics.
PSY 30635	Long Title: Drunk on Film: The Psychology of Storytelling with Alcohol and Its Effects on Alcohol Consumption.     Alcohol Use Disorder is a chronic relapsing brain disease. But when presented on screen, it's entertainment. Why do we laugh, why do we cry, why do we emulate fictional characters whose drinking habits result in a life of debilitating addiction? From James Bond to Jonah Hill, the psychology and seduction of alcohol on film, television, and online will be analyzed.  Furthermore, what is the relationship between the manner in which alcohol use/abuse is presented on screen and the manner in which alcohol is used and abused on, for example, college campuses? Surveying recent film history, we will examine how alcohol is used in story structure, as a character flaw or strength, and as a narrative device in the story arc of films across multiple film genres, (action/adventure, comedy, romance, etc). Why do characters drink, where do they drink, and how does the result of their &quot;getting drunk&quot; advance the narrative? We'll also look at non-fiction films that tackle issues of addiction, as a way of comparing character development in Hollywood films to the results of this same behavior in everyday life. Film materials will include weekly screenings outside of class, and academic articles relating to portrayal and analysis of alcohol use in film and television, including the business of marketing alcohol in print and television advertising. From the psychological perspective we will discuss the topic and process of social influence and how the presence of others influences our behavior. Questions of interest will include the following: what are the mechanisms by which group influence unfolds? How and why might we be persuaded? Does the manner, and if so how, in which alcohol use is portrayed in movies and the media reflect the processes and principles of social influence? Readings will include chapters on social influence, persuasion and academic articles evaluating the manner in which alcohol is portrayed and advertised and the effect this has on alcohol consumption. In addition, issues of addiction will be discussed - from understanding the basis of addiction to examining the efficacy of addiction treatment.
PSY 30676	The purpose of this course is to provide students with experience in various aspects of programming for video game development.

They will share a version of their project (research report, work of art, digital resource, poster display, or like) representing their subject mastery at a concluding public forum.
PSY 30696	This course explores the interaction of thinking and action for justice, of cognitive science and social change. In this contested moment, how might we examine the ideas with which we think as we envision social transformation and work toward solidarity and the common good? We will draw from psychology and neuroscience to understand how to overcome attribution errors, implicit bias, and motivated reasoning in work to promote justice. We will examine how assumptions about knowledge and our theories of mind impact our communication and work, and explore epistemic justice (who is invited to the table of knowledge). We will explore, in seminar format, means to promote intellectual humility, ethical imagination, practical wisdom, and commitment to action. Students will be encouraged to learn through experience and community engagement, and apply the lessons of the course in their own journeys.

PSY 47809	The Senior Thesis requires a year-long investigation on an original topic of study under the tutelage and mentorship of a faculty member.   It must result in a substantial written product that will be evaluated by the thesis advisor.  Any senior psychology major may undertake a Senior Thesis provided that the student is in good academic standing and has secured the approval of a faculty mentor.  Faculty members may consider other academic qualifications as a condition for supervising a thesis, such as GPA, performance in certain courses, experience in a research lab, relevant background experience, favorable letters of reference and compatible scholarly interests.
PSY 60101	The second semester of the required sequence focuses on experimental design and analysis of variance as a method for investigating mean differences among groups, whether or not the groups are formed experimentally. The course begins by developing principles for assessing the validity of various types of experimental and non-experimental approaches for investigating psychological phenomena. This semester continues the model comparison theme developed in the first semester by showing how questions of mean differences can be conceptualized in terms of various statistical models. Special emphasis is placed on repeated measures designs, including the multivariate approach to data analysis.
PSY 60111	The second semester of the required sequence focuses on experimental design and analysis of variance as a method for investigating mean differences among groups, whether or not the groups are formed experimentally. The course begins by developing principles for assessing the validity of various types of experimental and non-experimental approaches for investigating psychological phenomena. This semester continues the model comparison theme developed in the first semester by showing how questions of mean differences can be conceptualized in terms of various statistical models. Special emphasis is placed on repeated measures designs, including the multivariate approach to data analysis.
PSY 60123	The linear model plays a central role in the analysis of data within the social and behavioral sciences. Thorough understanding of the underlying theory is therefore a cornerstone of Quantitative Psychology. The course is based on the book &quot;Linear Models in Statistics&quot; by A. Rencher (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics) and will cover the necessary matrix algebra, quadratic forms, simple and multiple regression with a focus on estimation and hypothesis testing, and simple ANOVA models. This is a theoretical course designed to provide students in the quantitative program with necessary basic knowledge concerning linear models. This knowledge will serve to better understand commonly used specific types of linear models such as factor analysis and structural equation models.
PSY 60152	This course is designed to acquaint students with item response theory (IRT). It will begin with a brief review of classical test theory (CTT), and then presentation of popular models, their estimation, and proper interpretation, and then continue reinforcing these lessons throughout the semester with examples of test data. At the end several important applications of IRT will be discussed, such as test or item equity among different ethnicity groups.    Specifically, the following topics will be covered in this class: basic theory, models for handling both dichotomous and polytomous response data, parameter estimation, IRT software and goodness of fit, applications of IRT to test development, equating, differential item functioning, computerized adaptive testing, and personnel selection and so on.
PSY 60155	The first reading in this course is a book chapter by John Nesselroade describing two fundamentally different ways of conceptualizing change: change in individual differences or individual differences in change. The former can be studied by such techniques as multiple regression and standard longitudinal applications of structural equation modeling, but the latter requires a different approach. In particular, this course focuses on multilevel models (i.e., hierarchical linear modeling, or HLM) as a methodology for studying individual growth and individual differences in change.
PSY 60260	In this course we will examine selected aspects of socioemotional development during adolescence and adulthood.  Within these broad age outlines, the course will also have a lifespan emphasis.

ROFR 30605	From country pastor to cathedral villain, from merciful bishop to weaselly lecher, the image of the Roman Catholic priest in French culture is nothing if not versatile. But what purpose does that versatility serve? Is the image of the priest simply all things to all people as a matter of utility, an easy target - for good or for ill - that provides to authors, artists, or directors a shortcut to a good laugh or to a character that their audience will love to hate? This course will explore the image of the priest in France from the Middle Ages to the present day in its varied manifestations in literature, film, and art. We will examine what the broad spectrum of representations reveals about the state of the French Church at any given moment in history, about the theology of the priesthood, or about clericalism and anticlericalism in a political or social context. In a moment when the meaning of the priesthood in the Catholic Church and beyond continues to be contested, a study of the French context will yield a deeper understanding of the priest and his role as an embodiment of the Church and its authority. Taught in English, with course materials available both in English and the original French.
ROFR 33360	In this course, under the guidance and supervision of French Studies faculty and the University Archives, students will transcribe and translate (French to English) the letters sent and received by Father Edward Sorin between the years 1839-1893.

ROFR 40223	This course will constitute an in-depth examination of the French lyric tradition primarily during, but not limited to, the sixteenth century. Students will begin by exploring the Italian origins of the French tradition before tracing its development through the Rhetoriqueurs, the Ecole lyonnaise, the Pleiade, and beyond. Through a close analysis of primary literary texts and through exposure to some salient works of secondary literature, students will not only engage the poetry but also broader questions about imitation, originality, and meaning during a dynamic but somewhat unstable period of literary production. Taught in French.
ROFR 40715	The nineteenth century saw the rise of print media and professional institutions. Old-fashioned whisper networks came to be viewed suspiciously as a dangerous, “feminine” pastime for those without lives of their own. Yet the enduring popularity of gossip—in society columns, romans-à-clef, communal laundry rooms, and political caricatures—meant that informal social networks thrived, fueled by a heightened interest in the private lives of famous people. The learning goals of this class extend beyond those of textual analysis and the researched argument to media literacy. Following several scandals across a variety of sources, we will study how information was transmitted via different genres, spaces, and voices in nineteenth-century France, looking at a range of texts from broadsheets to Offenbach operettas. While reinforcing social mores, gossip also provided a means of resistance to the status quo, a way for the marginalized to reframe official narratives and point to the humanity shared across classes and identities. Taught in French.
ROFR 40940	This course focuses on literary works in French that have received illustrious prizes, from the Nobel Prize to the Prix Goncourt, and it examines questions related to the prestige of publishing houses and the role of marketing techniques meant to package and sell books alongside questions of influence and imitation, and of possible accusations of plagiarism. The course’s tripartite emphasis on the ways in which authors and their textual creations are celebrated, circulated, and questioned is complemented by an analysis of how these award-winning attempts to decolonize literature in French constitute a contemporary quest with profound historical and intertextual resonances. We read literary works of a great variety, including novels by Nobel prizewinning authors Annie Ernaux (the first Frenchwoman ever to win this award in 2022) and Jean-Marie Le Clézio, Goncourt prizewinning authors Mohamed Mbougar Sarr (the first Sub-Saharan African to win this award in 2021) and Leïla Slimani, as well as works by other writers who are caught up in telling striking stories that involve intersecting understandings of the complexities of race, class, and gender that have too often been missing from the literary landscape in French.

ROFR 60300	This course is designed to further develop the student's conversational skills and grasp of a wide variety of styles and registers in French. Spoken French will be practiced through various types of classroom activities and assignments. Whether it is a general discussion in the class, smaller group conversations, or debates where students learn how to efficiently defend their opinion on a given topic, there will be many opportunities for everyone to express themselves in French. Every week, students will choose a topic that will be discussed through various materials. Current events, French films, books, paintings, social issues, political events, social protests, diversity, ecology, and many other topics that agitate the Francophone world will be discussed. Speaking the language rather than focusing on the purely theoretical aspect of it makes for a different learning style. Taught in French. Pre-req: ROFR 20202 or 20215 or a CEFR score between 401 and 500.

Taught in French.
ROFR 63115	This graduate seminar, taught in English, explores the forms, functions, and stakes of a pervasive literary form in French and Occitan literatures from ca. 1150 to ca. 1500: debate literature. From the university classroom to the courtroom and from idyllic orchards to battlefields, debates offered a heuristic for participants and listeners to engage in controversy, put their virtuosity on display, and spark continued reflection on the relationship between self and thought. With a focus on courtly literature, we will examine how debates were set up, performed, and judged, teasing out some of the recurring stakes of this literary tradition. The ability to read in French is necessary, although English translations will be made available where possible.

ROIT 20650	In the intricate and interconnected society of the Late Middle Ages in the Mediterranean Basin (12th-15th Centuries), the short story emerged as a dominant literary genre, transcending cultural and geographic boundaries. The Mediterranean’s bustling commercial networks served as a conduit for stories, knowledge, and people, bridging distant shores.  During this era, Italians held sway as the Mediterranean’s foremost commercial and naval power, a dominance reflected in the multitude of short story collections written from the 12th to the 14th Centuries. Figures like Giovanni Boccaccio, Franco Sacchetti, and Giovanni Sercambi skillfully portrayed the sociological, geographical, historical, and psychological intricacies of this cultural crossroads.  The short story explored diverse themes, including courtly love, the Crusades, the interplay of the three Monotheistic Religions, class struggles, varied perspectives on women’s roles from Spain to the Arabic domains, and encounters between different cultures. This genre provided a window into the era’s multifaceted facets.  This course aims to delve into the historical tapestry of the multiethnic and multicultural Italian peninsula during the Late Middle Ages.

We will focus on key issues that unveil the unique &quot;spirit&quot; of modern Italy, such as the weight of the past, the tension between political realism and idealism, the recurrence of social and political crises, immigration, revolution, and youth culture.  We will investigate how issues of gender, class, race, identity, and faith have shaped Italian literature, film, and theatre in the modern age. Through the study of texts, films, and other media, the course seeks to understand the development of modern Italy and its future trajectory. Authors studied will include Dario Fo, Natalia Ginzburg, Eugenio Montale, Elsa Morante, Anna Maria Ortese, Luigi Pirandello, Igiaba Scego, and Elio Vittorini.

ROIT 40370	The passage from the nineteenth to the twentieth century was a period of great hope but also of great anxiety all over Europe. While nobody could predict the coming of the First World War that would shortly engulf the continent, pre-apocalyptic restlessness dominated public discourse and culture, especially in the young nation of Italy.  Modernity delivered many and promised ever greater improvements in living conditions, but it also laid bare its contradictions: social inequalities, political conflict and polarization, and the abyss of existential emptiness and angst, which afflicted so many and so much.   From poetry to fiction, from theater to visual arts, we will study how the great Italian authors of this period like Nobel Prize winner Luigi Pirandello, Gabriele d’Annunzio, Giovanni Pascoli, Antonio Fogazzaro, Italo Svevo, Guido Gozzano, Federigo Tozzi, Filippo T. Marinetti and the Italian Futurists defined and bore witness to the transformations of the modern era. Some prospected a societal collapse and yearned for a rebirth accelerated by avant-garde aesthetics, while others indulged in the decadent beauty of an impending end. Some engaged in a melancholic longing for the past, while for others, progress could happen only through its annihilation. For those who escaped into individualistic introspection, the crisis of the self could be a psychological journey through torment or a template for personal and spiritual actualization.   The contradictions of Italian literary Modernism cemented Italy as a uniquely rich culture, that fused a millennial historical tradition with a constant tension towards self-transformation and innovation: moving forward while looking backward. We will explore these tensions, which live on to this day: progressivism with reactionism, nationalism with cosmopolitanism, regionalism with immigration, capitalism with socialism, pacifism with warmongering, religion with secularization and existentialism, to see why the turn of the century left an indelible mark on the Italian culture for the centuries to come.

ROSP 30715	Since its first uses in the Sixteenth Century, the term utopia meant both &quot;good place&quot; and &quot;no place.&quot; Thus, the concept carried two different ideas in its own meaning, an ideal society and an unreachable one. In the past years, the concept—as well as its opposite, dystopia—has been applied to explain literary representations of imagined worlds that hold a mirror up to our own &quot;real&quot; world. Analyzing and discussing cultural products that create, depict, and represent invented societies is, without a doubt, a good path to understand and to critique key aspects of this complex world we live in today. In this class, we will study Early Modern Hispanic texts (written by Late Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque authors) as well as contemporary fictions (films, short stories, plays) that have in common their way to create and describe imagined/utopian/dystopian universes.  We will pay specific attention to descriptions of imagined places in order to see how they explore real tensions around class, gender, society, religion, racial identities, imperial subjects, and power. During the semester, we will read texts written by Cervantes, Colón, Lope de Vega, Tirso de Molina, Cortés, Gracián, Vespucio, Nieremberg, and Fuentelapeña and will watch and analyze films such as Children of Men, Blade Runner, Pan's Labyrinth, Avatar, Elysium, among other contemporary works.

ROSP 30845	We have recently witnessed a wave of debates about monuments (statues of military figures, explorers, conquerors, rulers, etc.). Moreover, many of those monuments have been intervened, &quot;vandalized&quot; moved, covered, and even topped down, fueling a series of controversies that invite us to reflect about the constantly shifting politics of memory and about the political effectiveness of pursuing symbolic justice in the public space. This is a Cultural Studies undergraduate research seminar devoted to a selection of important public monuments in Latin America; this is, statues, monoliths, and architectural visual signs that attempt to memorialize historical events and people as well as cultural and political values. We will examine their history as well as their paradoxical semiotic fate: no monument is able to install the memory it pretends to make eternal. Monuments are floating signifiers destine to be appropriated, re-signified, toppled down, and, eventually, forgotten.
ROSP 30871	This course focuses on understanding literary expressions of luxury and natural resource extraction in South America. Through a reading of colonial, modern, and contemporary texts, we will explore the representation of the acquisition, manipulation, and circulation of natural resources and their derivatives within and from South America.

The course also seeks to develop the skills of writing, critical analysis and teamwork to generate informed opinions that students can communicate effectively. The course is taught in Spanish.
ROSP 36000	Specialized reading related to the student's area of study.
ROSP 40431	This course offers an introduction to some of the recent thinking and cultural phenomena on the Anthropocene. Although we will pay particular attention to the Iberian Peninsula and contemporary Spain in particular, we will ultimately attempt to come to terms with our current geological and civilizational epoch as mainly humanly driven. For that purpose, under examination and question will be primitive accumulation and Capitalism, humanism and posthumanism, rural depopulation, consumerism, energy use, industrial relocation, technology (social networks, smartphones, big data, Google, etc.); droughts, wildfires, human and planetary finitude, etc. This discourse will combine literary and cinematographic studies with conceptual perspectives that will ultimately seek to bear witness through thinking and the arts to the Anthropocene, if such thing is still possible. Taught in Spanish. 
ROSP 40440	This course studies how contemporary Iberian literature and culture is trying to come to terms with the coming of “Surveillance Capitalism;” namely, a new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction and sales. Thanks to Google, Apple, Facebook, Netflix, etc., this “Surveillance capitalism” could be also understood as an economic and societal logic in which the production of goods and services is subordinated to an unprecedented global architecture of behavioral modification (Heidegger, Stiegler, Zuboff, Balibar, etc.). Ultimately, we will ask what kind of civilization the third modernity of technics and surveillance foretell, and we will explore how literature and culture bear witness to the subsequent shifting of the fundamental inherited notions of modernity such as: human self-representation and artistic expression, progress, social bond, sovereignty, freedom, planetary finitude, inequality, as well as to the new discontents of civilization. We will combine literary and film studies with conceptual perspectives. Taught in Spanish.
ROSP 40720	The goal of this undergraduate seminar is to analyze Latin American literature in the cultural-historical period of the so-called &quot;modernizing impact,&quot; which covers the last two decades of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century and is commonly known as Modernismo. The journey will focus on the birth of the genre of the modern chronicle, a hybrid zone between literature and journalism, between information and imagination, between politics and the market. In Latin America, this complex object has brought together numerous critical perspectives that read local modernization against the backdrop of global modernity, whether as a dyschronic modernity (Ángel Rama), a disconnected modernity (Julio Ramos), a peripheral modernity (Beatriz Sarlo), a dissonant modernity (Gwen Kirkpatrick), a translinguistic modernity (Julio Ortega), or a modernity in translation (Mariano Siskind). From the discussion of these fundamental perspectives for the study of the field, specific prose texts by Rubén Darío, José Martí, Julián del Casal, and Julio Herrera y Reissig will be addressed. The chronicles of modernity will serve as a platform to reflect on current and relevant problems in literary studies, such as the representation of American cities, the crisis of modern subjectivity, the tension between the Eurocentrism of global modernity and American nationalisms, migratory processes, the phenomenon of secularization, the emergence of mass culture, the transition from the model of the &quot;nineteenth-century literary man&quot; to that of the &quot;professional writer,&quot; the role of translation, and the assimilation of cultural traditions foreign to the Latin American sphere.
ROSP 40775	This course invites the students to explore the issue of identity as it is lived and thought by a number of Hispanic Caribbean thinkers and artists (essayists, playwrights, film makers, poets, and performance artists). We will pose the following questions: Is &quot;identity&quot; a useful concept for thinking about the culture of a nation, territory, region or community? How are the following factors used in identity politics or in the project of thinking identity: landscape and place, history (heroic history, the histories of suffering), the body, sacrifice? We will consider essays by Fernando Ortiz, Antonio Benítez Rojo and José Esteban Muñoz; poetry by Virgilio Piñera, Nicolás Guillén and Reinaldo Arenas; performances by Ana Mendieta, Carmelita Tropicana, Tania Bruguera and Carlos Martiel. All class discussions in Spanish. This course satisfies the modern Spanish-American area requirement.
ROSP 40781	The first waves of feminism in South America during the late 19th and early 20th century were led by many women in the medical profession. Julieta Lanteri and Sara Justo in Argentina, Ernestina Lopez in Chile, or Paulina Luisi in Uruguay, to name a few, claimed for women's rights in terms of health and hygienism. At the same time, medicine emerged as a dominant and masculinized discourse within the nation-states that sought to control women's and non-binary bodies and behaviors. In the 20th and 21st century, medical discourse was also in the center of feminist debates about motherhood, reproductive rights, obstetric violence, among others. This course will explore the connections between medicine and feminism through the life and works of women writers and activists from South America, from the late 19th to the 21st century. We will read fictions, essays, journal articles, and medical treatises from the 19th and 20th century and debate on the role of medical knowledge in the context of recent feminist movements. Theoretical readings include Donna Haraway, Michel Foucault, Teresa de Lauretis, and numerous scholarly works on feminism, the history of medicine, and gender and sexualities in South America (Salessi, Lavrin, Marino, Guy, Ben, among others).
ROSP 40845	We have recently witnessed a wave of debates about monuments (statues of military figures, explorers, conquerors, rulers, etc.).

Monuments are floating signifiers destine to be appropriated, re-signified, toppled down, and, eventually, forgotten.
ROSP 40893	This course centers Blackness within latinidad. In it, students will learn about the history of Blackness in Latin America, and how that history continues to shape the experiences of AfroLatina/os in the US today.

We will analyze literary and cultural works by AfroLatina/os with roots in Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panamá, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Perú. This is a CBL course and students will volunteer at La Casa de Amistad once a week. Open to non-Spanish majors who are fluent in Spanish or are Spanish heritage speakers.

ROSP 63235	In this seminar we will study one of the most relevant phenomena of the Spanish baroque society: the comedia. During the semester we will read one comedia per week trying to reproduce the sensory and intellectual experience of the spectators of the Spanish territory in the 17th century. We will work with a diverse and heterogeneous corpus of authors. We will read canonical comedies and other little-known ones which have contributed to shape the Spanish subjectivity of this historical period. The main objective of the class will be to reconstruct the Iberian cultural field and thus understand the importance of theater in this society. We will discuss key concepts of the baroque era, highlighting productive critical intersections with signifiers such as power, subjectivity, sovereignty, representation, race, gender, violence, rebellion, control, transgression and empire.

We will analyze proposals for the remedy of the demographic catastrophe and the colonial government of the population from figures as diverse as Fray Pedro de Córdoba, Fray Antón Montesinos, Juan López de Palacios Rubios and Fray Bartolomé de Las Casas. These proposals include the regulation of indigenous labor, its humanitarian and rational exploitation; policies related to nutrition and days off work; hospitals for natives; the repopulation of the islands with Spanish farm workers; the promotion of miscegenation; the creation of agrarian communities; and even the importation of African slaves and the enslavement of the Caribs. The class will reflect on the complexities and contradictions inherent in these early attempts at a biopolitical formulation of colonial government.
ROSP 63909	This seminar introduces graduate students to the modern history of Latin America, from independence to the present. We will question the idea of “Latin America”—as a teaching category of analysis in relation to the “West” and the “Global South”—and study a selected number of themes that have shaped our understanding of the region, from liberalism and rising notions of state formation to competing interpretations of anti-imperialism, mestizaje, revolution, populism, conservatism, Catholicism, feminism, the Cold War, and neoliberalism.  While an effort will be made in covering various countries in the region, the attention will be placed instead on some of the most recent scholarship on the modern history of Latin America. We will read and discuss the methodological differences in this expanding literature, question the limitations that continue to center a US-based position in the study of the region, and place our discussions in conversation with key primary documents, including manifestoes, speeches, short films, and literary texts that represent competing ideological perspectives as well as various points of view on class, gender, ethnicity, and race.   Upon completion of the course, students will be well prepared to teach a Latin American history survey, map out the various methodological approaches that scholars of the region have developed over the years, explore a focused theme for their doctoral dissertation projects, and identify the foundational texts for their Ph.D. exams, not only in history, but also in Romance Languages, Literature, and other disciplines.

RU 33101	In 1987, the Soviet Union was the largest political entity on the planet. Four years later, it had vanished from the map entirely. In this interdisciplinary course, you will learn about the ‘new Russia’ that has emerged in the three decades since this stunning collapse. Drawing on an array of resources in English translation, you will explore the politics, media, and culture of the post-Soviet period: from the lawless years of the “wild 90s” under Boris Yeltsin to the return of totalitarianism under Vladimir Putin and his brutal invasion of Ukraine. In so doing, your study of contemporary Russia will lead us to discuss some of the most pressing questions in global politics today. What is the nature of truth and power in Putin’s dystopian propaganda state? Should the current leadership in Russia be described as a fascist regime or neo-Soviet? And, perhaps most importantly, how did Russia’s democratic experiment ultimately end with the launch of the largest war in Europe since 1945—and what lessons might this failure hold for America and the rest of the world?

SCPP 48498	Participation in research
SEI 30552	Social Entrepreneurship has sparked dialogue and debate for two decades. Its very definition is much debated, as well as its capacity to create sustainable, scalable, systems-changing impact. This course explores the theoretical concepts, practices and strategies associated with the dynamic discipline of social enterprise and innovation. For our purposes, social entrepreneurship is the landscape, of which paradigm-shifting solutions like microfinance, MSME (Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise) development, bottom of the pyramid, fair trade, impact investing, and the like, are components. This course will study many of these concepts, focusing on their opportunity for social impact, and as a vehicle for wealth creation in vulnerable and disenfranchised communities across the globe. Further, the course covers examples of various social enterprise models (for-profit, non-profit, hybrid), requiring students to analyze and devise strategies to improve the efficacy of these ventures. Finally, the course engages students in research seeking to advance the field of social entrepreneurship at the Keough School of Global Affairs and Notre Dame.

SMAC 20401	On July 1, 2021, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) granted to Division I student-athletes the right to commercialize (i.e. make money from) their Name, Image and Likeness (NIL). The goal was to provide student-athletes with the same rights their non-athlete student peers have long enjoyed: the ability to earn compensation in exchange for their NIL by, for example, endorsing a product, selling their autograph, or giving sport lessons.   One year after NIL legislation went into effect, the NIL landscape continues to evolve and change, leaving many confused about how to navigate these new opportunities. In this course, students will develop an understanding of: 1) what Name, Image and Likeness opportunities look like in real life, 2) the relevant NCAA, legal and policy guidelines, 3) the personal and environmental factors that can influence how people choose to engage in NIL activities, 4) their personal motivations, interests and goals related to NIL opportunities and, 5) the resources available to help them maximize their NIL opportunities while at ND.   Students will be evaluated based on their engagement with guest speakers, collaboration with one another, and their performance in presentations, quizzes and a reflective essay.
SMAC 20402	The National Football League is a multi-billion-dollar enterprise intricately interwoven in the ever-changing fabric of our nation's socioeconomic, political, and cultural norms.  Although fans see the nice shiny end product on Sunday afternoons, behind the glimmering LED screen, there are a multitude of factions, each with a seat at the table and its own dogmatic agenda, engaged in a tense, combative game of high-stakes liar's poker.  This course will deconstruct the NFL machine and examine the key players involved in forging and fueling this cultural phenomenon.  We'll analyze and discuss a variety of current topics and events all within the context of the back and forth, give and take, tug of war dynamic between NFL players, teams agents, coaches, media, brand partners, and front office personnel.  We'll also examine the impact of recent league initiatives designed to foster meaningful change in the areas of social justice and reform.  Through a transparent, wide-angled lens, we'll provide our students with a nuanced perspective and appreciation for the complex inner-workings of the NFL community and the foundational value of industry relationships rooted in servant leadership.  The breadth and depth of experiential knowledge will encourage and empower practical and innovative application in the new millennium as our students explore career and community service opportunities at both the macro and micro-levels of professional sport.

SMAC 30103	With help from athletes such as Billie Jean King, Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James, Serena Williams, and Megan Rapinoe, Americans are growing accustomed to thinking about sports as embedded in the politics of gender, class, race, sexuality, and the nation. Consider the variety of places where sports happen, however, and the ways we develop and consume those places, and it becomes apparent that sports are also environmental in significant and complex ways. This course will examine the environmental politics of sports from conservation to climate change through the lenses of history and cultural studies. Course content will range from 19th century hunting, Indigenous surfing, and BASE jumping, to pick-up basketball, pro stadiums, and Notre Dame Athletics. Topical sections include outdoor sports and conservation, mountain sports and public land use, parks and recreation, stadiums and environmental justice, sports and climate change, and sustainability in the NCAA. Course requirements include regular reading and discussion, midterm and final essays, and a research project on a topic of the student's choice.
SMAC 30106	A generation ago, students looking to pursue careers in media were likely journalism or broadcasting majors who could aspire to master one platform and work for the same news company for decades. No more. People don't consume news in the ways they once did; the media landscape is changing. There are new challenges -- how to regulate misinformation, how to fund big investigative projects -- but also new opportunities. Digital tools are eliminating ‘start-up' barriers and giving storytellers more control over their fates. Aspiring news writers or producers no longer need to work their way up in a legacy company, hoping to someday catch their big break. You could manage a YouTube channel with thousands of subscribers from your dorm room. Some of you probably already do. But how do you monetize such ventures? How do you turn a side project or a cool idea into a career? In &quot;Media Entrepreneurship,&quot; we'll explore how you can combine your passion and skills - skills cultivated as a student of the liberal arts -- to capitalize on media's exciting new frontier. You'll gain the knowledge, tools, and confidence to see &quot;being your own boss&quot; or &quot;launching your own brand&quot; as a realistic career possibility. And it's not just about you. When you hear the word &quot;entrepreneur,&quot; you might think of a guy pitching an idea to venture capitalists on Shark Tank. But, at its best, media entrepreneurship is an act of service. It's about building trust, meeting community needs, and expanding whose voices we hear as a society. In this course, you'll practice conceiving of a media project and creating your own startup business plan.
SMAC 30111	Game Day Media will delve into the preparation and performance of game day media opportunities: play by play personnel, color analysts, Public Address talent, news conference moderators and more.

SMAC 30112	This course aims to change the way you think not only about the way that we play games, but also about the way that video games teach their players to behave within their digital worlds. This course will encourage students to reflect on and utilize their lived experiences as players, and utilize these experiences to locate themselves within their analysis and writing as well as their design practices. This course will undertake an intensive, interdisciplinary focus on the history of video game development, representation in video games, and the languages that digital games work in as well as decolonial theory and diverse theories of design. This class will engage with a variety of scholarly texts, video games, media posts, videos, and design exercises, in order to illustrate the ways in which video games have shaped the ways we play, think, and behave within their spaces. Students will be required to write and design around these lessons and address and push back against the problematic behaviors and colonial narratives around violence, race, gender, sexuality, and relationship to the land that these gamic languages and lessons have created.
SMAC 30301	In this course, students will study the history of boxing in the United States and learn a great deal about the craft of boxing, what commentators have called &quot;the sweet science.&quot; They will do so in conventional and innovative ways. The course will explore the story of boxing in America from the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries. It will start in England and colonial America, move to places like nineteenth-century New York, New Orleans, and the California mining camps where boxing was transformed from a gambling pursuit among the working class into a mass spectator sport, examine the time when boxing became ascendant in America, and end in the late twentieth century when boxing was entangled with urban decay and changing race politics. The story of boxing is the story of America. The class will look at the rise of cities, mass migration, changing understandings of race and class, urban history, and the fortunes and misfortunes of postwar American culture. Now for the innovative. Students will also learn about the finer points of craft, how training for boxing changed over time, and how technique developed. They will do so by doing it themselves. They will learn to throw a punch and to defend. They will practice footwork. They will train as boxers did and still do. By doing all this, students will come to appreciate the finer points of a dynamic and changing sport, one tied to America's past. Each class session will include this sort of active learning, turning what we learn from reading and discussion into the kinetic.
SMAC 30303	This course aims to accomplish the following: 1) to develop students' understanding of the Cold War and its major political developments; 2) to develop students' understanding of the ways sports and society influence and reflect political developments; 3) to see sports programs as a reflection of the nation-states in which they develop, and to use athletic traditions in different nations to develop students' understanding of different societies; 4) to improve students' ability to use contemporary periodical sources in historical research; and 5) to improve students' analytical reading and writing skills through readings, exams, and a paper.
SMAC 30304	In the modern world, sports and sport-like spectacles are a source of livelihood, entertainment, and social interaction for huge swathes of the global population. Fans and practitioners of physical feats of strength were likewise a major component of ancient Greco-Roman society, from the earliest Olympic Games at the dawn of Greek history to the gladiatorial contests and chariot races that characterized the most decadent phases of the Roman Empire. The purpose of this course is to provide an interdisciplinary examination of the origin and nature of sport and spectacle in the Classical world and to compare the role that athletics played in ancient society to the position it occupies in our own lives - from the point of view of athletes, spectators, and patrons alike. Topics covered will include: Near Eastern precursors to Greco-Roman sport; the development of Greek and Roman sport and spectacle through time, the Olympic Games; the role of religious thought in ancient sport; the position of the athlete within society; ancient and modern rewards for athletic valor; athletes in architecture, literature, and art; and the political appropriation of athletes and athletics. The course will focus mostly on formal athletic contests in ancient Greece and on athletic spectacles in ancient Rome, but general recreation and physical education will be considered as well.
SMAC 30605	Why do weight lifters wear lifting belts? How does athletic training and diet differ between endurance athletes and strength athletes? What are the sex-based differences in athletic performance? What impact do supplements and performance enhancing drugs have on athletic performance? Through the use of peer reviewed research, popular media articles, podcasts, and film we will answer these and many other questions within the field of exercise physiology. The course will be split into two broad units: 1) Powerlifters and 2) Marathoners. Topics covered will include cellular metabolism, muscle physiology, training programs, response to training, basic nutrition, body composition, some methodological exercise testing, supplements and performance enhancing drugs, recovery, fatigue, and activity in extreme environments. Through this use of mixed media, we will also discuss how the media misrepresents and misreports exercise physiology studies, making us all more discerning consumers of information.
SMAC 30702	How do the contemporary film and television industries work? How can an analysis of the &quot;business of entertainment&quot; enable a greater understanding of contemporary media aesthetics and culture? This course will explore these questions by focusing on the structure, practices and products of America's film and television industries, and students will engage with academic readings, screenings, trade publications, current events, guest lectures, and written and oral assignments in order to understand the activities of the film and television industries. By the end of the course, students should be able to understand prominent practices employed by media conglomerates and independent companies today, recognize the ways in which industrial structures and practices can shape media products, and examine how television shows and movies are influenced by business strategies. The course should be especially beneficial for students intending to pursue scholarly or professional careers related to film and television through its comprehensive overview of how these industries work, why they work as they do, and the broader practical and theoretical implications of media industry operations.
SMAC 30703	The Game, as we experience it on screens big and small, is an ever evolving story. A human competition turned into a visual narrative by producers, directors, and broadcasters. How is that three hour ebb and flow of emotions turned into an engaging narrative for fans? How has that story evolved over decades? How has the evolution of technology changed that story? And has the televised broadcast changed the meaning of the game itself? From the Super Bowl to March Madness, ESPN Sportscenter to WWE Smackdown, we'll dissect the process, storytelling techniques and technology that form the American sports story on television, as well as experience the actual game production operation from inside the control rooms of Notre Dame Studios. Assignments include on-camera and off-camera production exercises, as well as written assignments deconstructing historical and current broadcasts. No prior television production experience required.
SMAC 30704	It has long-been a part of Notre Dame’s Saturday football tradition. As uniformed players leave the locker room and descend a tight stairwell to the field below, they reach up and touch the iconic “Play Like a Champion Today” sign. Countless players, students, and fans have touched the sign over the years, hoping to imbibe some illusive and ineffable Fighting Irish magic. But what does it mean to “play like a champion today” … or any day, really? More simply, what does it mean to play? Play is an inescapable and essential part of the human condition. And, yet, the experience’s core liminality defies easy definition and explanation.  This course provides an introduction to the study of human play primarily through the lens of analog and digital games. Given the variety of play practices across human history and cultures, this class strives to equip students with a critical vocabulary and interpretive framework to help them make sense of play in its many forms. This class will pay particular attention to how rules, goals, game mechanics, and narratives offer reliable and compelling structures for gameplay, and what ludic activities reveal about human culture and social power.
SMAC 30903	In this course, we will challenge the single story/ies U.S. schools and curricula have told about books, characters, contemporary issues, and cultural groups by focusing on literature by and about people from various populations that have been traditionally underrepresented in the United States. We will discuss young adult literature from parallel cultures (including possible works by and about African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino/as, Native Americans, Middle Eastern Americans, and other ethnic groups), as well as literature by and about populations traditionally defined by class, ability, religion, gender and sexuality. Furthermore, this literature often tackles sensitive contemporary topics that are not typically and explicitly discussed in schools, such as racism and privilege, sexual assault, climate change, and the opioid crisis. Course participants will investigate theoretical perspectives, issues, and educational implications for these texts in society and in the educational system. As an extension of the course, we will also examine the young adult literature market and how contemporary media may reinforce or resist the stereotypes and single stories associated with these cultures.
SMAC 45901	This is an academic internship.   This is a collaboration between the Department of Film, Television, and Theatre and the Department of American Studies that will provide a unique professional experience to the right candidate. Must be an Sports, Media, and Culture minor.
SMAC 46920	Directed reading taught by individual faculty members.  Permission required.
SMAC 47909	Capstone projects synthesize and reflect upon the student's work within the minor in some public-facing way. They ask students to contribute to public discourses on sports, media, and culture. Each student will plan and develop a project with the help of the director and a faculty or staff mentor. Capstone projects may build from a course, senior thesis, internship, research project, or service program, or they may be a separate project. Capstone projects should reflect the student's academic and professional interests, and may take a variety of forms such as a public poster presentation or talk, online digital humanities project, curated museum or library exhibit, print journalism, podcast, video, or the organization and introduction of public programming such as a panel discussion, film screening, or visiting speaker.
SOC 10002	What are the influences that shape who we are and how we think? Why do people act the way they do? How can we better understand why people's lives take certain paths? The answers to these questions are central to our well-being as individuals and as a society. In this course, you will learn how sociologists approach and answer these questions. During the semester, you will explore our society through a variety of lines of inquiry. What is the link between individuals and their culture? How is social interaction structured and how does this affect our behavior? What is inequality? How do institutions influence our lives?  The over-arching purpose of the course is to cultivate your &quot;sociological imagination,&quot; which can then be used to better understand yourself and your place in the larger world.
SOC 10033	The United States is beset by many serious social problems, such as crime and deviance, drug abuse and addiction, domestic violence, hunger and poverty, and racial/ethnic discrimination. How do we think about these problems in ways that lead to helpful solutions?  Sociology offers concepts, theories, and empirical research useful for understanding and addressing important problems in society. This course illuminates key social problems by introducing basic sociological concepts, theories and research, and applying them to specific problems, such as poverty and economic inequality, racial segregation, gender and educational inequality, and the decline of social capital. Students will learn to take a sociological perspective not only in examining the causes, consequences, and solutions to some of society's most troubling social problems, but also in developing their critical analysis of key social problems.
SOC 10342	The family is often agreed to be the primary and most fundamental of social institutions. It is within this institution that early socialization and care-giving usually take place, and therefore, many of our ideas about the world are closely tied to our families. This course will give students the opportunity to learn about the diverse forms the family has taken over time and across different groups. This knowledge will be useful in examining the ongoing debate about the place of the family in social life. By taking a sociological approach to learning about the family and by gaining knowledge about national family trends and patterns in the U.S., this course will give students the theoretical and empirical tools for understanding how family life is linked to the social structure; to economic, cultural, and historical events and transitions; and to societal factors like race, class, and gender.
SOC 10502	We live in a society populated and dominated by organizations. Throughout our lives we engage with many different types of organizations: hospitals, schools, businesses, government agencies, religious institutions. It has been argued that the very essence of modern society is the rise of large scale formal organizations, which can help us by creating efficiency, predictability, and fairness, but can also trap us in an iron cage of numbing bureaucratic rationalization.  The objective of this course is to help you analyze and assess the good, bad and ugly about modern organizations. It specifically aims to provide analytical tools and case studies to help you: 1) understand how different kinds of organizations function 2) assess organizational effectiveness and failure, and 3) evaluate the role of organizations in a globalizing world. Broadening our understanding of organizations can facilitate our ability to both negotiate our way through organizations and, perhaps most importantly, try to change them
SOC 10722	The overarching goal of this course is to provide students with a working knowledge of social psychology and, with that knowledge, to increase awareness of ourselves, the social world around us, and the connections between the two.  This is a course about social interaction - how the self shapes and is shaped by others, how we interact in and with groups and social structures, and how we perceive the world around us. Because the subject of the course is the very social interactions in which we are immersed, it is expected that students will develop the habit of applying social psychological concepts to everyday life.
SOC 10732	Introduction to Criminology provides students with an overview of the sociological study of law making, law breaking and the resulting social responses. In this class we not only look at a variety of crimes, but we also discuss the varying methods sociologists use to collect, interpret and evaluate data, as well as how we theorize about crime and punishment. We address questions such as &quot;Why are some people or groups labeled as criminal, while others are not?&quot; &quot;Do laws in both their construction and enforcement serve everyone's interests equally?&quot; &quot;How can the communities in which people are embedded be considered as criminogenic?&quot; &quot;How are poverty, race, gender and other social factors related to crime?&quot; 
SOC 13181	An introduction to the seminar method of instruction accenting the organization and expression of arguments suggested by readings in sociology.  Each of the seminars treats a particular sociological topic, such as family life, social problems, the urban crisis, poverty, etc.

SOC 20033	The United States is beset by many serious social problems such as educational inequality, extreme poverty alongside unparalleled abundance, crime and deviance, health disparities, mass incarceration, and the persistence of discrimination along lines of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, class, gender, and sexuality. Course materials are designed to engage student learning, illustrate the distinctive features of the sociological perspective, and to start you thinking sociologically about yourself and the broader world. To think sociologically requires you to recognize that our contemporary world, with its enduring cultural, political, and economic institutions, is as much a social product as we are. In this course, students will learn to take a sociological perspective not only in examining the causes, consequences, and solutions to some of society’s most troubling social problems, but also in taking a critical look at their own perceptions of problems.
SOC 20342	The family is often agreed to be the primary and most fundamental of social institutions.

SOC 20806	We are living through a watershed moment in United States history. Structural racism is at the forefront of the national discourse. Yet, the threat that racism holds on our nation's most cherished ideals of democracy and justice is hardly new. Generations of activists, scholars, and everyday people have fought and persevered to bring about social, cultural, and policy change. This course engages deeply with topics relevant to the national discourse on racial and ethnic relations in the U.S. The first part of the course examines key concepts, focusing on the social construction of race and ethnicity, prejudice, and discrimination. The second part reviews the historical experiences of Native Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans. The third and final part of the course centers on four critical issues that are especially relevant in 2020: (1) immigration; (2) political disenfranchisement; (3) racial and ethnic disparities in health; and (4) racism in the criminal justice system.
SOC 30119	This class will survey the various historical and contemporary dimensions of Asian American experiences including immigration &amp; integration, family &amp; community dynamics, ethnic/gender/class identity, as well as transnational and diasporic experiences. We will explore contemporary and historical issues of racism, the model minority myth, inter-generational relationships, and the educational experiences of Asian Americans. To accomplish this, our class will pose such questions as: Who is Asian American? How did racism create Chinatown? Is there an Asian advantage? Coursework includes essays based on topics of your choice, presentations, and a creative narrative.
SOC 30145	This course offers a critical examination of what it means to be an immigrant or child of immigrants through scholarly works, memoirs, blogs, and popular journalism. Since the liberalization of immigration policy in 1965, immigrants from Latin America and Asia are becoming an increasing and emergent demographic of American society. In major American cities such as Los Angeles and New York, they comprise over 50% of the population. This course focuses on how immigrants and the children of immigrants experience the United States. How are immigrants changing the US racial and ethnic structure? How do their experiences differ given varying legal statuses? How is the second generation becoming American? We will explore these questions through readings that focus on family, religion, education, dating and sexuality. This course will include a community based learning component where students will work with immigrant serving organizations. Students will have the option to teach citizenship classes or to work with immigrant children. Service will be 2-3 hours per week outside of class.
SOC 30900	Sociology 30900 is a course that is meant to introduce the undergraduate students who enroll, most of whom are majors in sociology, to the origins, development, and uses of sociological theory. In that pursuit, the course seeks to explain how theoretical ideas emerge, how perspectives are framed, and how vantage points for viewing society and its operations shift over time. To achieve these ends, special attention is devoted to prominent thinkers, both &quot;classical&quot; and contemporary, in the history of social thought, from the early critics of modern industrialism like Karl Marx to ironic commentators on present-day social practices such as Erving Goffman.  &quot;Foundations of Sociological Theory&quot; is also a &quot;writing-intensive&quot; course in the liberal-arts curriculum. This means that students in the class, at the same time that they are reading and studying theory, will work on improving their skills as writers of clear, objective, and persuasive prose.    
SOC 30902	Sociology 30902 is designed to provide an overview of research methods in the social sciences. Topics covered include (1) hypothesis formulation and theory construction; (2) the measurement of sociological variables; and (3) data collection techniques - experimental, survey, and observational. At the end of the course, students should appreciate both the strengths and the limitations of sociological research methods.
SOC 30903	We frequently encounter statements or claims based on statistics, such as: &quot;Women earn less than men,&quot; &quot;The American population is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse,&quot; or &quot;Married people are healthier than unmarried people.&quot; On what information are these statements based? What kinds of evidence support or refute such claims? How can we assess their accuracy? This course will show students how to answer these sorts of questions by interpreting and critically evaluating statistics commonly used in the analysis of social science data. Hands-on data analysis and interpretation are an important part of the course. You will gain the skills to conduct quantitative data analysis using a statistical software package.  You should finish the course with the ability to interpret, question, and discuss statistics accurately and with an understanding of which type of statistic is appropriate for different kinds of data and research questions. No prior statistical knowledge is required. This course is ideal for students interested in the social and/or life sciences as well as business and/or law.
SOC 33090	This course provides an introductory overview of the sociology major and the opportunities students have within the Sociology Department and the Arts and Letters College, as well as across the University. The course has a practical focus. Some classes are devoted to equipping students with knowledge and skills that will serve them as they progress through the major. Other classes focus on future plans, such as entering the work force, going on to graduate or professional school, and performing service after the baccalaureate. The idea of &quot;career as vocation&quot; is also explored. This course is for one credit, pass/fail, and is required of all sociology majors.
SOC 35900	In the Sociology Research Apprenticeship course (SOC 35900) students gain experience working on a faculty member's research project.  This opportunity offers students the chance to acquire practical knowledge about the sociological research process as well as to begin developing sets of skills necessary for conducting fruitful sociological research. Students will also be encouraged to develop ideas for their own independent senior thesis project during their time in the apprenticeship.  Students in this course must fill out an application to be considered. At the beginning of each semester, the Director of Undergraduate Studies sends an e-mail to all Sociology majors with a list of the available research projects along with instructions on how to apply for them. All Sociology majors are eligible. (This course is for one credit and is repeatable; the grade structure is S/U.) Department approval required. 
SOC 40050	In many of the recurring conflicts around the world, at issue are demands for justice.  Whether these revolve around economic inequality, political repression, environmental devastation, civil and political rights, ethnic or religious exclusion, or discrimination on the basis of race, class, gender, sexuality or disability status (to name just a few), social movements are often the carriers of these calls for justice.  In this course, we will examine how social movements emerge from, contribute to, and suggest resolutions for various types of social conflict, as well as explore their potential contributions to sustainable peacebuilding.  We will examine theory and research on how social movements emerge, escalate, consolidate and decline; how they choose (and change) protest tactics; how they articulate their visions and goals; how they generate emotions, solidarity and commitment; how they interact with networks of allies, opponents and powerholders; and how they influence (or fail to influence) agendas, policies, and regimes.  We will put a particular emphasis on the comparative study of social movements in different regions of the world, as well as on the challenges and opportunities posed by transnational movements that seek to organize across borders.
SOC 40416	What is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict about? How did it start? How might it be resolved? Some interpretations rely on claims of ancient hatreds. Others invoke sacred and biblical narratives as their authority for claims to a land deemed holy by many different religions. Still others underscore the ills and legacies of settler colonialism and indigenous accounts of historical presence. Some invoke international law and human rights to make their claims. This course will explore these arguments surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through screening and discussion of cinematic representation, narrative argument, and documentary films. Multiple genres provide powerful tools to introduce students to multiple perspectives, conceptions of history, experiences of injustice and grievances and loss, and imagining peace and justice. Each screening will be paired with relevant and interdisciplinary reading material. The students will emerge from this course with a detailed and complex understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the present dating back to the late Ottoman period, the British control of historic Palestine, and the definitional moment of 1948 which is marked both as Israeli independence and the Palestinian catastrophe (the Nakba).
SOC 40555	 Although advances in science and technology have made tremendous gains in promoting health and longevity, these achievements have not been experienced evenly. Instead, devastating health and disability-based inequities persist, such as environmental racism and disability-based discrimination. As a result, social movement groups and organizations are fighting to protect vulnerable communities and promote civil rights. This class will therefore address how social movements have impacted the health and human rights of vulnerable social groups in the US and beyond today. To do so, we will (1) use a sociological perspective to investigate the structural determinants of health and the social construction of disabilities, and (2) investigate how advocates, activists, and organizations fight for good health and disability justice. This course will require participation in a daylong multi-fieldsite visit, weekly readings, presentations, and a final paper.  
SOC 40881	What does it mean to be Latino and who should be in/excluded from that category? Are Latin@s a “race’ or an “ethnicity” or an “ethnorace” or something else? Should we even be using “Latino”? Or should we use labels like Hispanic, Latino/a or Latin@? What about “Latinx” or “Latine”? And what do these different questions tell us about the lives of the more than 62 million people in the US who personally or whose parents and ancestors once lived in places as far-reaching as Mexico, Cuba, Argentina, and perhaps even Brazil and the Philippines? This course aims to answer these questions by examining research, journalism, and media that elaborate on how race and ethnicity are constructed within US histories and systems of discrimination, prejudice, nativism, etc. Students will study empirical patterns and theoretical discussions on Latin@ immigration, panethnicity, political behavior and mobilizations, and interactions with US institutions. In exploring theory and patterns, this course will emphasize how racial-ethnic inequality shapes Latin@ life, both between Latinx@s and other groups (like Asian, Black, and white Americans) and amongst Latin@s. We will also explore how racial/ethnic inequality intersects with other social categories and systems, including gender and social class. Students will further explore the potential futures of Latin@ populations in the US.
SOC 43585	Sociologists who study social movements and activism typically address questions about how disadvantaged groups are able to organize and engage in sustained protest in hopes of bringing about progressive change.  In recent years, however, we have witnessed the growth of many organizations that aim to prevent change with hopes of preserving benefits that they enjoy.   To understand this form of organized resistance to change, we need to closely examine how power operates in society to understand conditions that give rise to activism that resists progressive change.  We consider the extent to which theories designed to explain progressive activism fail to account for conservative activism.  The ultimate goal for the course is to provide you with the tools needed to formulate your own research questions and to engage with the academic literature to theorize your questions in a way that could lead to publishable research. 
SOC 43590	Economic actions like working, buying, selling, saving, and giving are a fundamental part of everyday life, and all spheres of society, from family to religion to politics, are interrelated with economy.  Sociologists examine how social relationships from small networks to transnational linkages affect economic actions and their outcomes, and the ways cultural meanings and political strategies shape those social relationships.  The goal of this class is to provide students with new perspectives on economic actions by reading recent sociological studies of topics like money, markets, work, businesses, industries, and consumer society.
SOC 43787	Given the dramatic rise in mass incarceration over the last 50 years, understanding the spillover consequences of this uniquely American phenomenon has become increasingly important as a growing number of families now have direct experience with imprisonment. This course will provide a broad overview of the ripple effects of mass imprisonment on family life and how it shapes opportunity and structures disadvantage for communities, families, and especially children. This will be done through 1) exposure to mixed-media portrayals of imprisonment's effects on family and community life and 2) the close analysis of empirical research on the spillover and intergenerational consequences of incarceration across a range of outcomes. With the concentration of imprisonment falling among poor, minority families, much of the readings in this course will focus on family life in urban communities of color, however, we will spend a little time exploring broader accounts, including those of rural communities and encourage students to consider impacts for families exposed to incarceration due to white-collar crimes.
SOC 43818	When people think about sexuality, they often adopt a biological view - seeing sexuality as &quot;driven&quot; by hormones and nature. This course adopts a different approach by viewing sexuality through the lens of sociology - as shaped by social processes, including social interaction, institutions, and ideologies. The course will focus on examining three sociological aspects of sexuality: 1) The social, historical, and cultural factors that shape sexual behaviors, desires, identities, and communities; 2) The ways in which sex and sexuality are constantly regulated and contested at multiple levels of society, including within families, schools, workplaces, and religious and political institutions; and 3) The sources, causes, and effects of sexual inequality. While our focus will be on sexuality, we will also study how other identities (including gender, race, class, religion, etc.) influence and affect it. Students will be encouraged to question their taken-for-granted assumptions about sex and sexualities and to formulate critical perspectives on issues pertaining to sexuality in today's public discourses. This course is sex-positive in that it assumes that knowledge about sexuality is empowering, not dangerous. The readings and discussions will be frank, and students will be assisted in developing a language for and comfort level with discussing a wide range of sexual topics in a respectful and sociological way. In the process, students will be challenged to improve their critical thinking, researching, writing, and public speaking skills.
SOC 45000	The Sociology Internship[ is a community-based learning course designed to give students some practical experience in the area of urban affairs, social welfare, education, health care, or business, in order to test their interest, complement their academic work, or acquire work experience preparatory to future careers.  Students are placed in a community agency in the South Bend area and normally work seven hours per week as interns under the supervision of an experienced practitioner. Scheduling hours is a flexible process in order to accommodate the intern's availability and the needs of the host agency. While there are no prerequisites, preference is given to Sociology majors, ALPP or SCPP majors, PSIM minors, and students who have had course work in an area related to social concerns. This is a graded course. In addition to field work, academic work includes reading scholarly works related to the field placement, periodic group meetings with the instructor and others in the course, periodic short reports, and a final paper. Departmental approval is required.   The following is a list of agencies that have accepted interns. Students may also request placement in an agency they find on their own (subject to approval by the instructor).   La Casa de Amistad Salvation Army of St. Joseph County (Social Services) Sex Offense Services of St. Joseph County (must complete paper work and training a semester in advance)  Early Childhood Development Center  Good Shepherd Montessori School Robinson Community Learning Center Upward Bound College Preparatory Program, UND  AIDS Assist Center for Hospice &amp; Palliative Care, St. Joseph County (usually requires two-semester commitment) Sr. Maura Brannick Health Center at Chapin Street  The CASIE Center (Child Abuse Services, Investigation &amp; Education)  Family Justice Center Indiana Legal Services
SOC 46000	Directed Readings in Sociology offers a student the chance to work closely with a member of the faculty on a topic that is not available through any of the regularly offered courses. This independent study course allows for the student, under the guidance of the faculty mentor, to draw up a reading list and study plan for in-depth reading throughout the semester. The student is responsible for periodic oral and/or written reports and at least one major paper. To qualify for this course, a student must have a GPA of at least 3.5 in Sociology. A formal application is required. Students should have a clear idea of the topic they want to pursue and the faculty member they have asked to direct them before requesting a copy of this form from the Director of Undergraduate Studies. This is a graded course, no exceptions. Department Approval Required. (Before department approval is given, the student must have the application signed by the faculty member, the DUS in Sociology, and an Assistant Dean in the A&amp;L Undergraduate Studies office.)
SOC 48000	Directed Research in Sociology offers students a chance to engage in hands-on research, either by working on a faculty member's research project or by pursuing one's own research question unrelated to a senior thesis project. By the end of this course, students should demonstrate a deepened sense of empiricism and methodological understanding. This is a graded course, and a formal application is required. (See the DUS for a copy.) Students engaged in a faculty member's research project should work out a study plan and evaluation process for assigning a final grade with the faculty member. Students engaged in their own research project should (1) submit their research questions, hypotheses, data source, and methodology to their faculty director at the time of application to the course, and (2) submit a written research report by the end of the semester, as part of the final evaluation process. Department Approval Required.
SOC 48009	The Sociology Senior Thesis is a two-semester course where students are required to complete an original research project under the direction of a faculty advisor. Additionally, the Senior Thesis is a clearly and precisely written polished document, therefore writing is central to the process. Students are required to meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies before registering for the class. The Thesis fulfills two of the required 40000 level classes and is required for all students on the Honors Track
SOC 61997	This is the lab for the Linear Regression Course.
SOC 63092	The main goal of Proseminar II is to expose students to the substantive areas of strength in the department.  Representatives from each area exam committee in the department will coordinate a series of presentations on the overall intellectual landscape and cutting edge issues in their area.
SOC 63120	The Culture and Theory workshop supports student and faculty work by 1) discussing work in progress, 2) developing skills around theorization and argumentation, and 3) offering support for professionalization in these fields. Our definitions of culture and theory are necessarily broad and cross-disciplinary. The workshop is appropriate for students from any sociological subfield, and participants need not self-identify as &quot;theorists&quot; or &quot;culture people&quot; in order to substantially involve their work through participation. Our community is even open to papers that might not have a cultural or theoretical dimension but that might benefit from one.
SOC 63279	Most sessions of the CREO Seminar feature a presentation of educational research by an invited speaker from off campus or by a Notre Dame faculty member or graduate student. The content of the presentation is discussed and students write a brief reaction. Other sessions are devoted to a discussion of chapters in the Handbook on the Sociology of Education. The seminar runs for both semesters during the academic year and students receive three credits for the entire year. In the spring semester this course is two credits.
SOC 63578	Seminar for graduate students conducting research in the areas of politics and social movements. The course focuses on presentation of on-going research projects and structured feedback about those projects. Participants will also read and discuss recent contributions to the social movements literature.
SOC 63691	This one-credit workshop will engage students with key pieces of literature related to empirical research, measurement, and data analysis in the sociology of religion; teach some alternative approaches to basic data analysis strategies in the sociology of religion; and provide an informal seminar-based context for the collective reading, discussing, and critiquing of each others' scholarly papers in sociology of religion. Workshop readings are drawn from the reading list for the ND doctoral exam in sociology of religion, to also help facilitate preparation for that exam.
SOC 63810	This 1-credit course is a training seminar for graduate students who are interested in and/or are conducting research in the area of race &amp; ethnicity. The course aims to do the following things: 1) create a safe, stimulating, and structured space for the discussion and development of research agendas focused on race and/or ethnicity; 2) provide opportunities for students and faculty to present and receive constructive feedback on on-going research projects interrogating aspects of race and/or ethnicity; and 3) provide opportunities for students and faculty to engage with scholars doing research in the area of race &amp; ethnicity from outside of Notre Dame. 
SOC 63820	Throughout our lives we participate in and interact with many different types of organizations: hospitals, schools, businesses, government agencies, religious institutions.  However, our understanding of these organizations is often limited.  We may see what they do, but it is often difficult to see how organizations do these things and why they do them.  Broadening our understanding of organizations can facilitate our ability to both negotiate our way through organizations and restructure organizational activities.  The objective of this course is to increase your ability to understand today's organizations by (1) exploring different ways of looking at and thinking about organizations and (2) developing your skill at &quot;reading&quot; real organizational situations.  Because today's organizations are multi-faceted entities we will look at organizations from many different angles: as machines, organisms, brains, culture, political systems, psychic prisons, instruments of domination, and as flux and transformation.  Throughout the course active learning is stimulated by organizing class sessions around discussions of cases (including video cases) and using cooperative learning groups.  Upon completion of the course you will be able to (1) analyze organizations from multiple perspectives and (2) imagine alternative ways of organizing activities.
SOC 63822	In this workshop, we will help both faculty and graduate students revise and refine works-in-progress: early manuscripts, articles under review, conference papers, dissertation chapters, grant and fellowship proposals, practice job talks, etc. Authors will circulate their work in advance, and workshop participants will read the paper prior to the workshop. During workshop, the author will briefly introduce the paper and outline any questions or concerns in need of group guidance. We welcome scholars whose research has primary or secondary relevance to gender, sexuality, or family. You need not identify as a gender scholar in order to participate. We also welcome researchers who are interested in developing gender as a theme in their research. If you are wondering how gender can be more than a control variable in your analysis, or how to theorize gender in your research context, you would be an excellent fit for the workshop.
SOC 63826	This graduate-level seminar is designed to introduce students to the sociological study of stratification and inequality. Although the course will survey a range of classical and contemporary work, particular emphasis will be placed on students becoming active participants in current areas of sociological research. Orienting questions include: What does a distinctively sociological perspective have to contribute to the study of social inequalities? How do social institutions -such as schools, neighborhoods, labor markets, and the criminal justice system -(re)create categorical inequalities along lines of social class, race and gender? What is and should be the role of sociological research in promoting a more just and equitable society?
SOC 63922	This graduate seminar is an intensive overview of major currents of American and European theory that continue to have a strong influence in contemporary research and thinking in sociology. In particular the course focuses on lines of thinking in the sociological tradition that begin &quot;after the classics,&quot; roughly from the post-war era in Europe and the United States to the present.  A strong background in classical social theory (SOC 63911) is strongly recommended as a pre-requisite for this course.  As defined here contemporary theory includes currently relevant strains of &quot;neo-classical&quot; theory ( including neo-Marxian, neo-Weberian and neo-Durkhemian traditions), theories of symbolic interaction and micro-interaction emerging from the American pragmatist and post-functionalist traditions, contemporary re-interpretations of mid-twentieth century action theory and early twentieth century pragmatism, and current reinterpretations of utilitarian theories (e.g. rational action theory and methodological individualism) for application to sociological problems.  We will also deal with post-classical lines of scholarship of European provenance (such as structuralism and field theory) as well as American network theory. Lines of theory that used to be influential but which have declined in influence or are no longer relevant will not be considered here (the course is not an antiquarian history of ideas, but is designed to prepare the student to be conversant with theoretical scholarship that is actually used in contemporary empirical work).
SOC 63977	Ethnography Workshop will work with faculty and graduate students to develop projects using ethnographic and other qualitative methodologies. The workshop is a place to cultivate projects' methodological and theoretical aspects. It is also a place to work on analysis and developmental writing.  Finally, this workshop will also help authors revise and refine ethnographic projects for publication. Participants will circulate their work in advance. Workshop participants will read circulated analysis and writing. During this workshop, presenting authors will briefly introduce their work and outline any questions or concerns in need of group guidance. We welcome ethnographers and qualitative researchers from various departments and institutions.  
SOC 63980	How does one conceive and execute a qualitative research project?  In this seminar we will learn this process through developing and carrying out independent research projects.  We will cover: using the literature to identify interesting and important qualitative questions, grounded theory and theory reconstruction approaches to building research projects, interview and ethnographic methods, and preliminary aspects of qualitative data management and analysis.
SOC 63997	In this course, students will learn the mathematics underlying &quot;Ordinary Least Squares&quot; (OLS) regression, as well as the practical applications and interpretation of the OLS model. The course will cover the following topics: interpreting regression parameters; generating predictions; properly specifying models; assessing model fit; finding the correct functional form; testing for statistical significance; interpreting interaction terms and non-additive models; and evaluating numerous modeling assumptions.  Further, we will deal with extensions of this framework, some which address limitations of OLS. Examples include: multilevel modeling, and factor analysis. Throughout the semester, students will use the Stata software package to estimate, test and interpret linear models. Successful completion of the &quot;Statistics Bootcamp&quot; (or equivalent) or the approval by the instructor is necessary for enrollment in this course.
SOC 78599	Reserved for the six-credit-hour thesis requirement of the master's degree.
SOC 98200	This course is a required course for graduate students who have completed 8 years of study.
SOC 98699	For resident graduate students who have completed all course requirements for the Ph.D.
SOC 98700	For non-resident graduate students who have completed all course requirements for the Ph.D.
STV 10115	The course will provide a survey of relationships between man and microorganisms. General information about microbial physiology, biochemistry, and ecology will support more detailed discussions of interesting topics in food, medical, and applied microbial biology. Included will be subjects of general and historical interest, as well as current newsworthy topics. The student should get a better understanding of the role of microorganisms in disease, the production of common foods, relevant environmental issues, and biotechnology. This course counts as general elective credit only for students in the College of Science. 
STV 10119	Evolution is the cornerstone of modern biological sciences. This course will highlight evolution as well as ecology and biodiversity. Emphasis will placed on the evolution of animal behavior including human behavior. Sexual selection and its role in shaping many forms of life, including humans, will be extensively covered. Open classroom discussion is a central and required part of the course. 
STV 20101	This course will introduce students to fundamental ethical and social issues related to the design, development, and use of technology. Students will develop an understanding of philosophical ethical theories as a resource for analyzing how technology impacts both individual and collective civil, political, and human rights and issues related to autonomy, privacy, and identity, as well as how it reinforces power dynamics in society and its impacts on equity, justice, and fairness. Specific topics will include bias and fairness in algorithms, privacy, data governance and civil liberties, surveillance and power, social media, and the ethics of artificial intelligence.
STV 20111	&quot;Hacking&quot; is one of the most pressing topics of technological and societal interest. Yet, it is one of the most misunderstood and mischaracterized practices in the public sphere, given its ethical and technical complexities. In this course we will combine anthropological and computer science methods to explore the digital tools, practices, and sociocultural histories of hacking with a focus on their context of occurrence from the late 1960s to the present. Our goal is to help students think anthropologically about computing as well as technically about the digital mediations that we depend on in our lives.
STV 20202	Design thinking has emerged as a powerful methodology to catalyze breakthrough innovation for an array of complex business, social and humanitarian challenges. Business and industry have embraced design thinking as one of the most potent drivers of innovation, growth and prosperity for its’ deeply human-centered approach to problem solving. During this fast paced, hybrid, hands-on journey through the design thinking process, students will immerse themselves in a series of overlapping modules that introduce the various phases in the design thinking process and familiarize students with the tools and techniques. This course will unleash your creativity and ingenuity in addressing problems through a human centered framework and mindset, applying this methodology to a vast array of human-centered problems, and complementing disciplines from science and engineering to business and the liberal arts. This course fulfills a Core Curriculum Liberal Arts 4 Way of Knowing (Arts) as well as the gateway to the Collaborative Innovation minor and cross-listed with other minors including: Sustainability, Computing &amp; Digital Technologies, Education, Schooling &amp; Society, Entrepreneurship and Anthropology.
STV 20204	This course introduces students to the field of social-cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropologists are primarily interested in exploring issues of human cultural diversity across cultures and through time. This course will explore key theoretical, topical, and ethical issues of interest to cultural anthropologists. We will examine diverse ways in which people around the globe have constructed social organizations (such as kinship, and political and economic systems) and cultural identities (such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, race, and class) and we will consider the impact of increasing globalization on such processes. Throughout the course we will consider how different anthropologists go about their work as they engage in research and as they represent others through the writing of ethnographies.
STV 20255	In an age where ‘identity politics’ figures as both an accusation and a creed in public and private spaces, a careful and critical examination of how we construct our individual and collective selves is more important than ever. Science and technology are crucial resources in these identity formation projects, serving as fundamental structuring elements of our world. They are crucial in shaping not only our physical environment but the very conditions of possibility within which we construct our collective and individual identities. This integration course is an exploration of the ways that the practice of science and the production and marketing of technology supply the material that gets taken up in the work of identity formation, focusing on two closely linked technoscientific domains: neuroscience and genetics.  
STV 20300	This course examines the topic of global environmental change and the mechanisms by which global change occurs. Analysis will include the relationships between physical and ecological changes on Earth, and our current understanding of how climate evolves under natural and human influences. Topics covered include the global energy balance, structure and circulation of the atmosphere and oceans, climate variability, and implications of climate change for natural and human systems.
STV 20306	Discussion of basic chemical processes occurring in the environment, particularly those relating to the impact of humanity's technological enterprise.
STV 20311	What are the cultures of medicine? How does belief create possibilities for healing? How do cultural, social, and political forces shape experiences of illness? When can care be a form of violence? How can histories of oppression make you sick? Medical anthropology is an expansive field of research concerned with the study of medicine, affliction, and healing in historical and cultural context. This course provides an introduction to topics in medical anthropology, from classical texts on belief, illness experience, and structural violence to contemporary work on disability, care, and critical global health. Over the course of the semester, students will gain experience in methods, critical thinking, independent research, and public communication as we collectively explore what medical anthropology can contribute to the urgent health challenges that we face in the contemporary world today.
STV 20331	Introduction to Criminology provides students with an overview of the sociological study of law making, law breaking and the resulting social responses. In  this class we not only look at a variety of crimes, but we also discuss the varying methods sociologists use to collect, interpret and evaluate data, as well as how we theorize about crime and punishment. We address questions such as &quot;Why are some people or groups labeled as criminal, while others are not?&quot; &quot;Do laws in both their construction and enforcement serve everyone's interests equally?&quot; &quot;How can the communities in which people are embedded be considered as criminogenic?&quot; &quot;How are poverty, race, gender and other social factors related to crime?&quot;
STV 20556	Science and technology play a powerful role in structuring our world, in everything from our physical environment to our culture.  It is thus imperative that we understand how these entities work. What constitutes reliable knowledge? How do the technological systems in which we are embedded throughout our lives come to be, and how can they be changed? In this historic moment of a global pandemic playing out against a backdrop of fake news, alternative facts and increasingly autonomous technologies, these questions are more critical than ever.     This course introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of Science &amp; Technology Studies in order to provide them with analytical and conceptual tools needed to confront the complex questions that arise where science and society intersect. Its objective is thus not so much to present a particular body of empirical information as it is to equip students with the analytical skills to understand complex multi-dimensional phenomena. The purpose is to give students both the opportunity and the tools to consider science and technology in a broader political, social, historical and economic context, and to reflect on how the practices of scientific and technological development shape their own individual and collective experience. 
STV 20600	This course will introduce students to scientific illustration and visual documentation through basic drawing skills and techniques utilizing traditional and contemporary art approaches, media and tools. Students will learn to create representational renderings through close and careful observation of natural subjects including botanical, animal, insect and/or aquatic life based on field observations, study at the Museum of Biodiversity and other sites as available. Medical illustration and microscopy drawings are also potential subjects to be explored. Emphasis will be on accuracy, form and structure as well as integrating personal vision through developmental, conceptual and compositional sketches and exercises leading to several completed drawings and include a field journal and sketchbook. Students do not need any prior drawing experience and can be pursuing any major!
STV 20601	Measurement is a fundamental activity in modern science, both the natural and social sciences. While measurement is often considered as the hallmark of science that makes an activity “scientific,” there is little consensus among philosophers about how to define measurement, what kinds of things are measurable, or which conditions make measurement possible. By engaging with texts that build on concrete practices of measurement in historical and contemporary case studies, we will collectively explore questions such as: How do we know that an instrument, such as a thermometer, measures the quantity it is intended to measure? How are measurement units established, and how do they vary across different fields of science and culture? What does it mean to measure human attributes, such as feeling, if possible at all? Our journey begins with in-depth discussions on accuracy and precision, calibration, and standardization—the foundational concepts that make measurement possible. We then navigate the diverse landscape of philosophical viewpoints on measurement, encompassing operationalism, conventionalism, and realism. With these concepts and perspectives in mind, we will explore more case studies across various scientific domains, ranging from the physical and biological sciences to clinical medicine and social sciences, where you will discover issues more closely related to your own field of study. In the course, you will bring and elaborate your own case study related to your specific interests or fields of study. This case study serves as a focal point for actively applying concepts and approaches learned throughout the course, which will eventually crystallize into your final paper. From the course, you will come to see measurement not merely as a technical process but as a complex epistemic activity that demands critical examination, from experimental design to data interpretation. No prior background in specialized sciences is necessary to enroll in this course.
STV 20617	Scientific theories have enjoyed much success; they afford us tremendous power to predict and explain phenomena in the world around us. In light of this power, you might wonder why it is these theories are so successful. This question invariably leads to others. For instance: how much do our chosen theories tell us about the world---must the unseen entities referenced by scientific explanations exist? And just what counts as a &quot;scientific explanation&quot; anyhow? This course will equip you with the tools necessary to begin answering these and other questions. We will survey classic and contemporary debates in the philosophy of science, including: the reality of unobservable entities posited by theories; the nature of scientific explanation; how we choose between competing theories; and how we confirm existing theories. We will also consider applications to examples from the physical sciences. However, this course is self-contained: no previous familiarity with any particular physical or mathematical theory is required.
STV 20626	We live and act in an ecological theater created by God that includes all other living organisms and their ecosystems within the biosphere. Urgent questions abound today about what our relationship is to the rest of the natural world. What is our place in the world? This course investigates the Christian understanding of God as Creator, creation, and our human relationship to God, one another, and the natural world. We will examine the theology of creation beginning with Scripture and the Creed and progressing through the Early Church, Medieval, and modern time periods. We will also discuss theological anthropology in terms of our identity and mission within our ecological home. To this end, we will apply Pope Francis' notion of integral ecology to the specific case of the Great Lakes watershed in which we live, examining topics such as biodiversity, water, agriculture, and energy. As ecological citizens and creatures of God, we will also address the connection between liturgy and ecology. This course will have a special appeal to students interested in the intersection of theology and science, especially ecology and environmental studies. 
STV 20700	World population has doubled in the last 50 years, and sustainable development in the face of global change is the greatest challenge of our time. Through readings, lectures and class discussions by topic (water, energy, resources, waste, environment and related topics), this class provides an overview of the origin, scale and complexity of the challenge, and discusses how we can contribute, as engineers, scientists and professionals to help address it. We will learn the fundamental quantitative tools to measure and evaluate environmental and resources problems, which will be applied in class projects focusing on specific sustainability issues. The course will conclude by studying how environmental and resources policy decisions are made, and discuss the tradeoffs and ethical dilemmas involved.
STV 20888	This course investigates the Christian understanding of creation and how this doctrine relates to contemporary scientific issues. We will examine the development of the doctrine beginning with Scripture and the Creed and progressing through the early Church period into the Medieval and Scholastic era, focusing on the concepts of creation ex nihilo, creation continua, divine Providence, and divine action in the world. With the rise of the modern era, we will analyze the origin of and principles involved with the purported conflict between science and theology. We will bring the doctrine of creation into dialogue with three contemporary issues in the sciences: cosmology, evolution, and ecology. Integral to this course will be the relationship and response of humankind to God and to creation. This course will have a special appeal to students interested in the intersection of science and theology.
STV 20983	Food feeds culture. It nourishes societies as well as bodies. No discipline is intelligible without it. It provides economics with products, physiology with sustenance, social sciences with classes and relationships of power. and intellects with food for thought. Food's also essential in ecology. Our most intimate contact with the environment occurs when we eat it. From interdisciplinary perspectives, we'll approach the history of food in all cultures (including, by the way, those of non-human cultural creatures) in all periods that we can say something about, from the origins of carnivorism and cannibalism through famines and fushion to the food-related environmental problems of the future. There may even be time to explore cuisines.
STV 23200	Humans deeply affect their social and natural worlds. Their impact reverberates across time and space making it difficult to understand the long-term ramifications of our daily decisions and actions. This seminar enhances our understanding of the complex web of relationships between humans, resources, and climate by exploring the concepts of sustainability and collapse from an anthropological perspective. Key questions guiding this exploration include: What do we mean by sustainability? What is it that want to sustain? How can societies be &quot;sustained&quot; when we know societal collapses happen time and again? Through readings, media, debates, and analysis, we will learn how our culture shapes and promotes both sustainability and collapse and assess whether they can be attained or prevent. And, we will all gain a better understanding of our place in the world around us.
STV 25000	The current generation of colleges students will face a host of challenges in their lifetimes, including a global population that will potentially reach 9 billion by the early 2040s, depleting resources, and declining ecosystems. Additionally, the world is currently experiencing the worst global pandemic it has faced in over a century, whose effects will linger for years to come while foreshadowing the potential impact of other impending shocks. If current economic growth continues in a &quot;business as usual&quot; framework, future generations will face an increased dearth of decent jobs, growing social divisions, and devastating threats to the environment. This course will explore this confluence of issues and help students to consider a new roadmap for economic development and human flourishing that respects the dignity of every individual and the environment. Readings and lectures will look at the intersection of economic growth, industry, food security, water scarcity, health, religion, innovation science, and climate change. Case studies and real world examples will link theory to policy and practice. A major component of this course will be in-class discussions and case studies that will push students to think critically and debate the important questions within the study of sustainable development. The objective of these discussions will be to a) explore the interconnectedness of many of these issues and their varying degrees of impact on the wealthy, the middle class, and the poor or marginalized; b) understand different models of governance at international, national, and local levels that are trying to work through these issues; and c) bridge theory to policy and practice. This course requires active student participation in class as well as group projects and quizzes to gauge how well students are absorbing the material.
STV 30005	Many people predict that the 21st century will be the &quot;Asian Century,&quot; dominated by China, India, and other nation-states on the continent. What does it mean to imagine an Asian future? In this class, we answer this question by rethinking connections between past, present, and future, both within and between different nations in Asia. How can we better understand the global connections between past and present if we take Asia, rather than Europe and North America, as our starting point? By contextualizing contemporary issues in Asia within global social and historical context, students will learn to move beyond common stereotypes about the region. We will use materials from history, anthropology, religion, and literature to explore the impacts of colonialism, nationalism, and globalization on everyday life across the continent. Through this course, students will learn how to analyze the intersections of personal, local, regional, and global contexts in order to better explain how Asia shapes our world. All majors and backgrounds are welcome. No prior knowledge about Asian languages or topics is required. 
STV 30007	Politics, markets, and the environment are all spheres of development that are fundamentally shaped by the action and interaction of many individuals over time. For example, the Arab Spring protests, the shortage of medicines in Caracas, and the rising water temperatures of the Baltic Sea are all system-level outcomes arising from the individual actions of thousands or even billions of people. In these spheres, leadership is often weak or non-existent. Scientists call these &quot;complex systems.&quot; Complexity is difficult to study in the real world. Instead, scientists often approach these phenomenon using computer simulations (sometimes called agent-based models, social network models, and computational models). The goal is to build computer models of development that link the actions and interactions of individuals to the system-level outcomes. This class will use the perspective, literature, and tools of complexity science to approach core questions in the field of development. No programming experience is required, but students should be prepared to learn a new language called Netlogo. It is a free program which is described as having a &quot;low threshold&quot; (easy to get started) and &quot;high ceiling&quot; (many capabilities).
STV 30023	Although the mass media is not formally part of the U.S. government, it is arguably the most powerful institution shaping public attitudes, creating and producing information, and communicating political information to individual citizens. Almost all exposure to politics comes not from direct experience but from mediated stories. And, with the rise of the Internet, the growth of 24-hour cable news, and the decline of the &quot;Big Three&quot; television networks has created, a more diffuse media environment has been created. The primary purpose of this course is to analyze the role of the media in American politics and its relationship with the public, government, and candidates for office in a democratic society.
STV 30055	This course will provide advanced undergraduates and graduate students with a critical introduction to digital humanities for the study of early China, the fountainhead of Chinese Civilization. Collaborating with the Center of Digital Scholarship, this course will focus on relational data with structured information on historical figures, especially high officials, of early Chinese empires. Throughout the semester, we will read academic articles, mine data from primary sources, and employ Gephi and ArcGIS to visualize data. Those constructed data will cover three major themes: how geographical mobility contributed to consolidating a newly unified empire over diversified regions; how social networks served as the hidden social structure channeling the flow of power and talents; and how criminal records and excavated legal statutes shed light on the unique understanding of law and its relationship with the state in Chinese history.
STV 30108	This course offers a broad thematic overview of the history of capitalism from the early sixteenth century up to the late 1980s. As a discussion-based seminar, we will devote most of our conversations to discovering, analyzing and reflecting on the transformation of the U.S. from a newly-independent British colony, to the most influential economic power in the world. Topics and themes we will consider include: the rise of early modern transnational capitalism, European imperialism and trade, and indigenous dispossession after 1492; science and technological transformations; social and economic thought; slavery and servitude, broadly construed; and characteristics of prosperity, wealth, and economic flux. Our readings and viewings will be a mix of scholarly and primary sources, including an abundance of canonical literary and artistic material, such as novels, visual art, and film excerpts (e.g. Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House (1879), Aaron Douglas's Building More Stately Mansions (1944), and Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence (1920)). Over the course of the semester, students will draw upon this eclectic combination of sources to synthesize the dominant historical dimensions of capitalism in and beyond the U.S. via four short essays (4 - 5 pages, double-spaced-between 1,100 and 1,400 words), and a final paper (10 - 12 pages, double-spaced) based on cumulative texts.
STV 30114	With help from athletes such as Billie Jean King, Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James, Serena Williams, and Megan Rapinoe, Americans are growing accustomed to thinking about sports as embedded in the politics of gender, class, race, sexuality, and the nation. Consider the variety of places where sports happen, however, and the ways we develop and consume those places, and it becomes apparent that sports are also environmental in significant and complex ways. This course will examine the environmental politics of sports from conservation to climate change through the lenses of history and cultural studies. Course content will range from 19th century hunting, Indigenous surfing, and BASE jumping, to pick-up basketball, pro stadiums, and Notre Dame Athletics. Topical sections include outdoor sports and conservation, mountain sports and public land use, parks and recreation, stadiums and environmental justice, sports and climate change, and sustainability in the NCAA. Course requirements include regular reading and discussion, midterm and final essays, and a research project on a topic of the student's choice.
STV 30117	Inflammation is a fundamental biological phenomenon - whether it preserves or destroys is often a matter of context. In this course, we focus specifically on neuroinflammation - i.e., inflammation as it relates to the central (and peripheral) nervous system. We begin with the founding principles of molecular and cellular immunology in the context of the human nervous system. Next, we will explore the biological, environmental, and human components of (neuro)inflammatory disease through clinical case studies and representations in literature and media. Finally, we ask: how do medical, healthcare, and pharmaceutical constructs define the sociocultural experience of disease? Thus in this class, we integrate the scientific and the social: How do humans, how does humanity at large, deal with (neuro)inflammation? Can we firefight our collective future? This course is open to all majors. Strongly recommended prerequisites: Biology I: Big Questions (BIOS10171) OR Neuroscience and Behavior (BIOS20450) OR Cell Biology (BIOS30341) OR Cellular Biology: Stem Cells to Disease (BIOS30410)
STV 30118	Germany is globally recognized as a leader in the fields of renewable energy, sustainable development, and environmental protection. But how did this come about? In this course, we will examine the roles that culture and history play in shaping human attitudes towards the environment. Our case studies will range over two centuries, from damming projects in the Rhine valley at the start of the nineteenth century to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster at the end of the twentieth. We will study novels, films, and philosophical essays alongside works by leading environmental historians. Over the course of the semester, students will develop a richer understanding of German environmentalism that also includes an awareness of its dark sides, such as the role that nature conservancy played within Nazi ideology.
STV 30123	If you were to perform a Google image search of “human evolution,” you would see endless pictures of men linearly evolving from apes to modern humans. These overwhelmingly one-sided depictions are because much of our human evolutionary story has been written by and about men to the exclusion of women. Consequently, many of the key theories explaining the unique suite of human features seem to assume that evolutionary forces act only upon men, and women are merely passive beneficiaries. Not only is this exclusion of roughly half the population sexist, it is also bad science – bad science that to this day has been repeated and perpetuated to justify the status quo. In this class, we will explore human evolution from a feminist perspective intellectually drawing upon human biology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, primatology, exercise physiology, and reproductive health to demonstrate that women were and still are a driving force in human evolution. Using non-traditional learning methods and assignments, we will cover: 1) foundational feminist human evolutionary theory, 2) the pervasiveness of estrogen, 3) physical/athletic performance and sexual division of labor; 4) the significance and frequency of alloparenting; 5) multiple orgasms and the control of women’s sexuality; 6) cooperation and competition among women; 7) concealment (or not) of human ovulation; 8) evolutionary reasons for the difficulty of human birth; 9) the physical and mental resilience of women; and 10) the crucial role grandmothers and menopause. It is my hope that this class not only provides an alternative perspective to current thinking in human evolution, but also encourages students to bring their experiences and perspectives to bear. Because who asks the questions matters, and a greater diversity of views can only improve and enrich our holistic understanding of human evolution.
STV 30132	This course is an introduction to the new field of environmental history. While many people think &quot;The Environment&quot; suddenly became important with the first &quot;Earth Day&quot; in 1970 (or a few years earlier), environmental issues have in fact long been of central importance. In recent decades historians have begun actively to explore the past sensibilities of various groups toward their surroundings and fellow creatures. They have also increasingly paid attention to the ways environmental factors have affected history. This course will range widely, from world history to the story of a single river, from arguments about climate change to the significance of pink flamingos, and will survey a number of types of history including cultural, demographic, religious, and animal.
STV 30147	A generation ago, students looking to pursue careers in media were likely journalism or broadcasting majors who could aspire to master one platform and work for the same news company for decades. No more. People don't consume news in the ways they once did; the media landscape is changing. There are new challenges -- how to regulate misinformation, how to fund big investigative projects -- but also new opportunities. Digital tools are eliminating ‘start-up' barriers and giving storytellers more control over their fates. Aspiring news writers or producers no longer need to work their way up in a legacy company, hoping to someday catch their big break. You could manage a YouTube channel with thousands of subscribers from your dorm room. Some of you probably already do. But how do you monetize such ventures? How do you turn a side project or a cool idea into a career? In &quot;Media Entrepreneurship,&quot; we'll explore how you can combine your passion and skills - skills cultivated as a student of the liberal arts -- to capitalize on media's exciting new frontier. You'll gain the knowledge, tools, and confidence to see &quot;being your own boss&quot; or &quot;launching your own brand&quot; as a realistic career possibility. And it's not just about you. When you hear the word &quot;entrepreneur,&quot; you might think of a guy pitching an idea to venture capitalists on Shark Tank. But, at its best, media entrepreneurship is an act of service. It's about building trust, meeting community needs, and expanding whose voices we hear as a society. In this course, you'll practice conceiving of a media project and creating your own startup business plan. I look forward to working alongside you. 
STV 30150	This course aims to change the way you think not only about the way that we play games, but also about the way that video games teach their players to behave within their digital worlds. This course will encourage students to reflect on and utilize their lived experiences as players, and utilize these experiences to locate themselves within their analysis and writing as well as their design practices. This course will undertake an intensive, interdisciplinary focus on the history of video game development, representation in video games, and the languages that digital games work in as well as decolonial theory and diverse theories of design. This class will engage with a variety of scholarly texts, video games, media posts, videos, and design exercises, in order to illustrate the ways in which video games have shaped the ways we play, think, and behave within their spaces. Students will be required to write and design around these lessons and address and push back against the problematic behaviors and colonial narratives around violence, race, gender, sexuality, and relationship to the land that these gamic languages and lessons have created.
STV 30154	The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 26% of Americans (about 61 million people) have a disability—a physical, intellectual, sensory, or self-care impediment that affects major life activities. This course considers this population, their stories and experiences, as well as how disability—as a social, cultural, legal, and political construct—has shaped the nation and its history. A particular focus of the course will be on disability and social justice. Throughout American history, and still today, disabled people have been excluded from basic civil rights, such as voting, marrying, holding property, and living independently. This course will examine how these restrictions developed and changed over time as well as how disabled people have fought for greater access and equality. Coursework may include response papers, primary source analysis, and a final project.
STV 30202	Conserving the earth's rich biological heritage while enhancing the well-being of some of the world's poorest people stands as a critical global challenge. This course examines this complex issue using the lens of political science and related fields such as political ecology, gender studies, and sustainability science. It will demonstrate how insights and approaches from these areas of scholarship can help understand and address the twin problems of biodiversity loss and poverty in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Examples will focus on forest and wildlife conservation and management. This course will be of interest to students from a wide range of natural and social science disciplines.
STV 30408	Fracking, Water Wars, Deforestation of the Amazon, Droughts, Global Warming, Climate Change, Unsustainable Agriculture, Hurricanes, Pollution, Species Extinction, Invasive Species, Poaching, Overfishing, Depletion of Fossil Fuels, Overpopulation, Wastes, Ocean Acidification, Wildfires, Oil Spills, Overpopulation, Overconsumption, Land degradation - the list goes on! These complex environmental problems are occurring constantly and rapidly; their consequences are global in scope and transcend national boundaries; and they embody the complex relationship between humans and the natural environment. This course is about developing an interdisciplinary understanding of the relationship between humans (society) and the environment. We will examine the historical and contemporary environmental challenges of global concern, the underlying role of humans, and attempts by society to address, mitigate, and adapt to such complex problems through policies, institutions, and governance. We will pay attention to the roles of different state and non-state actors in environmental policy making. Overall, students will draw from both the social and natural sciences to develop a deeper understanding of how society - through consumption, culture, politics, power, ethics, values, economic growth, location, etc... contribute to, or solve, environmental problems.
STV 30411	The application of artificial intelligence is expanding rapidly and has the potential to reshape many fields, including transportation, finance, health care, marketing, social media, criminal justice, and public policy, just to name a few. AI's ability to predict human preference and behavior or even substitute human judgement in these fields creates opportunities as well as concerns for safety, bias and discrimination, transparency, inequality, and job loss. Designed to serve students from no background in AI to those who have existing technical background, this course surveys current and emerging applications of AI in different fields and the related ethical issues and governance problems. The course targets students from different disciplines. Students from the humanities and social sciences will gain a deeper understanding of the technical aspects underpinning today's ethical and policy debates related to AI. Students with more technical background will better appreciate the ethical issues that arise in programming and engineering and understand how technology interacts with the broader societal contexts. The course's goal is to encourage students to become proactive in thinking of the societal implications of technological change and to incorporate such understanding in their education and careers.
STV 30456	Between the early rumblings of the Reformations and the last cannon shot of World War I, Europeans profoundly changed how they conceptualized bodies as experience and metaphors. During these four centuries, Europeans grounded the ways in which they interacted with each other and the world in bodily imaginings. On an individual level, the living, human body provided a means of accessing and understanding the material or spiritual world. On a collective scale, the physical body, its adornments, and its gestures provided markers that Europeans used to fracture society along axes of gender, sexuality, class, race, mental aptitude, and even sacrality. Drawing in part from their myriad imaginings of the human body, Europeans constructed metaphorical political bodies. The body politic assumed diverse forms spanning from divine right monarchs to revolutionary republics to modern nation states. Our course will lay bare the human body as culturally constructed, while fleshing out how Europeans' evolving visions affected political imaginings.
STV 30461	 Television has been widely available in the United States for only half a century, yet aleady it has become a key means through which we understand our culture. Our course examines this vital medium from three perspectives. First, we will look at the industrial, economic and technological forces that have shaped U.S. television since its inception. These factors help explain how U.S. television adopted the format of advertiser-supported broadcast networks and why this format is changing today. Second, we will explore television's role in American social and political life: how TV has represented cultural changes in the areas of gender, class, race and ethnicity. Third, we will discuss specific narrative and visual strategies that characterize program formats. Throughout the semester we will demonstrate how television and U.S. culture mutually influence one another, as television both constructs our view of the world and is affected by social and cultural forces within the U.S.  
STV 30493	This course explores the myriad of national security policy challenges facing the United States and the policy options to address these challenges. The course will explore security issues with Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as well as climate change, global health/pandemics, cyber threats/security and terrorism/extremism. The course will include lectures by policy experts and student engagement with these experts to explore policy options and their potential for success. Students will conduct research of primary source policy documents to develop a policy memorandum for the US National Security Council that will outline a policy challenge for the United States and recommend policy options for consideration.
STV 30550	Over the last two decades, there has been a groundswell of interest in global health across multiple disciplines and professional fields. The field of global health recognizes the multidimensionality of health as well as the interconnectedness of everyone living in the world today; its primary goal is to eliminate health disparities to achieve health equity for all. This course will provide foundational knowledge necessary to understand what global health is today; its history and evolution; how social theory contributes to understanding specific global health problems; the importance of understanding health and designing interventions by using a biosocial model that includes a myriad of cultural, social, political, economic factors; and an understanding of the role of various actors on the global health stage including international, bilateral, and civil society organizations. 
STV 30553	Social Entrepreneurship has sparked dialogue and debate for two decades. Its very definition is much debated, as well as its capacity to create sustainable, scalable, systems-changing impact. This course explores the theoretical concepts, practices and strategies associated with the dynamic discipline of social enterprise and innovation. For our purposes, social entrepreneurship is the landscape, of which paradigm-shifting solutions like microfinance, MSME (Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise) development, bottom of the pyramid, fair trade, impact investing, and the like, are components. This course will study many of these concepts, focusing on their opportunity for social impact, and as a vehicle for wealth creation in vulnerable and disenfranchised communities across the globe. Further, the course covers examples of various social enterprise models (for-profit, non-profit, hybrid), requiring students to analyze and devise strategies to improve the efficacy of these ventures. Finally, the course engages students in research seeking to advance the field of social entrepreneurship at the Keough School of Global Affairs and Notre Dame.
STV 30559	This course introduces the role of economics in environmental issues and in the formation of environmental policy. Topics covered include choice, externalities, market failure, cost-benefit and environmental valuation analyses, and climate change. The course aims to encourage students to think about pressing environmental issues in economic terms and equip students with the diverse set of economics tools to contribute to the evaluation and implementation of wise policy choices. There is no prior knowledge of economics required, and students will have the opportunity to learn basic economic principles and frameworks that guide decision-making regarding environmental issues. 
STV 30635	Alcohol Use Disorder is a chronic relapsing brain disease. But when presented on screen, it's entertainment. Why do we laugh, why do we cry, why do we emulate fictional characters whose drinking habits result in a life of debilitating addiction? From Humphrey Bogart to Ron Burgundy the psychology and seduction of alcohol on film, in television, and laptops will be analyzed. Furthermore, what is the relationship between the manner in which alcohol use/abuse is presented on screen and the manner in which alcohol is used and abused on, for example, college campuses? Surveying film and television history, we will examine how alcohol is used in story structure, as a character flaw or strength, and as a narrative device in the story arc of films across multiple film genres, (action/adventure, comedy, romance, etc). Why do characters drink, where do they drink, and how does the result of their &quot;getting drunk&quot; advance the narrative? We'll also look at non-fiction films that tackle issues of addiction, as a way of comparing character development in Hollywood films to the results of this same behavior in everyday life. Film materials will include weekly screenings outside of class, and academic articles relating to portrayal and analysis of alcohol use in film and television, including the business of marketing campaigns, product placement, and box office results. From the psychological perspective we will discuss the topic and process of social influence and how the presence of others influences our behavior. Questions of interest will include the following: what are the mechanisms by which group influence unfolds? How and why might we be persuaded? Does the manner, and if so how, in which alcohol use is portrayed in movies and the media reflect the processes and principles of social influence? Readings will include chapters on social influence, persuasion and academic articles evaluating the manner in which alcohol is portrayed and advertised and the effect this has on alcohol consumption. In addition, issues of addiction will be discussed - from understanding the basis of addiction to examining the efficacy of addiction treatment.
STV 30750	Generative AI is a form of computing in which computer systems generate media such as text, images, sound, video, or combinations based on prompts or other information provided to the computer. These systems, including, but are not limited to, ChatGPT, Midjourney &amp; DALLE, have been evolving rapidly and have led to extreme excitement, confusion, and fear. This course provides a survey of how to understand and use a number of these tools including explorations in prompt engineering as well as addressing issues from across the liberal arts including artistic, economic, social/psychological, educational and legal concerns and opportunities.
STV 30800	As an Integration course, students successfully completing the class will have fulfilled a University core curriculum requirement. Reflecting an integration of key considerations from the disciplines of Economics and Business Ethics, the course will allow students the opportunity to examine the complexities of climate change, public policy, environmental and social sustainability, and impacts on global economies and communities. Economics will provide the foundation of knowledge of labor market structure, market failures such as externalities, taxation, migration decisions, discrimination, and income inequality measures. The management approach will address business in practice, and organizational and societal dimensions of effective and ethical business. Topics will include climate change; resilience and its measures; climate change-driven migration around the world and its impacts on labor markets and the business environment; ethical frameworks for guiding business; stakeholder analysis; environmental justice and the disproportionate effects on communities by socio-economic status, race and gender; and regulation and international agreements. Students will participate in experiential activities in real-world contexts, examine indicators of societal resilience, present relevant data in a compelling way through individual and team projects, reflect understanding through assessments including quizzes and exams, and present a policy proposal, all reflective of an integrative approach.
STV 30858	In this course, we will study the novel challenges of the digital economy. The course will begin with economic concepts and issues related to the network industry structure, in particular market power analysis and the appropriate regulatory and antitrust responses. Policy issues related to net neutrality, network access and the &quot;digital divide&quot; will form the next segment of the course. The exchange of personal information for access to &quot;free&quot; networks will then be examined from both an economic and policy perspective. We will conclude by comparing and constrasting various international approaches to the digital economy.
STV 30877	This course will survey historical scholarship on the development of American cities and suburbs from World War II to the present. Making use of primary and secondary sources, and print and visual media, we will seek to understand what defines American cities and suburbs, how the idea and ideals of cities and suburbs have changed over time, and what forces have shaped the places in which we live today. We will explore how a metropolitan approach to modern American history sheds light on major events, movements, and transformations of the twentieth century along thematic lines of race, class, and education; politics and protest; modernity and religion; gender and sexuality; ethnicity, immigration, globalization, and citizenship; urban crisis, renewal, and gentrification; and urban sprawl and environmentalism. Course objectives include learning to analyze and interpret primary sources, including written texts, film, photographs, and the built environment; to read secondary sources critically and effectively; to identify significant people, places, and events in twentieth-century American urban, social, and political history; to recognize major changes and continuities in postwar urban history; and to place contemporary issues and debates in historical and cultural context.
STV 30890	How do the contemporary film and television industries work? How can an analysis of the &quot;business of entertainment&quot; enable a greater understanding of contemporary media aesthetics and culture? This course will explore these questions by focusing on the structure, practices and products of America's film and television industries, and students will engage with academic readings, screenings, trade publications, current events, guest lectures, and written and oral assignments in order to understand the activities of the film and television industries. By the end of the course, students should be able to understand prominent practices employed by media conglomerates and independent companies today, recognize the ways in which industrial structures and practices can shape media products, and examine how television shows and movies are influenced by business strategies. The course should be especially beneficial for students intending to pursue scholarly or professional careers related to film and television through its comprehensive overview of how these industries work, why they work as they do, and the broader practical and theoretical implications of media industry operations
STV 30900	Sociological theory is the foundation of sociology. Students in this course will learn two things: first, what theorists do and why and, second, how to use fundamental theoretic concepts - such as exploitation and alienation, social structure and solidarity, bureaucracy and charisma - to analyze and explain contemporary society.
STV 30902	Sociology 30902 is designed to provide an overview of research methods in the social sciences. Topics covered include (1) hypothesis formulation and theory construction; (2) the measurement of sociological variables; and (3) data collection techniques - experimental, survey, and observational. At the end of the course, students should appreciate both the strengths and the limitations of sociological research methods.
STV 30986	This class examines the history of engineering in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and its relationship with capitalism and development on a global scale, with the use of digital tools. Engineers came to design, implement, and manage nearly all elements of the modern world from their positions within corporations and state bureaucracies; they quickly became the primary agents in development in the 20th century. We will examine the history of engineering, introduce students to basic tools in data science, digital humanities, and data visualization, and students will develop data-intensive research projects using the skills they have learned. The class is designed for students from both Arts &amp; Letters and STEM disciplines as a window onto historical methods and an introduction to using qualitative data for analysis and data visualization. There are no prerequisites. This course emerges from a three-year NSF-funded research grant to the instructors, which includes a commitment to develop new undergraduate courses on the subject and the development of open access course materials. Student projects from this course are eligible for inclusion in our global dataset and for hosting on the project website.
STV 33022	In ancient and medieval texts the soul is the principle of life, of sense-perception, emotions, passions, rational thought and ethical behavior. Throughout history, the investigation of the soul has been special in two ways. First of all, we are not addressing an external topic; we are treating ourselves. Secondly, this study of ourselves is not merely meant to describe and analyze, but to change and to form. Ancient philosophers thought of their work as &quot;care of the soul&quot;. The soul is not a mechanism or machine, but something living which can err and go wrong. Pre-modern authorities often described this in the terms of sickness: The body may be sick and need the help of the doctor, and the soul may need therapy if it is sick. In the course, we will address a selection of texts and topics from ancient and medieval sources (Plato, Aristotle, Galen, the Stoics, Neoplatonic authors and Christian authors from Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages), and compare them with select contemporary texts. What constitutes a healthy soul? What are the sicknesses of the soul? What therapies are recommended? How can one build resilience and how much resilience is right? What role does gender play? The course will also integrate lectures/discussions with practicing therapists and a field trip to &quot;mindworks&quot; (Chicago Museum of Cognitive Psychology).
STV 33101	By helping us step back to see humans as primates, mammals, vertebrates, and beyond, evolutionary theory provides a framework for understanding many aspects of our day-to-day lives that shape the health and well-being, including weight gain-diet, psychosocial stress, immune function, sleep patterns, risky behavior, and child development. But, increasing evidence from the exciting field of &quot;developmental origins of health and disease&quot; suggests that our biological and behavioral patterns are far from being determined solely by our genes. Our early life contexts, from before birth, and possibly even the experiences of our parents and grandparents in prior generations influence how our brains and biological systems function, including how genes are expressed, and thus impact our health and behavior. This course will bring these dynamic perspectives together to answer questions regarding why we get sick, how our bodies flexibly respond to the world around us, and the inheritances we receive from our ancestors.
STV 33104	In 1987, the Soviet Union was the largest political entity on the planet. Four years later, it had vanished from the map entirely. In this interdisciplinary course, you will learn about the ‘new Russia’ that has emerged in the three decades since this stunning collapse. Drawing on an array of resources in English translation, you will explore the politics, media, and culture of the post-Soviet period: from the lawless years of the “wild 90s” under Boris Yeltsin to the return of totalitarianism under Vladimir Putin and his brutal invasion of Ukraine. In so doing, your study of contemporary Russia will lead us to discuss some of the most pressing questions in global politics today. What is the nature of truth and power in Putin’s dystopian propaganda state? Should the current leadership in Russia be described as a fascist regime or neo-Soviet? And, perhaps most importantly, how did Russia’s democratic experiment ultimately end with the launch of the largest war in Europe since 1945—and what lessons might this failure hold for America and the rest of the world?
STV 33333	As an emergent field of ethnographic theory and methods, design anthropology involves talking to people, figuring out what they want, and creating ways to improve our shared lives. These practices are focused on developing ideas and forms based on people’s needs while anticipating conscious practice and considerate use. Design anthropologists create potentials for future selves, anticipating projected needs and transcending potential limitations. This seminar introduces the emerging phenomenon and ongoing merger of the anthropology of design. It integrates sources in design anthropology, ethnographic design, cultural marketing, and other applied methodologies. We will engage with theoretical discussions, analytical approaches, practicing exercises, and portfolio development to explore the holistic depths of this nascent field.
STV 33996	Traditional strategies to fight against poverty, inequality and climate change have proved ineffective in the last decades. New and creative solutions are required where cutting-edge technological innovation and multidisciplinary work serve the common good. In this course, you will explore the state of the art in AI business development and its ethical implications in relation to current global societal and environmental challenges. You will reflect on your individual role in society and develop critical thinking about the current socio-technical value system. Our readings will include original works of philosophers, economists and computer scientists as well as examples of state-of-the-art AI supported business and institutional projects. As a result of the readings and class discussions, you will acquire well-informed understanding about the implications of the AI Trustworthy principle of justice and fairness, including non-discrimination and avoidance of unfair bias. You will become aware of the potential for AI to contribute, if well managed, towards fairer and more sustainable societies as well as the dangers it entails to widen inequalities and aggravate the discrimination suffered by vulnerable communities. This is a hands-on course where you will be ideating and planning projects for the social good. I will accompany you in the development of business plans where ethics is the driver and AI is the key instrument. I will help you define your project idea in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Therefore, your projects will be designed to work towards mitigating poverty, reducing gender and race inequality, combating climate change, improving the sustainability of cities and communities, ensuring affordable and clean energy, achieving responsible consumption and production, improving the quality of education, providing better health and well-being services, ensuring decent work and economic growth or promoting peaceful and inclusive societies. The goal of the course is to encourage and support you, as new entrepreneurs and future leaders, to work in multidisciplinary teams and develop interdisciplinary skills, being able to take advantage of new technology to create and manage projects for ethics in action.
STV 33997	This course explores ethical issues posed by the internet and online communication systems. The primary aim of the course is to identify ethical issues related to the internet and reason through different engineering, design, and policy solutions. Students will be introduced to standard normative ethical theories to provide them with a solid theoretical grounding that they can use to better understand and make sense of the applied ethical topics that will be the focus of the course. Topics covered include (but are not limited to) internet censorship, surveillance capitalism, echo chambers, fake news, online shaming, online anonymity, the digital divide, the right to be forgotten, the ethics of hacking, the metaverse, and intellectual property rights in the digital age. By the end of the course, students should be able to analyze and evaluate philosophical arguments well as write formal philosophical essays.
STV 33999	What happens when computing moves into new spaces of engineering and science? In this course, students will engage with ethical questions at the intersection of computing and biotechnology as a launching pad to consider additional ethical dilemmas in other areas of engineering and propose solutions to them. This course will be grounded in an overview of the philosophy of technology and tech ethics. The focus will then shift to contemporary ethical challenges within biotech work, including big data, computational biology, and artificial intelligence. Finally, we will look toward the future and examine how technology may support a future worth wanting. The course will ask big questions such as: how does technology shape the way we see ourselves and others? Students will be equipped to reflect seriously on these topics by reading contemporary think pieces, academic journal articles, short fiction, and political theory. This course will prepare students to engage with the practical and intellectual challenges of an ethically engaged tech career. This signature course is part of the Ethics at Work Project,
STV 40105	The new wave of technologies, e.g., robotics and AI will have long-lasting impacts on the labor market. Jobs will be displaced, new tasks will be created, different skills will be demanded, and new management practices will emerge. These new technologies may benefit workers unevenly, potentially increasing inequality. At the same time, new demographic challenges driven by aging will have large impacts on labor. How will these forces affect the future of labor and how should we prepare for changes in the labor market? The goal of this course is to provide students with a framework for analyzing how new technologies like robotics and AI will affect the labor market drawing largely from the economics literature. Students will analyze and describe the literature on these topics and understand the different methodologies used in the literature. Ultimately, students will build perspectives on how AI and robotics could affect jobs, occupations, the future of work, income distribution and social institutions. Students will also build perspectives on education, training, and redistribution policies that can help mitigate the labor market disruptions created by technological change. Students will collect and analyze data that can provide insights on the future of labor.
STV 40121	MATERIALS FEE. The course develops an understanding of what data means to humans and how does its visualization helps communicate ideas in the fields of medicine, technology and social sciences. The course touches upon measurement, collection and reporting, analysis but ultimately focuses on visualization. Visualization is when the data comes alive and is ready to be used to communicate a complex concept be it numeric, spatial, process or temporal. Types of data covered in this course include but are not limited to: geographical, cultural, scientific, financial, statistical, meteorological, natural, and transportation data. The goal of the exercises within this course is to understand how data can be used to tell a story as opposed to merely packaging and plotting a set of numbers on a page. The design process is therefore exploring the static, dynamic, interactive or 3-dimensional and performance formats of representation and understand why a certain format is more or less suitable for the nature of data, its analysis and therefore its representation. Students develop an understanding of how the graphics being used must correlate completely with the data and numbers that are being represented. The course traverses through these considerations to understand the various approaches that can be used to bring data to life and allow the viewer to understand a story that is being packaged within the representation. Is there revelation or a deeper understanding of a pattern once your data has been visualized and presented that had not been discovered earlier?
STV 40151	This course has two basic objectives. First, it examines from a lifespan and psychobiological perspective the factors that place individuals at different stages of life at risk for illness and assist them in maintaining their health. In addition, it addresses a variety of challenging psychological and social issues that physicians and other healthcare professionals must face in the practice of medicine. The course covers a range of topics dealing with health issues related to different stages of human development (childhood, adolescence, and adulthood), disabled populations, culture and gender, stress, physician-patient interactions, death and dying, professional ethics, and social policies relating to health care. The course is primarily intended for students intending to enter medical school. Most classes will involve brief formal presentations by the instructors and invited guests, followed by discussion of assigned readings pertinent to the day's topic. In addition, students will be exposed, through a limited practicum, to a variety of medical settings.
STV 40196	This course offers a multidisciplinary introduction to the vast variety of theoretical approaches used to understand media and technologies. From film, TV, and videogames to computers, internet, and social media, we will study different methods and concepts that help us understand our mediated condition(s) better. Moving historically and geographically, we will also encounter the many ways in which the term 'media' itself gets deployed and critiqued in scholarship across humanistic and social scientific disciplines. We will plug some of these (critical) theoretical understandings of media and culture into the longer histories of politics, philosophy, language, and literature, considering, for example, books as media technologies. And finally, we will ask what studies of media and mediation can do for our comprehension of the politico-economic, sociocultural, racial, and environmental crises surrounding us today.
STV 40206	Global health is an area of study, research and practice that focuses on achieving equity in health for all people worldwide. The health status of individuals and populations arise from a myriad of complex biological, social, economic, political, and environmental factors that operate synergistically. Through a social justice lens, we will examine how these factors shape health outcomes and how interventions must be developed that include addressing the root causes of inequity. We will use a case-based approach, focusing on specific health problems in several countries, including the United States. Cases will include a variety of themes including health disparities arising from stress-associated racial discrimination, the epidemiological transition from infectious to non-communicable diseases, and how the health effects of climate change disproportionately affect the most vulnerable.
STV 40222	“Life Cycle Assessment” is a lecture- and practicum-based class primarily targeted at graduate students. The class is designed as a once-per-week session where we will spend about half the time on lectures and the other half on hands-on activities to practice LCA. The class is designed to introduce you to Life Cycle Assessment as a method for evaluating environmental, and social impacts of products, policies, systems, and services, with a focus on International Standards Organization (ISO)-compliant LCA. We will primarily be using OpenLCA, with some exposure to alternative tools. This course will particularly focus on LCA practice in the context of policy development, with emphasis on LCA’s role as a decision support tool. We will address the implications of LCA and related methods being increasingly required in policy contexts (e.g., for prioritizing grant recipients and allocating tax subsidies). We will also address the challenges associated with disparities in the maturity of various life cycle methods, most notably social LCA in comparison to environmental LCA and life cycle costing. We will evaluate published LCAs in forms like Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements, and also investigate the use of life cycle thinking and LCA for Environmental Product Declarations. The course will also emphasize the role of LCA in the energy transition, particularly given LCA’s strong role in greenhouse gas accounting, and explore how both technological and climate dynamics pose challenges for LCA practice. This course is primarily a methods course, and we will work through case studies and examples together both in and out of class, with a topical emphasis on energy, buildings, and climate due to LCA’s particular relevance in those areas.
STV 40300	The concept of the &quot;commons&quot; has returned to the focus of socio-environmental research, politics, and theorizing with recent debates on climate crisis and justice. From the late 1960s debates on environmental degradation and overpopulation to the present concerns with social change, economic degrowth, and global warming, the &quot;commons&quot; has returned as a key symbol for social analysis, political organizing, and collective resource management. Since then, various currents have claimed and reclaimed the concept under the guide of &quot;communality,&quot; &quot;conviviality,&quot; &quot;common-pool resources,&quot; and the &quot;common&quot; as concrete alternatives to public and private modes of governance. In the past two decades, the concept has been central as well for the discussion of the &quot;digital commons&quot; with decentralized, community-based governance of online resources. In this seminar, we will map out key definitions of the &quot;commons&quot; to examine socio-technical and socio-environmental alternatives to existing enclosures across a wide range of examples (including, but not limited to land, tools, forests, lakes, heirloom seeds, potable water, fish stocks, software, hardware, and much more). The seminar will be organized around presentations by students and guest speakers, followed by debate of concepts, case studies, and methodological approaches in socio-environmental and digital commons research. We welcome advanced undergraduates and graduate students working on environmental research technologies, climate change, conservation, and sustainability to join the seminar.
STV 40301	This course explores how social media and other new technologies are profoundly reshaping the world, impacting democratic institutions, social cohesion, conflict, and the peacebuilding field. We will engage in deep-rooted analysis of technology's positive and negative impacts on society, drawing on neuroscience, psychology, political analysis, and economic research of the profit models, affordances, and designs of current technology platforms. Students will analyze the impact of digital technology on fifteen global conflicts and explore twenty spheres of digital peacebuilding. The course includes a policy analysis of proposed government regulations on technology companies. Participants will learn through case studies and policy dialogues to identify best practices for using social media to support peacebuilding.
STV 40409	A major source of conflict - increasingly so - is environmental issues; both climate change-related conflicts about (more and more scarce) resources as well as secondary conflicts (conflicts that arise because of the resource conflict, i.e. climate migrants) pose a major challenge to the planet. Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato Si has offered ways to think about an &quot;integral ecology&quot; that takes the environment, life on the planet, the human condition and culture seriously. The cry of the earth and the cry of the poor cannot be separated. Laudato Si has to be read against the background of the concept of &quot;Integral Human Development.&quot; This concept, inspired by the works of Joseph Lebret, OP, was introduced by Pope Paul VI in his encyclical Populorum Progressio (1967). It refers to &quot;the development of the whole person and the development of all persons.&quot; The course explores the connection (intersectionality) between peace, (integral) ecology, and (integral human) development. It will do so with in-class room teaching sessions and working with select case studies on integral ecology.
STV 40431	This course offers an introduction to some of the recent thinking and cultural phenomena on the Anthropocene. Although we will pay particular attention to the Iberian Peninsula and contemporary Spain in particular, we will ultimately attempt to come to terms with our current geological and civilizational epoch as mainly humanly driven. For that purpose, under examination and question will be primitive accumulation and Capitalism, humanism and posthumanism, rural depopulation, consumerism, energy use, industrial relocation, technology (social networks, smartphones, big data, Google, etc.); droughts, wildfires, human and planetary finitude, etc. This discourse will combine literary and cinematographic studies with conceptual perspectives that will ultimately seek to bear witness through thinking and the arts to the Anthropocene, if such thing is still possible. Taught in Spanish.
STV 40440	This course will explore the phenomenon of AIDS, including characteristics of the worldwide AIDS pandemic, the virus (HIV) itself, the immune system and HIV, methods of diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and basic epidemiology as it relates to AIDS. This is an advanced course in infectious diseases designed for premedical majors and other interested students. Laboratory experience in genetics and cell biology is required Fall. 
STV 40511	Data-informed decision making has created new opportunities, but also expands the set of possible risks to organizations. One of these risks comes from grappling with the &quot;should we?&quot; question with regard to data and analytics, and associated concerns with identity, privacy, ownership, and reputation. In this course, we will explore several frameworks to address the issues related to the proper roles of public law, government regulation, professional codes, organizational approaches, and individual ethics in performing and managing analytics activities. The course will cover applicable theory and guidelines, and also make use of case studies. Upon completion, the student should be comfortable adapting one of these ethical frameworks for use in alignment with their organizational mission.
STV 40534	Human induced climate change is one of the major problems facing society. Economics provides a powerful intellectual basis for understanding, analyzing and correcting these problems. This course will cover basic science of climate change, the associated market failure and tragedy of the commons, cost-benefit analysis of climate mitigation, computation of the social cost of carbon, empirical research on economic effects of climate change, adaptation, and carbon taxation.
STV 40590	Is it possible to think of the 21st century as a post-racial, post-feminist world? In her provocative 2012 study, Body as Evidence: Mediating Race, Globalizing Gender, Janell Hobson suggests that rather than having been eradicated, millennial hopes that the historical difficulties represented by race and gender have lost their significance in the present day are as far, if not even further away from the mark as they have ever been. For Hobson, policing the body, whether that be in terms of its race, its gender, or its sexuality, has remained paramount. &quot;[W]hile the early-twenty-first century discourse of 'postracial' and 'postfeminist' often declares the loss of meaning attached to race and gender,&quot; she argues, &quot;..the global scope of our media-reliant information culture insists on perpetuating raced and gendered meanings that support ideologies of dominance, privilege, and power.&quot; In Hobson's view, the body and how it is imagined rests at the center of such ideologies, pointing also to a number of crucial questions that become particularly important when considering the significance of race and gender through the lens of modernity. How might a reconsideration of race point also to a rethinking of gender and vice-versa? What does race actually mean? How does/can it alter the way we understand gender? Is it possible to think race beyond the idea of race? What might a new conception of race actually look like, and how might this influence our thinking on gender? How are the problems of race and gender intertwined, and how is/has the body been imagined in and through them? What can such questions tell us about today's racial and gendered realities, both inside and outside the university, both in the past and the present? This course takes a step backward to investigate these and other like questions in the context of the utopic impulse and its emphasis on the imagination in several 19th-century American authors whose work may be viewed as participating in a broad yet under-acknowledged vision of race, gender and Atlantic modernity that seeks to interrogate hierarchies of race and gender as these have been constructed and maintained within dominant ideologies. Grounding our analysis in a number of 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century political philosophical texts on law and utopia and drawing on insights from critical race theory, gender studies, feminist theory, theories of law and literature, and utopian studies, our goal will be to gain a more nuanced understanding of our racialized past and its troubled link to questions of gender both then and now, so that we may better hope to imagine - and reimagine - the shape of our collective democratic future in the 21st century's global community.
STV 40610	In this course students will explore the economic determinants of the city and the system of cities across space. The key objective of the course is to provide students with a toolbox to think about how space/geography matters for economic activity. For example, why are rents higher in the city center than in the suburbs? Why are average incomes in South Bend lower than in New York? To answer these questions the course combines basic theoretical frameworks with empirical evidence from research in urban economics and economic geography.
STV 40707	This course provides an intensive introduction to statistical methods of use for anthropological research. It will examine why and when to use quantitative methods, and how such methods can be incorporated into a holistic anthropological research design. Topics covered include probability theory, and parametric, non-parametric, and Bayesian principles of hypothesis testing, data ordination, and methods of analyzing non-independent data including network analysis. All course work will be undertaken using free statistical packages available through the R programing language. No prior mathematical or programming experience is needed.
STV 40825	This course examines the intersection of gender, health policy, and health care organization around the world. Gender is frequently a central contributing (though sometimes ignored) factor to people's health. Men and women have different biologies, and it thus stands to reason that their lives; social, economic, political, and biological would have an effect on their health. What causes men to have different illnesses than women? What places one gender at greater risk for illness than the other? How do men and women across the world experience health policies? Are they affected and constrained by similar factors? How do their work lives affect their experiences with health? How is the body medically produced? How do poverty and development play a role in people's well-being? Through an inquiry-based approach, these and other topics will be addressed in this class.
STV 40834	This class explores the use of marketing principles and concepts to support initiatives, causes and ventures that are social in nature. Attention is devoted to the marketing and communication challenges involved when attempting to do good, and how these issues can be overcome without spending large amounts of money. Sample topics include identifying and understanding target markets for social initiatives, constructing a value proposition, developing positioning approaches, designing communication programs, use of guerrilla techniques, the roles of price and place, and how to set goals and measure performance.  
STV 40851	This course is an introduction to political, economic, and social issues through the medium of visual displays. This kind of course has become feasible because data are now abundant and easy to access and software for displaying and analyzing data are available and easy to use. The ability to examine and display data is an increasingly valuable skill in many fields. However, this skill must be complemented by the ability to interpret visual displays orally, and by a commitment to use data responsibly: to reveal, rather than slant or distort, the truth. We will discuss examples concerning drugs, marriage, climate change, development, economic performance, social policy, democracy, voting, public opinion, and conflict, but the main emphasis is on helping you explore many facets of an issue of particular interest to you. You will learn to manage data and produce your own graphics to describe and explain political, social, economic (or other!) relationships. The graphics will include line and bar graphs, 2D and 3D scatterplots, motion charts, maps, and others.
STV 40999	Students, in a structured format, are involved in assessing, prioritizing and creatively solving problems encountered by low-income and other disadvantaged South Bend entrepreneurs. A process consulting approach is employed and a number of useful tools and frameworks are introduced. Students work with both for-profit and non-profit enterprises, producing tangible deliverables that help clients launch, grow and sustain their ventures. In addition to class time, students will meet with clients on a weekly basis at a Notre Dame facility located downtown. Assistance with transportation will be available for students needing it. Class will meet on Tuesdays. On Thursdays, students will consult with local entrepreneurs in one hour blocks during the hours of 5p to 9p at the Center for Civic Innovation. This consulting time is flexible with students' schedules and based on appointments made by local entrepreneurs.
STV 43255	We usually think of field work and excavation as being the essence of archaeology, but much of what we know about the past is learned in the laboratory, where we study the artifacts brought in from the field.  A rough rule of thumb states that two hours of lab time are needed for every hour spent in the field, so in reality, lab work may be even more important than field work in archaeology.  This course is a laboratory class that will use many different activities to teach you about how archaeologists organize, preserve, and study archaeological artifacts to learn about the past.  This class provides an in-depth introduction to basic laboratory methods for the organization, curation, and analysis of pottery, stone tools, metals, soil samples, and floral and faunal remains.  By the end of the semester, you will engage in a hands-on application of course principles by conducting a research project on materials from Notre Dame's archaeological collections.
STV 43590	Economic actions like working, buying, selling, saving, and giving are a fundamental part of everyday life, and all spheres of society, from family to religion to politics, are interrelated with economy. Sociologists examine how social relationships from small networks to transnational linkages affect economic actions and their outcomes, and the ways cultural meanings and political strategies shape those social relationships. The goal of this class is to provide students with new perspectives on economic actions by reading recent sociological studies of topics like money, markets, work, businesses, industries, and consumer society.
STV 43818	When people think about sexuality, they often adopt a biological view - seeing sexuality as &quot;driven&quot; by hormones and nature. This course adopts a different approach by viewing sexuality through the lens of sociology - as shaped by social processes, including social interaction, institutions, and ideologies. The course will focus on examining three sociological aspects of sexuality: 1) The social, historical, and cultural factors that shape sexual behaviors, desires, identities, and communities; 2) The ways in which sex and sexuality are constantly regulated and contested at multiple levels of society, including within families, schools, workplaces, and religious and political institutions; and 3) The sources, causes, and effects of sexual inequality. While our focus will be on sexuality, we will also study how other identities (including gender, race, class, religion, etc.) influence and affect it. Students will be encouraged to question their taken-for-granted assumptions about sex and sexualities and to formulate critical perspectives on issues pertaining to sexuality in today's public discourses. This course is sex-positive in that it assumes that knowledge about sexuality is empowering, not dangerous. The readings and discussions will be frank, and students will be assisted in developing a language for and comfort level with discussing a wide range of sexual topics in a respectful and sociological way. In the process, students will be challenged to improve their critical thinking, researching, writing, and public speaking skills.
STV 46497	Independent research or readings taken under the supervision of an STV faculty member.  An approved proposal for the research/readings will be filed with the STV office.  (In order to receive STV credit, the student's proposal will need to be approved by the faculty member supervising the student's research/readings and by the director of the STV program.)
STV 48497	Undergraduates will conduct research or elaborated readings on a topic of interest.
SUS 10700	World population has doubled in the last 50 years, and sustainable development in the face of global change is the greatest challenge of our time. The class provides an overview of the origin, scale and complexity of the challenge. We focus on two specific areas (water and energy), where we, as engineers, scientists and professionals, have a particularly important role to play to address that challenge. We will learn simple quantitative tools to measure and evaluate environmental and resources problems. The course will conclude by discussing the tradeoffs, ethical dilemmas and opportunities involved in factoring sustainable development into policy and engineering decisions.
SUS 20010	This interdisciplinary course explores the challenges of environmental sustainability through social, economic, scientific, and ethical lenses. Taught jointly by professors from the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences, the course aims to instill broad, integrative and critical thinking about global environmental problems whose solutions will depend on multidisciplinary approaches. This gateway course to the Minor in Sustainability is open to all students interested in a deep exploration of these critical issues. Students considering the Minor in Sustainability are encouraged to take this course during their sophomore year.
SUS 20200	Globally, the agricultural sector is the largest cause of habitat loss, aquifer depletion, and greenhouse gas emissions. The need to transform agricultural systems to meet the needs of the world's growing population while addressing these ecological impacts is one of the 21st century's grand challenges. This course will include principles, concepts and practices of sustainable food production including biodiversity, soil quality, and nutrient, water, pest and disease management, while focusing on a production culture that is environmentally regenerative. Every class meeting will involve experiential learning that will build students' skills in growing healthy food in a way that protects and restores the earth. This class will also address the environmental and social consequences of industrial farming and public health impacts of quality food accessibility in communities.
SUS 20203	Design thinking has emerged as a powerful methodology to catalyze breakthrough innovation for an array of complex business, social and humanitarian challenges. Business and industry have embraced design thinking as one of the most potent drivers of innovation, growth and prosperity for its’ deeply human-centered approach to problem solving. During this fast paced, hybrid, hands-on journey through the design thinking process, students will immerse themselves in a series of overlapping modules that introduce the various phases in the design thinking process and familiarize students with the tools and techniques. This course will unleash your creativity and ingenuity in addressing problems through a human centered framework and mindset, applying this methodology to a vast array of human-centered problems, and complementing disciplines from science and engineering to business and the liberal arts. This course fulfills a Core Curriculum Liberal Arts 4 Way of Knowing (Arts) as well as the gateway to the Collaborative Innovation minor and cross-listed with other minors including: Sustainability, Computing &amp; Digital Technologies, Education, Schooling &amp; Society, Entrepreneurship and Anthropology.
SUS 20204	Discussion of basic chemical processes occurring in the environment, particularly those relating to the impact of humanity's technological enterprise.
SUS 20626	We live and act in an ecological theater created by God that includes all other living organisms and their ecosystems within the biosphere. Urgent questions abound today about what our relationship is to the rest of the natural world. What is our place in the world? This course investigates the Christian understanding of God as Creator, creation, and our human relationship to God, one another, and the natural world. We will examine the theology of creation beginning with Scripture and the Creed and progressing through the Early Church, Medieval, and modern time periods. We will also discuss theological anthropology in terms of our identity and mission within our ecological home. To this end, we will apply Pope Francis' notion of integral ecology to the specific case of the Great Lakes watershed in which we live, examining topics such as biodiversity, water, agriculture, and energy. As ecological citizens and creatures of God, we will also address the connection between liturgy and ecology. This course will have a special appeal to students interested in the intersection of theology and science, especially ecology and environmental studies.
SUS 20888	This course investigates the Christian understanding of creation and how this doctrine relates to contemporary scientific issues. We will examine the development of the doctrine beginning with Scripture and the Creed and progressing through the early Church period into the Medieval and Scholastic era, focusing on the concepts of creation ex nihilo, creation continua, divine Providence, and divine action in the world. With the rise of the modern era, we will analyze the origin of and principles involved with the purported conflict between science and theology. We will bring the doctrine of creation into dialogue with three contemporary issues in the sciences: cosmology, evolution, and ecology. Integral to this course will be the relationship and response of humankind to God and to creation. This course will have a special appeal to students interested in the intersection of science and theology.
SUS 25000	The current generation of colleges students will face a host of challenges in their lifetimes, including a global population that will potentially reach 9 billion by the early 2040s,  depleting resources, and declining ecosystems.  Additionally, the world is currently experiencing the worst global pandemic it has faced in over a century, whose effects will linger for years to come while foreshadowing the potential impact of other impending shocks.  If current economic growth continues in a &quot;business as usual&quot; framework, future generations will face an increased dearth of decent jobs, growing social divisions, and devastating threats to the environment.    This course will explore this confluence of issues and help students to consider a new roadmap for economic development and human flourishing that respects the dignity of every individual and the environment.  Readings and lectures will look at the intersection of economic growth, industry, food security, water scarcity, health, religion, innovation science, and climate change.  Case studies and real world examples will link theory to policy and practice.    A major component of this course will be in-class discussions and case studies that will push students to think critically and debate the important questions within the study of sustainable development.  The objective of these discussions will be to a) explore the interconnectedness of many of these issues and their varying degrees of impact on the wealthy, the middle class, and the poor or marginalized; b) understand different models of governance at international, national, and local levels that are trying to work through these issues; and c) bridge theory to policy and practice.  This course requires active student participation in class as well as group projects and quizzes to gauge how well students are absorbing the material.
SUS 30112	Germany is globally recognized as a leader in the fields of renewable energy, sustainable development, and environmental protection. But how did this come about? In this course, we will examine the roles that culture and history play in shaping human attitudes towards the environment. Our case studies will range over two centuries, from damming projects in the Rhine valley at the start of the nineteenth century to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster at the end of the twentieth. We will study novels, films, and philosophical essays alongside works by leading environmental historians. Over the course of the semester, students will develop a richer understanding of German environmentalism that also includes an awareness of its dark sides, such as the role that nature conservancy played within Nazi ideology.
SUS 30113	With help from athletes such as Billie Jean King, Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James, Serena Williams, and Megan Rapinoe, Americans are growing accustomed to thinking about sports as embedded in the politics of gender, class, race, sexuality, and the nation. Consider the variety of places where sports happen, however, and the ways we develop and consume those places, and it becomes apparent that sports are also environmental in significant and complex ways. This course will examine the environmental politics of sports from conservation to climate change through the lenses of history and cultural studies. Course content will range from 19th century hunting, Indigenous surfing, and BASE jumping, to pick-up basketball, pro stadiums, and Notre Dame Athletics. Topical sections include outdoor sports and conservation, mountain sports and public land use, parks and recreation, stadiums and environmental justice, sports and climate change, and sustainability in the NCAA. Course requirements include regular reading and discussion, midterm and final essays, and a research project on a topic of the student's choice.
SUS 30202	Conserving the earth's rich biological heritage while enhancing the well-being of some of the world's poorest people stands as a critical global challenge. This course examines this complex issue using the lens of political science and related fields such as political ecology, gender studies, and sustainability science. It will demonstrate how insights and approaches from these areas of scholarship can help understand and address the twin problems of biodiversity loss and poverty in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Examples will focus on forest and wildlife conservation and management. This course will be of interest to students from a wide range of natural and social science disciplines.
SUS 30312	The study of populations and communities of organisms and their interrelations with the environment. Fall and spring.
SUS 30408	Fracking, Water Wars, Deforestation of the Amazon, Droughts, Global Warming, Climate Change, Unsustainable Agriculture, Hurricanes, Pollution, Species Extinction, Invasive Species, Poaching, Overfishing, Depletion of Fossil Fuels, Overpopulation, Wastes, Ocean Acidification, Wildfires, Oil Spills, Overpopulation, Overconsumption, Land degradation - the list goes on!  These complex environmental problems are occurring constantly and rapidly; their consequences are global in scope and transcend national boundaries; and they embody the complex relationship between humans and the natural environment. This course is about developing an interdisciplinary understanding of the relationship between humans (society) and the environment. We will examine the historical and contemporary environmental challenges of global concern, the underlying role of humans, and attempts by society to address, mitigate, and adapt to such complex problems through policies, institutions, and governance. We will pay attention to the roles of different state and non-state actors in environmental policy making. Overall, students will draw from both the social and natural sciences to develop a deeper understanding of how society - through consumption, culture, politics, power, ethics, values, economic growth, location, etc - contribute to, or solve, environmental problems.
SUS 30559	This course introduces the role of economics in environmental issues and in the formation of  environmental policy. Topics covered include choice, externalities, market failure, cost-benefit and environmental valuation analyses, and climate change. The course aims to encourage students to think about pressing environmental issues in economic terms and equip students with the diverse set of economics tools to contribute to the evaluation and implementation of wise policy choices. There is no prior knowledge of economics required, and students will have the opportunity to learn basic economic principles and frameworks that guide decision-making regarding environmental issues.  
SUS 30632	This course is an introduction to the new field of environmental history. While many people think &quot;The Environment&quot; suddenly became important with the first &quot;Earth Day&quot; in 1970 (or a few years earlier), environmental issues have in fact long been of central importance. In recent decades historians have begun actively to explore the past sensibilities of various groups toward their surroundings and fellow creatures. They have also increasingly paid attention to the ways environmental factors have affected history. This course will range widely, from world history to the story of a single river, from arguments about climate change to the significance of pink flamingos, and will survey a number of types of history including cultural, demographic, religious, and animal.
SUS 38002	This course is required for all juniors (and 4th-year Architecture students) in the Minor in Sustainability. Students will work independently on defining their capstone projects with the guidance of the instructor and their project advisor. There are no class meeting times; advisory meetings will be scheduled individually. Students will enroll in a one-credit independent study course during each semester of their senior year in order to carry out their capstone projects.
SUS 40409	A major source of conflict - increasingly so - is environmental issues; both climate change-related conflicts about (more and more scarce) resources as well as secondary conflicts (conflicts that arise because of the resource conflict, i.e. climate migrants) pose a major challenge to the planet. Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato Si has offered ways to think about an &quot;integral ecology&quot; that takes the environment, life on the planet, the human condition and culture seriously. The cry of the earth and the cry of the poor cannot be separated. Laudato Si has to be read against the background of the concept of &quot;Integral Human Development.&quot; This concept, inspired by the works of Joseph Lebret, OP, was introduced by Pope Paul VI in his encyclical Populorum Progressio (1967). It refers to &quot;the development of the whole person and the development of all persons.&quot; The course explores the connection (intersectionality) between peace, (integral) ecology, and (integral human) development. It will do so with in-class room teaching sessions and working with select case studies on integral ecology.
SUS 48001	This course is required for all seniors (and 5th-year Architecture students) in the Minor in Sustainability. Students will work independently on their capstone projects with the guidance of the instructor and their project advisor. There are no class meeting times; advisory meetings will be scheduled individually. Students will enroll in an additional credit of independent study during the spring semester in order to complete their capstone projects.
SUS 48002	This course is required for all seniors in the Minor in Sustainability. Students will work independently on their capstone projects with the guidance of the instructor and their project advisor. There are no class meeting times; advisory meetings will be scheduled individually.
TEC 20101	This course will introduce students to fundamental ethical and social issues related to the design, development, and use of technology. Students will develop an understanding of philosophical ethical theories as a resource for analyzing how technology impacts both individual and collective civil, political, and human rights and issues related to autonomy, privacy, and identity, as well as how it reinforces power dynamics in society and its impacts on equity, justice, and fairness. Specific topics will include bias and fairness in algorithms, privacy, data governance and civil liberties, surveillance and power, social media, and the ethics of artificial intelligence.
TEC 20111	&quot;Hacking&quot; is one of the most pressing topics of technological and societal interest. Yet, it is one of the most misunderstood and mischaracterized practices in the public sphere, given its ethical and technical complexities. In this course we will combine anthropological and computer science methods to explore the digital tools, practices, and sociocultural histories of hacking with a focus on their context of occurrence from the late 1960s to the present. Our goal is to help students think anthropologically about computing as well as technically about the digital mediations that we depend on in our lives.
TEC 30113	This course aims to change the way you think not only about the way that we play games, but also about the way that video games teach their players to behave within their digital worlds. This course will encourage students to reflect on and utilize their lived experiences as players, and utilize these experiences to locate themselves within their analysis and writing as well as their design practices. This course will undertake an intensive, interdisciplinary focus on the history of video game development, representation in video games, and the languages that digital games work in as well as decolonial theory and diverse theories of design. This class will engage with a variety of scholarly texts, video games, media posts, videos, and design exercises, in order to illustrate the ways in which video games have shaped the ways we play, think, and behave within their spaces. Students will be required to write and design around these lessons and address and push back against the problematic behaviors and colonial narratives around violence, race, gender, sexuality, and relationship to the land that these gamic languages and lessons have created.
TEC 30114	As artificial intelligence (AI) grows increasingly pervasive in society, it is essential that we develop an understanding of how AI systems work. A vital part of this understanding is a careful consideration of various risks (e.g., the presence of bias, a lack of transparency, regulatory compliance) when AI systems are designed and deployed in real-world settings.    To understand and address these concerns, this course introduces students to the fundamentals of AI auditing — the practice of evaluating and improving the ethics of AI systems. Through a combination of interactive discussions and semi-technical lab sessions, students will develop an auditing “toolkit”. This toolkit includes both theoretical and technical concepts, especially relevant for the increasingly interdisciplinary teams of the modern workforce. Students will work on group case assignments as “audit committees” that reflect the needs of a variety of stakeholders (e.g., developers, managers, investors, users). Groups will identify and discuss potential concerns or risks associated with AI systems as well as develop recommendations to address them.   Overall, the course aims to provide an interdisciplinary and hands-on introduction to AI auditing, allowing students to gain insights into the opportunities and challenges associated with the design and deployment of AI systems that minimize societal risk and increase their effectiveness.   
TEC 30205	The application of artificial intelligence is expanding rapidly and has the potential to reshape many fields, including transportation, finance, health care, marketing, social media, criminal justice, and public policy, just to name a few. AI's ability to predict human preference and behavior or even substitute human judgement in these fields creates opportunities as well as concerns for safety, bias and discrimination, transparency, inequality, and job loss. Designed to serve students from no background in AI to those who have existing technical background, this course surveys current and emerging applications of AI in different fields and the related ethical issues and governance problems.  The course targets students from different disciplines. Students from the humanities and social sciences will gain a deeper understanding of the technical aspects underpinning today's ethical and policy debates related to AI. Students with more technical background will better appreciate the ethical issues that arise in programming and engineering and understand how technology interacts with the broader societal contexts.  The course's goal is to encourage each student to become proactive in thinking of the societal implications of technological change and the potential roles one can play as a consumer, citizen, engineer, designer, and future business leader and policymaker.
TEC 30750	Generative AI is a form of computing in which computer systems generate media such as text, images, sound, video, or combinations based on prompts or other information provided to the computer.  These systems, including, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Midjourney &amp; DALLE, have been evolving rapidly and have led to extreme excitement, confusion, and fear. This course provides a survey of how to understand and use a number of these tools including explorations in prompt engineering.  The class will address a range of issues from across the liberal arts including artistic, economic, social/psychological, educational and legal concerns and opportunities.  
TEC 33997	This course explores ethical issues posed by the internet and online communication systems. The primary aim of the course is to identify ethical issues related to the internet and reason through different engineering, design, and policy solutions. Students will be introduced to standard normative ethical theories to provide them with a solid theoretical grounding that they can use to better understand and make sense of the applied ethical topics that will be the focus of the course. Topics covered include (but are not limited to) internet censorship, surveillance capitalism, echo chambers, fake news, online shaming, online anonymity, the digital divide, the right to be forgotten, the ethics of hacking, the metaverse, and intellectual property rights in the digital age. By the end of the course, students should be able to analyze and evaluate philosophical arguments well as write formal philosophical essays. 
TEC 33998	Traditional strategies to fight against poverty, inequality and climate change have proved ineffective in the last decades. New and creative solutions are required where cutting-edge technological innovation and multidisciplinary work serve the common good.    In this course, you will explore the state of the art in AI business development and its ethical implications in relation to current global societal and environmental challenges. You will reflect on your individual role in society and develop critical thinking about the current socio-technical value system. Our readings will include original works of philosophers, economists and computer scientists as well as examples of state-of-the-art AI supported business and institutional projects. As a result of the readings and class discussions, you will acquire well-informed understanding about the implications of the AI Trustworthy principle of justice and fairness, including non-discrimination and avoidance of unfair bias. You will become aware of the potential for AI to contribute, if well managed, towards fairer and more sustainable societies as well as the dangers it entails to widen inequalities and aggravate the discrimination suffered by vulnerable communities.   This is a hands-on course where you will be ideating and planning projects for the social good. I will accompany you in the development of business plans where ethics is the driver and AI is the key instrument. I will help you define your project idea in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Therefore, your projects will be designed to work towards mitigating poverty, reducing gender and race inequality, combating climate change, improving the sustainability of cities and communities, ensuring affordable and clean energy, achieving responsible consumption and production, improving the quality of education, providing better health and well-being services, ensuring decent work and economic growth or promoting peaceful and inclusive societies.   The goal of the course is to encourage and support you, as new entrepreneurs and future leaders, to work in multidisciplinary teams and develop interdisciplinary skills, being able to take advantage of new technology to create and manage projects for ethics in action.
TEC 33999	What happens when computing moves into new spaces of engineering, science, and medicine? In this course, students will engage with ethical questions at the intersection of computing and biotechnology as a launching pad to consider additional ethical dilemmas in other areas of engineering and propose solutions to them. This course will be grounded in an overview of the philosophy of technology and tech ethics. The focus will then shift to contemporary ethical challenges within biotech work, including big data, computational biology, and artificial intelligence. Finally, we will look toward the future and examine how technology may support a future worth wanting. The course will ask big questions such as: how does technology shape the way we see ourselves and others? Students will be equipped to reflect seriously on these topics by reading contemporary think pieces, academic journal articles, short fiction, and political theory. This course will prepare students to engage with the practical and intellectual challenges of an ethically engaged tech career. This signature course is part of the Ethics at Work Project.
TEC 40204	The new wave of technologies, e.g., robotics and AI will have long-lasting impacts on the labor market. Jobs will be displaced, new tasks will be created, different skills will be demanded, and new management practices will emerge. These new technologies may benefit workers unevenly, potentially increasing inequality. At the same time, new demographic challenges driven by aging will have large impacts on labor. How will these forces affect the future of labor and how should we prepare for changes in the labor market?  The goal of this course is to provide students with a framework for analyzing how new technologies like robotics and AI will affect the labor market drawing largely from the economics literature. Students will analyze and describe the literature on these topics and understand the different methodologies used in the literature. Ultimately, students will build perspectives on how AI and robotics could affect jobs, occupations, the future of work, income distribution and social institutions. Students will also build perspectives on education, training, and redistribution policies that can help mitigate the labor market disruptions created by technological change. Students will collect and analyze data that can provide insights on the future of labor.
TEC 40301	Data-informed decision making has created new opportunities, but also expands the set of possible risks to organizations. One of these risks comes from grappling with the &quot;should we?&quot; question with regard to data and analytics, and associated concerns with identity, privacy, ownership, and reputation. In this course, we will explore several frameworks to address the issues related to the proper roles of public law, government regulation, professional codes, organizational approaches, and individual ethics in performing and managing analytics activities. The course will cover applicable theory and guidelines, and also make use of case studies. Upon completion, the student should be comfortable adapting one of these ethical frameworks for use in alignment with their organizational mission.
THEO 10001	This first course in theology offers a critical study of the Bible and early Christian tradition. Following an introduction to the Old and New Testaments, students follow major post-biblical developments in Christian life and worship (e.g., liturgy, theology, doctrine, asceticism), emphasizing the first five centuries.
THEO 10002	This first course in theology offers a critical study of the Bible and early Christian tradition. Following an introduction to the Old and New Testaments, students follow major post-biblical developments in Christian life and worship (e.g., liturgy, theology, doctrine, asceticism), emphasizing the first five centuries.
THEO 13002	This first course in theology offers a study of the Bible and early Christian tradition. In Foundations, students reflect theologically on the Old and New Testaments and major post-biblical developments in Christian life and worship (e.g., liturgy, theology, doctrine, asceticism), emphasizing the first five centuries.  
THEO 13183	This first course in theology offers a study of the Bible and early Christian tradition. In Foundations, students reflect theologically on the Old and New Testaments and major post-biblical developments in Christian life and worship (e.g., liturgy, theology, doctrine, asceticism), emphasizing the first five centuries.  
THEO 20246	This course traces the development of the dogma of Mary's Immaculate Conception and its theological significance today. The course proceeds in four units. It first explores Christian teaching on Original Sin (the sin from which Mary is believed to have been preserved). It then examines key primary texts (Anselm, Aquinas, Duns Scotus) in the development of the Marian dogma. Third, it focusses on the Marian apparitions in 1858 at Lourdes, which occurred four years after the promulgation of the dogma by Pope Pius IX in 1854. Fourth, it studies the contemporary significance of the dogma for Christian anthropology, ecclesiology, and ecumenism.  The teaching on Mary's Immaculate Conception is shown to be interconnected to the Church's beliefs about human nature (creation, Fall, sexuality), Christ, redemption, the sacraments, and sanctification.
THEO 20249	Eastern Christians and their Churches are an indispensable part of global Christianity that sheds light on its origins, its basic theological tenets, its achievements and its historical failures, dilemmas and challenges. The course provides an overview of the variety of Eastern-rite Churches belonging to the different cultural traditions of Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. The students will be introduced to the theological views and liturgical life of Eastern-rite Christians, i.e., Orthodox, Oriental and Eastern Catholic, and their fascinating history. We shall explore the Byzantine rite Churches in more detail, and discuss the challenges their theology and history present to contemporary world and international relations. Special attention will be given to Slavic Christianity and particularly to religious history of Ukraine and of Russia. Reflections on the diversity of Christian traditions lead to important insights into theological topics of central importance for today such as theology of history, theology of culture, theology of art, ecclesiology, and sacramental theology.
THEO 20251	This course is for all students seeking to understand the Catholic faith. Catholic doctrines will be studied both individually, and towards the development of an integrated vision of the Faith as a whole. Lectures and readings hinge on theological reflection on the Catechism and other primary texts, both ancient and contemporary.
THEO 20258	Thomas Aquinas is one of the foremost theologians and teachers in the Christian tradition. This course offers a theological introduction to the teachings of the Christian faith through Aquinas's writings, covering his principal claims about God, Christ, human beings, and the Church and sacraments. This topical exploration will highlight the interconnectedness of various doctrines and the systematic quality of Aquinas's own teaching, allowing us to engage with the presentation of a coherent Christian worldview. At the same time, the course emphasizes the dynamic relation between these theological topics as reflected in the structure of the Summa theologiae: God as the beginning and end of all creatures; human beings as made to find their fulfillment in God; and Christ the incarnate God as the way of return, mediated through his sacraments and Church. The course approaches these doctrines under the integrative concept &quot;wisdom,&quot; following Aquinas's understanding of the theologian's task as one of growing in the wisdom of God. This task, which puts reason at the service of faith, constitutes an intellectual response to the divine calling of human beings to participate in the supernatural life.
THEO 20261	A historical survey of the cross and crucifix in Christian theology, popular piety, ritual practice, and art, from the New Testament though the sixteenth-century and in both eastern and western traditions. Topics include the discovery and dissemination of relics of the True Cross, the emergence and development of crucifixion iconography, hymns dedicated to the cross, and the liturgical feasts and veneration of the cross.
THEO 20268	For many Christians, sacred places have been central to their religious experience: they have visited, prayed towards, imagined, and even reproduced them in miniature. Beginning with the Bible, this course will examine the development of holy places. We will attend to historical questions (How and when did shrines develop? What did they look like? Who were the people who went on pilgrimage? What was it like to travel?), as well as to literary ones (Why did pilgrims write about their experience? What is the nature of this genre? What might have been the impact of these writings on audiences “back home”?). But our overarching questions will be theological: What does it mean to localize the holy, to believe that God is more present in some places than in others? In pursuing answers to these questions, we will look not only at texts, but also at objects—ordinary things as well fine art—and at film (commercial and documentary). In the first half of the semester, we will focus largely on the early church, looking first at the phenomenon of pilgrimage to holy people, and then at the development of the “Holy Land.” In the second half of the course, we will turn to the great pilgrimage shrines in western Europe, especially Santiago de Compostela (and its associated Camino) and Lourdes.
THEO 20619	This course examines the economic dimensions of violence in light of Catholic social teaching and Western political and economic thought.  After an in-depth overview of Catholic social teaching in relation to alternative social theories, we bring them to bear on  the issue of  violence in three social spheres: the domestic (domestic abuse and sexual assault), the economic (sweatshops), and the international political (war).  In each case we will examine Catholic responses to the problem. 
THEO 20626	We live and act in an ecological theater created by God that includes all other living organisms and their ecosystems within the biosphere. Urgent questions abound today about what our relationship is to the rest of the natural world. What is our place in the world? This course investigates the Christian understanding of God as Creator, creation, and our human relationship to God, one another, and the natural world. We will examine the theology of creation beginning with Scripture and the Creed and progressing through the Early Church, Medieval, and modern time periods. We will also discuss theological anthropology in terms of our identity and mission within our ecological home. To this end, we will apply Pope Francis' notion of integral ecology to the specific case of the Great Lakes watershed in which we live, examining topics such as biodiversity, water, agriculture, and energy. As ecological citizens and creatures of God, we will also address the connection between liturgy and ecology. This course will have a special appeal to students interested in the intersection of theology and science, especially ecology and environmental studies.
THEO 20639	This course is intended to be an introduction to Catholic moral theology customized for those discerning a career as a business professional. In the wake of ethical failures at a number of prominent corporations, business leaders have renewed their call for ethical behavior and have begun to establish criteria for hiring morally thoughtful employees and to institute ethics education in the workplace. This is a move which has prompted a number of questions. Are institutions of higher education or small groups of well-meaning business professionals capable of training people to behave ethically? Is the real problem in contemporary business a lack of ethical knowledge, a lack of skill in applying rules to particular cases, or a lack of sensitivity to morally relevant issues? In the first part of the course, we will examine philosophical, theological, and economic interpretations of our current business situation, and we will consider various approaches to thinking about the ethical dimensions of business. In the second part of the course, we will examine the tradition of Catholic theology as a virtue ethics tradition, considering how virtue relates to happiness, law, moral judgment, and one's professional vocation. Third, we will examine Catholic theologies of work and the tradition of Catholic social teaching, with special attention to the relationship between workers and management as well as the norms of justice that ought to govern these relations. The course will conclude with student presentations of original cases.
THEO 20643	This course will explore the theology and practice of nonviolence as a form of askesis, or spiritual discipline.  The material will include readings from Scripture, the early Christian tradition, and Catholic social teaching.  Religious sources outside the Christian tradition will include Gandhi and Thich Nhat Hanh. This course will use the method of community-based learning and will require twenty hours of service spread over ten weeks at particular sites in the South Bend area.
THEO 20674	More than a century before African slaves were trafficked to the Virginia colony in 1619, Christopher Columbus transported captured indigenous peoples to Spain from the New World. The dispossession and enslavement of non-Europeans in the colonization of the Americas was justified by Christians but also condemned by Christians with different economic and political interests. This development course in theology introduces students to the challenging intersection of faith, slavery, and freedom by exploring key figures, events, and movements that have shaped the complex historical legacy of Christianity in the Americas, a hemispheric past that remains ever bound together. In addition to Christianity's role in colonial expansion and racial ideology, the course especially considers how lived faith in God provided a catalyst for the empowerment and resistance of the oppressed and their advocates in shared struggles to attain greater social justice, racial equality, and political autonomy. From the &quot;Protector of the Indians&quot; Bartolomé de las Casas to César Chávez, and the &quot;Black Moses&quot; Harriet Tubman to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the course explores these and other extraordinary figures of hope in the Americas who gave their lives to protest institutional violence and promote authentic expressions of faith. In the course, students will engage this turbulent past through a contextual approach to theology that examines idolatry, migration, land, liberty, poverty, social sin, nonviolence, and solidarity as normative categories relevant for addressing contemporary social crises afflicting our nation and the earth. 
THEO 20677	This course is intended to be a second level theology course that introduces fundamental principles of  Catholic moral theology and Catholic Social Teaching, as oriented specifically for those preparing to  enter the business world. As such, students will be encouraged to think in theological categories about  business and ethics, and to appreciate how these categories bring the light of faith, in unity with the  insights of human reason, to bear on the purpose of business and the possibility of virtuous engagement  in this profession within a just and humane society.
THEO 20679	In this course, we will study the development of personal moral character and conscience through a series of guided discussions about values, decisions, habits, virtues and vices, the role of the Christian narrative, and finally, an integrated theory of Christian character formation. To illustrate the dimensions of character and conscience we will consider cases and dilemmas in the topic areas of relationships and sexuality, biomedical ethics, and justice concerns. Readings will include selections from writers in contemporary Christian ethics and cases drawn from numerous scholarly and popular sources. Requirements will include attendance at class sessions; significant participation in group discussions; several 3-5-page papers; and a 6-8-page final paper.
THEO 20680	What does it mean to live a good life, to flourish as a human being?  What does faith have to do with it?  This &quot;everyday ethics&quot; course begins by resituating morality into the context of true happiness. We then examine various virtues, with attention to how the virtuous life is distinctive in the context of the Christian faith.  We examine some particular issues (alcohol use, sexuality, end of life decisions), but our main emphasis is on how to live virtuous, fulfilling everyday lives, with careful attention to the difference faith makes in doing so.
THEO 20682	What does it mean for us to say we are human beings with personal dignity and a social nature, living in an imperfect world affected by sin? This course is an introduction to Catholic moral theology through the lens of social ethics. It aims to familiarize students with the theological foundations of eight terms that recur throughout Catholic social teaching: dignity, social nature, natural law, freedom, sin, conscience, justice, and love. Special emphasis will be placed on how these concepts are interconnected in a moral framework. Students will compare and contrast these concepts with definitions from other texts, identifying and analyzing the use of diverse definitions in debates on structural injustice, lawful resistance, gender equality, the death penalty, etc., and charting paths for realistic dialogue based on an acknowledgment of common understandings, mutual enrichment, and objective differences. 
THEO 20708	This class introduces students to the aims and methods of meditation with a particular emphasis on its Buddhist and Christian forms. It covers the stages of meditation in both traditions, their Scriptural foundations, and the wide variety of techniques used to attain contemplative states, including prayer, visualization, and the control of posture, breath, sleep, and dreams. Christian sources will include the Bible, St. Gregory of Nyssa, Evagrius Ponticus, St. John of Sinai, St. Dominic, St. Bonaventure, Gregory Palamas, St. Ignatius Loyola, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Seraphim of Sarov, and Pavel Florensky. Buddhist sources will include Tsongkhapa, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Lati Rinpoche, and other modern Tibetan authors. Special attention will also be given to recent debates about the Christian practice of yoga. 
THEO 20808	Jesus' primary audience was the first century Galilean peasantry. He spoke from the margins to the marginalized. The Christian churches have not always followed this example, opting to speak from and on behalf of the centers of power. There is, consequently, an inbuilt and ongoing tension - often fraught, yet sometimes fruitful - within Christian communities that share a common faith but experience God from different social and cultural locations. As a consequence of Western European expansion, conquest, and colonialism, Christianity in modernity has become a truly global religion, further complicating this long-standing tension. However, as Pope Francis has said, &quot;Great changes in history were realized when reality was seen not from the center but rather from the periphery. . .Truly to understand reality we need to move away from the central position of calmness and peacefulness and direct ourselves to the peripheral areas.&quot; These peripheral areas are &quot;the margins.&quot; Therefore, taking our cue from both Jesus and Pope Francis, this course will examine several fundamental Christian doctrines (e.g. sin, salvation, mercy, and Christ) as they have been articulated among peoples who have been marginalized and oppressed in modernity. Engaging these often overlooked (but no less Christian) theological traditions from the margins is important for any Christian self-understanding within the world today.
THEO 20830	The relationship between Christianity and Islam is absolutely unique, in part because of the way that Muslims challenge Christian teaching on Jesus. According to standard Islamic teaching, Jesus was not God, not a savior, and did not die on the cross. Instead, he was a Muslim prophet who predicted the coming of Muhammad. Several centuries later Muhammad came to correct the errors of Christians and to preach the same eternal religion that Jesus once taught: Islam. Muslims, in other words, have something to say to Christians: that Jesus was a Muslim and that Muhammad is a true prophet sent to the entire world. In this course, we will listen to how Muslims explain and express this idea, examine how Christians have responded through the centuries, and ask how Christians today might fruitfully promote dialogue with Islam. NO PRIOR BACKGROUND in Arabic or Islam is required for this course.
THEO 20851	Can one use the principle, “What would Jesus do?” to think about political systems, decisions and policies? In the coming election, many things are uncertain, but what is not uncertain is that religious faith, and Christian faith in particular, will be a touchstone, or perhaps better, a lightning rod, in the political debates that are already underway. This course will not focus on this or that political issue (abortion, immigration, taxation, entitlement programs, same-sex marriage), but rather will take a step back to examine the ways that Christians have thought more generally about how the obligations of their faith relate to their obligations as a citizen. We will look at some classic positions, especially of Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas, but then focus on case studies, including the polarizing debates over slavery (very conducted with reference to the Bible) in the years leading up to and during the Civil War. The goal of the course is to enable students to identify the different starting points and ways of thinking that Christians have taken, and are still taking today, to interrelate faith and politics, so that students can better understand the variety of positions, including their own ways of thinking and the positions with which they disagree.
THEO 20888	This course investigates the Christian understanding of creation and how this doctrine relates to contemporary scientific issues.  We will examine the development of the doctrine beginning with Scripture and the Creed and progressing through the early Church period into the Medieval and Scholastic era, focusing on the concepts of creation ex nihilo, creation continua, divine Providence, and divine action in the world.  With the rise of the modern era, we will analyze the origin of and principles involved with the purported conflict between science and theology.  We will bring the doctrine of creation into dialogue with three contemporary issues in the sciences: cosmology, evolution, and ecology.  Integral to this course will be the relationship and response of humankind to God and to creation.  This course will have a special appeal to students interested in the intersection of science and theology.
THEO 20889	The Christian confession of a God of infinite love and goodness seems to be severely challenged by the immensity of suffering and evil. This course explores different theological responses to the theoretical and practical problems presented by suffering and evil. Attention will also be given to how psychology, Scripture, Buddhism, and film have addressed these issues. The format of the course will consist of lectures, discussions, and the close reading and analysis of seminal texts.
THEO 20894	That they may be one: this is the climax of the prayer Jesus prayed on the night before he died (see John 17:22). The Catholic imagination contemplates Jesus' prayer, both as a gift and a task for communion. This course examines the dynamics of communion in Catholicism. We begin with a prelude that introduces many of the themes to follow: the issue of perspective, the question of identity, the willingness to see and to change, and the power of mercy, to name a few. From there, the first part of the course names the problem and promise of belief, foregrounding how the objective content of the Catholic faith calls forth an ever-increasing subjectivity. A brief examination of the default state of desire and religiosity in the modern setting provides an opportunity for contemporary cultural analysis and shows how the dynamics of communion are vitiated through subtle but decisive modifications to the quality of belief. The final part of the course attends to the modes of persuasion made present in a good world that is fallen but being redeemed. In sum, the Catholic imagination hears Jesus' prayer as action and not just words, or rather the action of the Word as the keynote of communion: And the Word became flesh (John 1:14). Participation is restricted to students training to be mentors in the McGrath Institute's Vision program.
THEO 20895	In the wake of the Holocaust, the Catholic Church put its relationship with the Jewish people on a new footing with the declaration Nostra Aetate, wherein the Church calls to mind &quot;the bond that spiritually ties the people of the New Covenant to Abraham's stock.&quot;  In this course we will explore the nature of this bond, and put into practice the call to dialogue that, according to Nostra Aetate, follows from it.  The substantive goals of this course are two.  First, we will study what Christians have thought, and what Christianity - especially Catholicism - has taught across the centuries about Jews and Judaism, and about the relationship between the Church and its Jewish roots.  Second, we will learn about the teachings and practices of Judaism, from the early Christian centuries to today, and engage in theological comparison between Christian and Jewish theology.
THEO 20896	This course investigates the relationship between the Catholic Faith and modern science for the sake of an integrated worldview in which they are brought into a &quot;relational unity,&quot; i.e. a dynamic interchange in which their distinct perspectives and methods are carefully respected. We will begin with historical, philosophical, biblical and theological resources for engaging science from the perspective of faith. These will be brought into dialogue with modern cosmology, evolutionary biology and the sciences of human origins in an attempt to forge a holistic perspective in which science, philosophy and theology are treated as distinct but mutually enriching paths to truth. Specific topics will include the conflict model of science and religion, the Galileo Affair, the biblical creation accounts, the doctrines of divine creation and divine providence, and the human person as the image of God.
THEO 27841	This is the pre-course for the Theology Summer course taking place in Jerusalem: THEO 24841 Church of All Nations
THEO 30021	Study, rehearsal, and performance of sacred choral music of high quality from plainchant through music composed in the 21st century. Membership in the 65-voice SATB ensemble is by audition and limited to undergraduate and graduate students. The choir sings each Sunday at the 10:00 a. m. Solemn Mass at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, for Sunday evening vespers, and at special University liturgies and concerts throughout the year.
THEO 30022	The University of Notre Dame Women's Liturgical Choir, under the direction of Andrew McShane, is a group of approximately 60 women who lead the liturgical music for the Saturday 5 p.m. Vigil Mass in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. The Women's Liturgical Choir is also heard at Sunday Vespers, weddings, Junior Parent's Weekend, Advent lessons, and carols and other special University liturgies. Each spring semester, the choir tours within the United States, and at the end of the academic year presents a concert of sacred music at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. The repertoire of the Women's Liturgical Choir includes chant, renaissance polyphony, and music from the 18th through 20th centuries. Rehearsals are held on Monday and Wednesday evenings from 5 to 6:30 p.m. and on Saturday's from 4 to 5 p.m. in Room 329 of the Coleman-Morse Center. If you are a female student, staff, or faculty member from the Notre Dame, St. Mary's or Holy Cross family and are interested in joining the choir, please contact Andrew McShane at 1-7800 or e-mail mcshane.1@nd. edu.
THEO 30023	Work with the folk choir, which continues to build the repertoire for Catholic school use. Class meets for seven weeks. (Second summer elective)
THEO 30024	Study, rehearsal, and performance of gospel music for liturgical purposes. 
THEO 30228	Has God &quot;called me from the womb&quot; and &quot;named my name&quot; (Isa. 49:1)? How can I know God's will for my life, recognize and respond to God's call? What choices do I face and how am I to be guided in making them? What is included in the process of my vocation (sex, talents, education, profession, relationships, circumstances, dreams and desires)? This course combines three elements: (1) an introduction into forms of prayer conducive to discernment, (2) the reading and discussion of essays about vocation and discernment, and (3) interviews with women who have discerned (and continue to discern) their personal vocations. The course is designed to focus on vocations (lay and religious) open to women.
THEO 30231	This one credit course will examine Augustine's Confessions during the class sessions. The only writing for the course will be the student's own spiritual autobiography essay.
THEO 30608	The point of this course is that the Eucharist—the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ—commits us to work for justice and peace for the poor, workers, the unborn, immigrants, refugees, and the entire earth. The course is built around five public lectures with Drs. Clemens Sedmak, Margaret Pfeil, William Cavanaugh, Fr. Daniel Groody, C.S.C., and Bishop Daniel Flores of Brownsville, Texas. These public lectures will be followed by personal conversations with the class.  The first class meets on Wednesday, January 17 (4:30-5:30) and five more Wednesdays : January 31, February 14, February 28, March 20, and April 17. The public lectures begin at 4:30, followed by Q &amp; A, and class conversations conclude by 7:00. Dinner (pizza, salads, cookies, drinks) will be served. Requirements for this course include one-page responses to the lectures and one final reflection essay, oral conversation, or group discussion to be arranged with the instructor.
THEO 33963	Solidarity and the City explores the principle and practice of solidarity in the context of U.S. cities. Students will examine the root causes of poverty and injustice in urban areas, will work on individual and group assignments that apply that learning to specific issues of justice, and will participate in a Spring Break immersion to a city to learn/work alongside partners engaging issues of particular importance in context.
THEO 40003	This is the second of a two-semester introductory course in Biblical Hebrew; under normal circumstances, the student must complete the first in order to enroll in the second. In addition to the completion of Lambdin's elementary grammar, students are introduced to some (modified) Biblical texts. 
THEO 40005	This fourth-semester course in biblical Hebrew will continue and build upon THEO 40004. While the latter was devoted to the reading of biblical prose, this installment of Intermediate Hebrew will introduce students to the beauty of biblical Hebrew poetry. Our efforts will be focused on the preparation, oral reading, and translation of selected biblical passages. But time also will be spent continuing to review basic grammar as well as developing an appreciation of syntax and poetic structure (e.g., parallelism) in this powerful medium of prayer, prophetic revelation, and the quest for Wisdom in ancient Israel. 
THEO 40108	How did the New Testament come to be? This course will offer a critical introduction to the documents that make up the canon of the New Testament, considering questions of both origin (authorship, date, circumstances) and content (structure, purpose, theology). Beginning with the earliest traditions about Jesus, the course will in turn examine Jesus, the Pauline writings, the Gospels and Acts, and Hebrews to Revelation. Attention will also be paid to familiarising students with basic methodological approaches.
THEO 40135	No book of the Old Testament has proven to be more important for the understanding of Jesus of Nazareth than that of the prophet Isaiah. We shall examine the teachings of the prophet in their historical and Jewish contexts in to order to understand more deeply why why the book has proved so important for Christian theology.
THEO 40136	This course offers a chance for sustained, careful interpretation of one of richest and most enigmatic books of the Christian canon, the Book of Revelation. We will together consider the genre and purpose of the text, and above all read the Greek together and patiently consider exegetical issues as they arise. Prior knowledge of Greek is a prerequisite.
THEO 40202	The course will examine the development of the Christian tradition from the time of the Reformation to the present (to Vatican II, maybe?).  Particular topics from which instructors will choose to focus this journey include:  the confessional division of the western Christian tradition during the Reformation and the responses that post-Reformation traditions make to the secularization of Western culture (reflected in many Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment philosophies, in the rise of modern science, and in the increasing secularization of politics in the modern nation state).  The objective of the course is to develop a sense of the principal challenges and some of the diverse responses to those challenges that have shaped the on-going theological reflection of the church. 
THEO 40208	Catholicism and The City is an Architecture course intended primarily but not exclusively for undergraduate and graduate architecture students, and for undergraduate students from other disciplines. Viewed through the lenses of Catholic metaphysics and social teaching, the norms of historic classical humanist architectural and urban theory and practice, and related contemporary academic disciplines, the course is an introduction to cities generally, and more specifically a typological and historical introduction to the physical and spatial characteristics of the traditional urbanism of western Christendom, its global expansion, present devolution, and future prospects. The course addresses generally the nature and purpose/s of cities as cooperative human artifacts embodying particular cultural ideals and related forms of economic and political organization; and considers specifically cities as they relate to a Catholic understanding of human flourishing grounded in truths about God, creation, and human nature, including strategies for urbanism in a post-urban world in which human beings can flourish in towns and city neighborhoods that both anticipate and sacramentally participate in the City of God.
THEO 40209	An upper-level seminar exploring themes related to issues in sacred architecture. The course is open to architecture students and students in other disciplines.
THEO 40223	This course looks at visions of church and Christian life in ecclesiology and spiritual theology from the Council of Trent to the present.
THEO 40225	In what sense, can we call Dante a “theologian”? According to medieval theology, what is the role of “beauty” in the promotion of “holiness”? This course will consider these questions through reading a series of medieval theological discussions of holiness and beauty (especially as found in Boethius, Dionysius the Areopagite, and the Franciscan tradition). We will also explore how such ideas were translated into spirituality (Franciscan), the visual arts (Giotto), and poetry (Dante). Against such a background, we can come to appreciate why modern theologians are “re-categorizing” Dante, making arguments that we should read him not as a poet but as a theologian.
THEO 40287	The Eucharist stands at the heart of western European Christianity in the high middle ages. The insistence of church officials on regular reception of the Eucharist; the numerous scholastic treatments of the theoretical issues associated with the Eucharist; the recourse by spiritual authors, especially women, to the Eucharist to express their most profound religious and devotional insights; the pointed reference to the Christ Eucharistically-present to establish Christian identity and to distinguish the members of Christ from others, both within and outside of western Europe; the development of new rituals focussed on aspects of the Eucharist; the burgeoning of artistic representations of Eucharistic themes—all testify to the centrality of the Eucharist in medieval theological and religious consciousness. Through the close reading of representative texts by a wide variety of 13th-century authors, and, the study of the different kinds of 'Eucharistic' art, this course examines the uses made of the Eucharist by a broad spectrum of high medieval Christians. A special concern of the course is the relation between Eucharistic doctrine and religious practice—to what extent have teachings about transubstantiation and real presence shaped religious expression? how has religious experience itself occasioned the refinement of these doctrines?
THEO 40437	A study of the music composed for the Mass, the Office hours (primarily Vespers), and the Requiem Mass from the Middle Ages to the present day. The musical repertoire of each era is examined both from a purely musical standpoint and in light of the reactions of various popes, from John XXIII through Pius X, to the sacred music of their day. Documents on sacred music issued after Vatican II also are examined in relation to postconciliar church music for both the choir and the congregation.
THEO 40613	The primary goal of this course is to familiarize students with the tradition of Catholic social teaching with a view toward developing skills for critical reading and appropriation of these documents.  We will examine papal, conciliar, and episcopal texts from Rerum novarum (1891) up to the present time, identifying operative principles, tracing central theological, ethical, and ecclesial concerns, and locating each document in its proper historical context.  We will also hold recurring themes in conversation with the broader theoretical framework of Catholic social thought and relevant secondary literature.
THEO 40632	Since the beginning of humankind, people have asked, why am I here? Where am I going? And how am I called to live my life? What is God calling me to do? In more recent times these enduring questions have been rearticulated around issues of meaning, purpose, human flourishing, and the search to know God's will. Although the culture holds out images of success, fulfillment, and happiness, the quest to discover our heart's desire and make a lasting impact on the world is often elusive. Not infrequently we can make professional, material and financial progress, but at the same time regress in spiritual, ethical and human development. How can we tap into the deeper rivers and sometimes muddy waters within us and wade into the current that leads us to find our most authentic selves and discover the flow of our life's calling? This course is about the inner and outer development that leads into these waters. It will involve both personal reflection and communal connection. When we experience a deep connection to our work and a consistent flow between our life's energies and our daily tasks, we are the most alive, at peace, and whole. &quot;The place God calls you,&quot; Frederick Buechner once wrote, &quot;is the place where your deep gladness and the world's deep hunger meet.&quot; But how do we discover our own unique gifts and respond to the hungers of our world? What decisions must we make, and what discernment must we undertake, to find our way? How do we encounter the path that will lead us to integrate both our heart's desire and our desire for social change? This course is designed to help you with these questions.  Drawing on Theology, Spirituality, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, and Design Thinking, we will explore how others have asked these questions before us and how we can explore these questions today. We will use readings, lectures, class discussions, films, learning exercises, papers, and guest speakers to help you discover your talents, values, and vocation, and dream about how you can make a difference in the world.  Although we will look to others for insight, the primary text of this course is your own life, and you will be expected to thoroughly and regularly examine who you are, what you believe, and what you feel called to live out as a human being. In addition to human experience and the expertise of the social sciences, we will look to the wisdom of the great religious traditions to aid you in the process of self-discovery. Our goal is not just to give you more information but to assist you in the process of formation that is directed towards personal and social transformation. As you work at integrating the heart, the mind, the will, and the spirit, we wish to foster a vision of justice, which—from a theological point of view— is about seeking right relationship with God, others, ourselves, and the world around us.ld.
THEO 40634	To imagine is to form a mental concept of something which is not present to the senses. Imagination therefore deals with &quot;framing&quot;.  Like everyone else, Africans ponder over their condition and their world on the basis of their experience, history, social location and other realities which provide the &quot;frame&quot; through which they construct and address reality. In this course, through the study of some significant African literary works and some literary works about Africa we  will study the self-perception of  the African and the way the African has ethically viewed his / her reality and tried to grapple with it over a period of time  (colonialism, post colonialism, apartheid)  with regard to various issues on the continent (political challenges, religion, war and peace) and over  some  of the social questions (class, urbanization/ city life, sex and sexuality, relationship of the sexes), etc. We will read such authors as Joseph Conrad, Amos Tutuola,  Chinua Achebe, Athol Fugard, Wole Soyinka, Cyprian Ekwensi, Chimamanda Adichie, Syl Cheney-Coker, Tsitsi Dangaremga, Nawal El Sadawi, Ferdinand Oyono , and some others. Using these and many authors we will ask questions about what constitutes the moral imagination, how such an imagination is manifested in or apparent in the social, personal and religious lives of the various African peoples or characters portrayed in these literary works; to what extent the moral sense has helped/ conditioned or failed to influence the lives of these peoples and characters. We will also inquire into the extent and in what ways the writers in our selection have helped to shape the moral imagination of their people.
THEO 40646	This course is the seminar version of ECON 30150. In this course we will discuss the relationship between economics and Catholic social teaching. We will learn about key principles in Catholic social thought, read key Papal encyclicals and other writings. We will then discuss key economic concepts and empirical facts known from the field of economics, and how these relate to Catholic social teaching. Finally, we will apply these ideas to discussions on labor, capital, finance, the environment, globalization, and development
THEO 40665	This course examines the dynamic and distinctive contributions of Latin American theology during the last half century through the writings of Pope Francis focused on poverty and creation. Beginning with the reception of Vatican II in Latin America at the region’s episcopal meetings, the course explores the theological currents that emerged in response to the socioeconomic, cultural, political, and ecological challenges of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Pope Francis’s Argentine “theology of the people” in conversation with liberation theology, Catholic social teaching, and eco-theology introduces students to an array of theologians such as Juan Carlos Scannone, Gustavo Gutiérrez, Maria Clara Bingemer, St. Oscar Romero, Leonardo Boff, and Ivone Gebara. Topics to be considered include ecclesiology, option for the poor, theological method, martyrdom, religious pluralism, popular piety, structural sin, integral ecology, spirituality, human rights, and Indigenous wisdom. Overall, the course considers Latin American theology as a source of reform, renewal, and reflection on the signs of the times for the global Church.
THEO 40726	In 1965, the Second Vatican Council issued a &quot;Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions&quot;, which contains a statement that Muslims &quot;submit wholeheartedly to even His inscrutable decrees, just as Abraham, with whom the faith of Islam takes pleasure in linking itself, submitted to God.&quot; While the Declaration can be understood as recognizing the possible validity of Islam's claim to Abrahamic status, some scholars have introduced the notion of &quot;Abrahamic religions&quot; as a way of associating Judaism, Christianity and Islam as related faiths. This course will explore the defining features of the Abrahamic religions that tie them closely together as well as their particularities and differences. As the youngest of the three Abrahamic religions, Islam has a lot of things to say about Abraham which largely correspond to the Biblical story although the Qur'an also contains some novel features, including the claim that Abraham, together with Ishmael, built the Ka‘bah. This course will discuss how the scriptures of the three religions emerged within the same cultural milieu, and explore their intertwined histories and the ways in which Jews, Christians, and Muslims developed their own independent religious identities from their early encounters to the present. Students will also be introduced to some basic teachings of Islam. No prior knowledge of Islam is required.
THEO 40729	Abraham Heschel’s assertion that “no religion is an island” is especially true of modern Judaism. From Moses Mendelssohn’s defense of religious freedom to Heschel’s support of the civil rights movement, modern Jewish theology is characterized by an ongoing dialogue with other faith traditions, especially Christianity. This course explores the diverse manifestations of modern Jewish theology and its dialogical contextualizations from the eighteenth century to the present. We will read and analyze seminal works by Heschel, Mendelsohn, Martin Buber, Franz Rosenzweig, Margarete Susman, and Emmanuel Levinas, among others. In each case, we will analyze their reliance on diverse ancient, medieval, and modern traditions. Topics to be discussed include the theology of praxis, modern messianism and mysticism, political theology, theological ethics, theories of religious language, and Jewish existentialism. In addition to providing access to texts and ideas that continue to shape contemporary Judaism, the arc of the course invites reflective wrestling with its core definitions: What should we consider modern in the context of Jewish thought? What speculation amounts to a system we can call theology? Does modern interreligious dialogue blur the boundary between Christian and Jewish theology? And if so, what makes certain ideas Jewish?
THEO 40730	"In <a href=""/search/?p=AD%201095"" data-action=""result-detail"" data-group=""code:AD 1095""  class=""notoffered"">AD 1095</a>, the Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Alexius Comnenus sent a letter to Pope Urban II, asking for succor from Latin Christendom in order to repel the Muslim invaders who were overrunning his empire. Pope Urban II did not merely comply with this request, but transformed it into a call to restore to Christendom the lands of Christianity's origin, which had been lost to Muslim rule in the seventh century. In doing so, Pope Urban inspired and unleashed an outpouring of religious fervor- and bloodshed- unique in the annals of Christian history. This course will be dedicated to the examination of this extraordinary movement, from the initial overwhelming response it aroused among Christians across Europe through the fall of Acre in 1291. Among the issues it will explore are the historical, political, and ideological background to the Crusades, in Byzantium, Europe, and the Islamic world; The Peasants' Crusade and the Children's Crusade; the Latin principalities in the Near East, their organization and societies; interactions between Muslims and Christians; the status and treatment of religious minorities; the legend of Prester John and how it inaugurated the beginning of the European exploration of Central and Eastern Asia; the Italian communes and growth of commerce; the military orders; the career of St. Louis in the Near East; the Ayyubid and Mamluk sultanates and the geopolitical consequences of the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century; and more. Students will spend the second half of the course researching and writing a capstone research paper utilizing primary sources in translation."
THEO 40777	In the anthropological study of religion, does having a religious background benefit a researcher or does it introduce bias? Where does theology belong in the anthropology of religion, and what might the two learn from each other? Can one critically study a faith and live it at the same time? This course addresses these questions through a review of the lives and work of prominent anthropologists who identified as Catholic and drew inspiration from their Catholic faith. In examining how these anthropologists shaped the discipline, students will learn about the wide breadth of the anthropological study of religion, an endeavor that stretches from the origins of our species to the high-tech world in which we now live. This disciplinary survey will also lead to questions of how, through these particular anthropologists, insights from the anthropology of religion intersect, complicate, and enrich the Catholic intellectual tradition.
THEO 40810	An exploration of how the voices of women have helped to reshape theological discourse and to bring to light new dimensions of the living Christian tradition. Using writings of feminist, womanist, Latina, mujerista, Asian, and &quot;Third World&quot; theologians, the course will focus on the significance of gender and social location in understanding the nature and sources of theology, theological anthropology, Christology/soteriology, the mystery of God, and women's spirituality.
THEO 40823	In A Secular Age, Catholic philosopher of religion Charles Taylor traces the rise of secularity in the West, examining how we have come to inhabit an age where disbelief in the transcendent is not only optional, but the default setting for many. Through the vantage point of literature, this course will consider the arc traced by Taylor and explore how the shift from enchanted cosmos to disenchanted universe is manifest in the content and form of literary works themselves. Assigned works of fiction and poetry will be enjoyed and discussed in their own right, and also in light of Taylor’s narrative of secularity. A key focus of the course will be encountering modern literary responses to what Taylor calls “the immanent frame,” with particular attention to texts that seem to crack open that frame and recover--or at least glimpse--a reenchanted cosmos.
THEO 40828	Is religion necessary to live a moral life?  If so, are all religions basically the same when it comes to the moral norms contained in them?  If not, how do we account for the differences among religious values, norms and principles?  How do religions justify their distinctive moral claims in the face of alternative proposals?  Can we study the ethical thought of a religious tradition that is different from our own in a responsible manner and, if so, how should we proceed?  This course will take up these and other related questions through an examination of ancient and contemporary Christian and Buddhist texts in dialogue with recent theoretical options for the comparative study of ethics.  We will begin with an assessment of the importance and distinctive quality of religious voices in moral debate and then look at some of the ways that contemporary scholars have approached the investigation and assessment of similarities and differences in moral world views.  The course will end with a comparative consideration of certain Buddhist and Christian options in environmental ethics.
THEO 40861	This course is offered as an introduction to Christian Spirituality (or Spiritual Theology) with a systematic focus on its nature, stages, and goal; an historical focus on different traditions and representative figures; a thematic focus on the kinds of language and literary figures that are used to describe the spiritual life (e.g., in terms of a journey, mountain-climbing, kinds of relationships, etc.), and a practical focus on the disciplines that cultivate the spiritual life and are conducive to its end.  Other than Scripture, various saints, poets, and spiritual authors to be read and discussed include: Augustine, Guigo II, Gregory of Nyssa, Antony of Egypt, the Desert Fathers, Symeon the New Theologian, Catherine of Siena, Gregory Palamas, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, Thérèse of Lisieux, and Elizabeth of the Trinity.
THEO 40870	This 3 credit hour seminar course is designed to explore how helping professionals articulate, cultivate, and rely on their spirituality or philosophy of caring as they participate in the work of helping and healing others. We will study how helping professionals rely on a spirituality of caring in order to help them maintain and cultivate their compassion in their work in the face of suffering and the problem of evil. An overall model for a spirituality/philosophy of caring will be presented and then explored as it is exemplified in various spiritual and philosophical traditions. The course is not intended to be an exhaustive survey of all spiritual traditions, but as an introductory opportunity for the student to understand the role of spirituality in helping work and to begin to articulate their own spirituality of caring in preparation for helping professions. The course is designed especially for the preprofessional student as well as anyone who is preparing for work in a helping profession. We will rely on readings from Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism as well as other traditions and philosophies, and also will examine writings by people who have reflected on the practical aspects of living out a spirituality of caring.
THEO 40881	This course is an extended study of beauty as it relates to the nature of being and the nature of God, with considerations of the divine nature as trinitarian as well as certain Christological and pneumatological dimensions.  Alongside Plato, Plotinus, Basil of Caesarea, St. John of Damascus, Augustine, Bonaventure, Dante, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Joseph Ratzinger (as well as engagement with art, novels, and poetry), we will explore themes which include the coincidence of the transcendental of beauty with truth and goodness, as well as the intersections between beauty and nature, beauty and creativity, beauty and suffering, beauty and sanctity/sainthood, and beauty and structures of human desire. The course seeks to overcome notions inherited from modern aesthetic developments of what the category of beauty can in fact signify: that is, it will presuppose an understanding of beauty that is not merely superficial, frivolous, or subjective, but rather a category and a phenomenon with immense ontological and theological depths.
THEO 40883	This course is an extended study of the phenomenon of death as it relates to human being, human experience, and the human relationship with God. Alongside sources from the Jewish and Christian theological traditions, we will engage philosophical, theoretical, spiritual, and comparative religious perspectives. The course will be composed of four units: (1) Death and Finitude, which concerns death as a structural feature of human nature and existence, (2) Death and Subjectivity, which concerns the manner by which conduct ourselves and compose our self-understanding with respect to our mortality, (3) Death in Comparison, which concerns the role and understanding of death in other religious traditions, and (4) Death and the Theological Virtues, which will explore the relationship between death and faith, hope, and love. The course seeks to cultivate an intellectually robust, conceptually sophisticated, yet distinctly Christian theory of death, its meaning, and its inevitability.
THEO 43001	The Theology Proseminar is a one-credit course required of Theology majors and open only to Theology majors. It is designed to expose majors to the range of the field and its diverse methods, to encourage them to consider research possibilities as potential writers of honors theses or other large projects, to help them appreciate the efforts of their peers who are writing honors theses, and to connect their academic education in theology to the broader global contexts in which they live.
THEO 43205	This course pairs two extraordinary Jewish women philosophers of the World War II period who died during the period of Nazi persecution—Stein (1891-1942) in Auschwitz, and Weil (1901-1943) in England. Both studied under (and with) noted male philosophers—Husserl, Heidegger, Scheler, Von Hildebrand, and Alain, among others—and they developed their original insights on empathy and education (Stein), decreation and affliction (Weil) partly in response to their teachers. Both women struggled with their Jewish identity—Weil exemplifying an unconventional Christian Platonism and mysticism, Stein becoming a Catholic nun and canonized saint. Both wrote autobiographies. Literary and artistic criticism, meditations on mystical writings and experiences, and creative expressions (poetry and plays), as well as important essays on politics, philosophy, and theology belong to their fertile writings. Their lives and letters have inspired, in turn, the creative expressions of others: novels, plays, and poetry. Their intellectual quests in the shadow of the Holocaust led them to take up theological questions, studying St. Thomas Aquinas, Dionysius the Areopagite, St. John of the Cross (Stein), St. Francis, Bernanos, Marx, Plato, and Pascal (Weil). The answers they gave to God and others testify to the heroism and brilliance of their spiritual searches for truth and help to explain their continuing influence within the Church.
THEO 45001	In this one-credit course, students will work as research apprentices with a particular faculty member on specific research projects.
THEO 46002	This course consists of research and writing on an approved subject under the direction of a faculty member.
THEO 48002	Under the direction of a faculty member, students define a topic, undertake independent research, and write a thesis. This course is largely for the joint THEO-PHIL major who chooses to write the senior thesis in theology. It may be used in other special circumstances.
THEO 48003	Dedicated to the completion and defense of an Honors Thesis.
THEO 60003	This is the second of a two-semester introductory course in Biblical Hebrew; under normal circumstances, the student must complete the first in order to enroll in the second. In addition to the completion of Lambdin's elementary grammar, students are introduced to some (modified) Biblical texts.
THEO 60018	The second semester of Intermediate Hebrew aims to further solidify students' grammatical knowledge, to enlarge students' store of Biblical Hebrew vocabulary, to enhance prose reading fluency, and to other varieties of Hebrew (biblical poetry, unpointed Hebrew, post-biblical Hebrew).
THEO 60102	The course is a graduate-level introduction to the history and literature of the early Christian movement. The focus of the course will be on the writings contained in the New Testament, and an attempt will be made to understand these writings as historical documents within their social and theological setting.    The purposes of the course are (1) to provide insight into the cultural and religious matrix of early Christianity, (2) to develop a basic knowledge of the New Testament writings with respect to their literary and theological characteristics, and (3) to provide an introduction to the contemporary critical study of the New Testament.    The course is composed of five major segments: (1) The Jewish Matrix of Early Christianity, (2) Jewish Messianism and the Ministry of Jesus, (3) Jesus in the Memory of the Early Church, (4) Paul and the Spread of Christianity, and (5) Ethics, Eschatology, and Early Catholicism.    Students who successfully complete this course will (1) demonstrate a basic understanding of the material covered in each of the course's five major segments; (2) develop analytical skills and intellectual capacities in regard to the history and literature of the early Christian movement, including the ability to analyze the New Testament as a collection of historical documents with distinctive literary and theological characteristics; and (3) enhance their ability to engage in informed discussion of the New Testament by honing their critical thinking skills in regard to early Christianity.
THEO 60192	This course is a study of the prophetic books of Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi, prophets at the time of Israel's return to Jerusalem and also prophets of the return of the Lord to his Temple. As well as working closely through these books in English, we will consider their relationship to the rest of the Church's two-Testament Scripture, their place in Catholic liturgy, and their use in preaching.
THEO 60193	This course offers a chance for sustained, careful interpretation of one of richest and most enigmatic books of the Christian canon, the Book of Revelation. We will together consider the genre and purpose of the text, and above all read the Greek together and patiently consider exegetical issues as they arise. Prior knowledge of Greek is a prerequisite.
THEO 60194	This course considers questions of the origin (authorship, date, circumstances), and content (structure, purpose, theology) of the Gospel of John; 1, 2, 3 John, and the Apocalypse (Book of Revelation).
THEO 60213	The Eucharist stands at the heart of western European Christianity in the high middle ages. The insistence of church officials on regular reception of the Eucharist; the numerous scholastic treatments of the theoretical issues associated with the Eucharist; the recourse by spiritual authors, especially women, to the Eucharist to express their most profound religious and devotional insights; the pointed reference to the Christ Eucharistically-present to establish Christian identity and to distinguish the members of Christ from others, both within and outside of western Europe; the development of new rituals focused on aspects of the Eucharist; the burgeoning of artistic representations of Eucharistic themes—all testify to the centrality of the Eucharist in medieval theological and religious consciousness. Through the close reading of representative texts by a wide variety of 13th-century authors, and, the study of the different kinds of 'Eucharistic' art, this course examines the uses made of the Eucharist by a broad spectrum of high medieval Christians. A special concern of the course is the relation between Eucharistic doctrine and religious practice—to what extent have teachings about transubstantiation and real presence shaped religious expression? How has religious experience itself occasioned the refinement of these doctrines?
THEO 60232	The course studies the theological works of two important early Church theologians: Athanasius and Gregory of Nyssa.
THEO 60401	This course integrates historical, theological, and pastoral approaches to general sacramental theology and considers as examples the rites of particular sacraments of the contemporary Roman Catholic Church. The course will examine the nature of sacramental symbol in both the tradition and the modern, multicultural world.
THEO 60403	This course will trace the origins, historical development and theological interpretations of the rituals employed over the past two millennia for making an individual into a Christian. We will first examine various traditions of ritual washing and anointing in Second Temple Judaisms, as well as broader Greco-Roman practices of ritual bathing in order to provide the contextual landscape for the emergence of early Christian Initiation rites. We will then sift the New Testament texts and study them alongside other early Christian ritual evidence beyond the Canon. We will read and analyze early liturgical sources in detail, and trace historical changes and developments through the Middle Ages and the Reformation. The course will also give ample consideration to comparing Western Christian developments and theological accents to those in Eastern rites (Byzantine, Coptic, East-Syrian, etc.), and will also study liturgical spaces (e.g. historic baptisteries, including archeological work), and their imagery across ancient, medieval and early modern societies. Finally, in light of the course's historical investigation, various contemporary forms of Christian Initiation will be considered theologically with an eye toward pastoral implications.
THEO 60453	&quot;Lumen Gentium&quot; says that in the Church, &quot;the life of Christ is poured into the believers who, through the sacraments, are united in a hidden and real way to Christ who suffered and was glorified&quot; (7). This course will look at the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church as the means whereby Christians are mystically united to the life of Christ. Although we will use a historical framework to organize our material, the main focus of attention will be on the theological dimensions of each sacrament. This will give us the opportunity both to examine particular questions that conditioned the development of current sacramental theology, and the content of each rite as it exists today. Some attention will be paid to the nature of sacramental symbol in general, but the course's primary focus is on the sacraments as liturgical rites by which Christian life is celebrated. 
THEO 60601	This course introduces the history and patterns of thought that provide the foundations for contemporary discussions about moral theology in the Roman Catholic Church.  Its central aim will be to position moral theology as a practical and pastoral expression of Christian faith, but also as a tradition of inquiry relevant to wider discussions about moral matters in the academy and in society.  Topics to be considered include: sources for moral theology, genres of moral writing, the nature of the human person and her relationship to the community of disciples, the dynamics of moral action, and the topics of freedom, experience, authority, virtue, and forgiveness.  Course requirements include two short reflection papers and a final research paper, which may be customized to students' own ongoing pastoral and/or academic questions.
THEO 60609	In this course we will explore the relationship between Christian ethics and pastoral ministry in the Church. Following a general review of pertinent foundational themes in Christian ethics and Catholic moral theology, including conscience, sin, scripture and the moral life, natural law, and the authority of Church teaching, we will consider a number of ethical issues which have pastoral dimensions. Specifically, we will focus on effective pastoral translation of Church teaching and moral theology in the areas of Catholic health care and sexuality.
THEO 60614	The primary goal of this course is to familiarize students with the tradition of Catholic social teaching with a view toward developing skills for critical reading and appropriation of these documents.  We will examine papal, conciliar, and episcopal texts from Rerum novarum (1891) up to the present time, identifying operative principles, tracing central theological, ethical, and ecclesial concerns, and locating each document in its proper historical context.  We will also hold recurring themes in conversation with the broader theoretical framework of Catholic social thought and relevant secondary literature.
THEO 60621	Is religion necessary to live a moral life?  If so, are all religions basically the same when it comes to the moral norms contained in them?  If not, how do we account for the differences among religious values, norms and principles?  How do religions justify their distinctive moral claims in the face of alternative proposals?  Can we study the ethical thought of a religious tradition that is different from our own in a responsible manner and, if so, how should we proceed?  This course will take up these and other related questions through an examination of classic and contemporary Christian and Buddhist texts in dialogue with recent theoretical options for the comparative study of religious ethics.  We will begin with an assessment of the importance and distinctive quality of religious voices in moral debate and then look at some of the ways that contemporary scholars have approached the investigation and assessment of similarities and differences in moral world views.  The middle portion of the course will focus on a careful reading of selected Christian and Buddhist texts that offer visions of the moral life.  The course will conclude with a comparative consideration of Buddhist and Christian positions on the moral issue of abortion and the relationship of human beings to the natural world.  Course requirements include two short critical response papers and a longer final paper.

Using these and many authors we will ask questions about what constitutes the moral imagination, how such an imagination is manifested in or apparent in the social, personal and religious lives of the various African peoples or characters portrayed in these literary works; to what extent the moral sense has helped/ conditioned or failed to influence the lives of these peoples and characters. We will also inquire into the extent and in what ways the writers in our selection have helped to shape the moral imagination of their people.

As the youngest of the three Abrahamic religions, Islam has a lot of things to say about Abraham which largely correspond to the Biblical story although the Qur'an also contains some novel features, including the claim that Abraham, together with Ishmael, built the Ka‘bah. This course will discuss how the scriptures of the three religions emerged within the same cultural milieu, and explore their intertwined histories and the ways in which Jews, Christians, and Muslims developed their own independent religious identities from their early encounters to the present. Students will also be introduced to some basic teachings of Islam. No prior knowledge of Islam is required.
THEO 60806	This course studies the basic elements of ecclesiology: what is a lay person, what is a priest, what is a Bishop, and what is a pope for?  We read fundamental texts in ecclesiology such as the Book of Acts.  We discuss ecumenism and synodality.  Modern novelists such as Willa Cather and George Bernanos will help us to consider the question of what makes the Church catholic and apostolic. 
THEO 60823	An exploration of how the voices of women have helped to reshape theological discourse and to bring to light new dimensions of the Christian tradition. The course will focus on the significance of gender and social location in understanding the theological vocation and task, theological anthropology, Christology/soteriology, the mystery of God, and women's spirituality. Readings will include selections from theologians who identify their work as feminist, womanist, Latina, mujerista, African, Asian, or from the global South or &quot;Third World.&quot;
THEO 60824	The class will review various New Testament portrayals of Jesus and compare the methodology of Biblical studies and of systematic theology.  This will lead us to the complex comparison of the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith.   We will review the core Christological definitions of Nicaea, Constantinople, Chalcedon and Nicaea IV. We will learn about the controversies about portraying Christ and the saints in the Eastern Church, leading down to Nicaea II.  We will relate this to iconoclasm in the period of the Protestant and Catholic Reformations, and we will study Trent on Icons and Images.  We will study modern Orthodox Iconophile' theologies such as that of Paul Evdomikov. We will study the changing depictions of Christ in Art from the 2nd century to modern times with a special focus on Christ in contemporary art. We will consider three Jesus movies' specifically with reference to the aesthetics of the depiction of Christ. Running parallel each of these movies, we will read Love Alone is Credible by Hans Urs von Balthasar.
THEO 60828	This course aims to explore the canons in the Code of Canon Law which govern a sacramental marriage in the Roman Catholic Church.  We will look at them from a legal and pastoral perspective.  The goal of this course is to assist those individuals who will be working in the Church, be it through Sacred Orders or lay ministry, to understand and interact with the Code. This course will also take a cursory look at the canons that govern the other sacraments of the Church and the applicable Rites.  Additionally, in interacting with the Code of Canon Law, this course will study the appropriate teachings found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, as well as parts of the post-synodal apostolic exhortation of Pope Francis, Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love).
THEO 60838	This course looks at a theology of Christian ministry, both ordained and lay. The relevant official documents will be read, as well as secondary sources that articulate the sacrament of ordination, hierarchy, the lay apostolate and baptismal priesthood of all Christians, and current definitions of Lay Ecclesial Ministry. Both seminarians and lay divinity students should develop the concepts necessary to understand their particular ministry in the light of Church teaching and as a service to the people of God.
THEO 60849	This course is offered as a systematic and historical introduction to Christian Spirituality with a systematic focus on its nature, stages, and goal; an historical focus on different traditions and representative figures; a thematic focus on the kinds of language and literary figures that are used to describe the spiritual life (e.g., in terms of a journey, maturation, mountain-climbing, and kinds of relationship, etc.), and a practical focus on the disciplines that cultivate it and are conducive to its end.  Other than Scripture, various saints and spiritual authors to be read include Catherine of Siena, Guigo II, Basil Moreau (the founder of the Congregation of the Holy Cross), Origen, Ignatius of Antioch, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine, Benedict, Bernard of Clairvaux, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, Thérèse of Lisieux, Symeon the New Theologian, Gregory Palamas, Seraphim of Sarov, Caryll Houselander, and Scott Hahn.
THEO 60947	This course examines the theology and practice of infant baptism, weddings, funerals and anointing of the sick, with emphasis on ministerial roles
THEO 60950	Preaching III builds on the knowledge and skills acquired in Preaching I and II. This course places special emphasis upon the theological dimensions of Christian preaching, challenging each student to integrate and define his/her theology of preaching. Three particular theological themes will be taken up: 1. Preaching special occasions, especially funerals, weddings, the rites of Christian Initiation, Masses or other liturgies with children, and weekday Masses and/or prayer services 2. Preaching as “naming God’s grace,” and helping the People of God to do so as well 3. Preaching as proclamation of a prophetic word, with special attention to biblical justice and Catholic Social Teaching Assigned readings and/or videos will be discussed in class, which will be in seminar style. As with the earlier courses in the preaching cycle, the main work of the course is preparation, delivery, and review of homilies or other preaching events.
THEO 60951	Reconciliation Ministry is designed to: (1) introduce ministry students to the history and theology of the sacrament of reconciliation; (2) provide an initial &quot;confessional experience&quot; (practicum) from which students can benefit from guidance, supervision, and constructive criticism; (3) assist students in understanding the importance of penance/reconciliation in the life and ministry of the church. (Fall)
THEO 60957	Pastoral Administration 2 is reserved for 3rd year lay ministry students and 3rd and 4th year brothers and seminarians who have already taken both Pastoral Admin  and Leadership, Authority, and Power. This course will review, deepen, and elaborate upon essential pastoral and administrative skills and dispositions for those about to enter full time ministry.
THEO 60971	This two-credit course will focus on the theology teacher's role as a minister in the Catholic school. The following questions will be addressed: How does the theology teacher's formation benefit the students? How do assessment, classroom management, discipline, technology, etc. affect the faith formation of the students?
THEO 60976	For the past century, Catholic liturgists and social activists have lived and worked in separate spheres of ministerial and apostolic life. This course will show the implausibility of and problems associated with this dichotomy, and it will point the way toward a more integrated liturgical-social vision. This approach has been set forth in theory by theologians such as Henri de Lubac, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Nicholas Lash, William Cavanaugh, and others, and in practice by such figures as Dorothy Day, Oscar Romero, Daniel Berrigan, and others.
THEO 60985	This course will introduce students to the life and witness of the Salvadoran martyrs, including Archbishop Oscar Romero, the four churchwomen martyred in December of 1980, and the Jesuit community killed in 1989. The course will offer an introduction to the history of El Salvador and explore, in particular, the writings of Romero, his understanding of the Gospel, and his vision of the Church as an agent for peace and justice.
THEO 63001	The Synthesis Seminar, incorporating both oral and written components, affords Master of Divinity students opportunities to synthesize what they have learned over the course of their academic studies and their various formation experiences. The seminar requires students to engage at least two major areas of theological study (Sacred Scripture, History of Christianity, Systematics, Moral Theology/Christian Ethics, World Church/World Religions, and Liturgical Theology) and to integrate them into a pastoral project, broadly understood.  Students develop their project with the help of a faculty advisor. Students present their work to an open audience and facilitate conversation within a seminar format. Finally, students submit a substantive paper (18-22 pages) reflecting the fruit of their research and synthesis.
THEO 63206	Students in the Proseminar will consider the impact of critical theory in Early Christian Studies.   Together, we will examine some of the most prominent theoretical models and discuss their usefulness. We will read selections from classic works by Bourdieu, Douglas, Foucault, Butler, Barthes, Derrida, Genette, de Certeau, and Bhabha, among others.  At the same time, we will discuss a selection of recent essays and articles that draw on these theoretical models and insights to illuminate aspects of early Christianity. Requirements for the course include a short, oral report, a midterm examination, and the preparation of a conference-length paper, as well as regular participation in our shared discussions.
THEO 63209	This 1-credit seminar course will center on the theological writings of John Paul II concerning the mystery of man and woman and the sacramental meaning of the body as &quot;sign.&quot; Centering on selections from his catechetical homilies known as &quot;the theology of the body,&quot; the course will follow these themes through the JPII's &quot;Letter to Women&quot; and Mulieris Dignitatem.  
THEO 65932	During the spring semester of the first year of Field Education, in addition to continued case study work, students explore in greater depth pastoral topics attending to the skills and dispositions necessary to work with specific constituencies or in specific areas/types of ministry. Over the course of their first year, in the field education seminars and in ministry placements allowing for significant one-on-one service (often termed &quot;ministry of presence&quot;), students appraise the ministerial skills they already possess, deepen their understanding of the goals of professional education for ministry, and develop a common theological and ministerial language.
THEO 65935	A thematic presentation of various pastoral topics encountered in ministry.
THEO 66004	Research and writing on an approved subject under the direction of a faculty member

THEO 67014	This course is inended for students in the Echo Program who are doing field work in their placement diocese during the academic year.
THEO 67601	This course seeks to develop the lay ecclesial minister's human qualities and character, fostering a healthy and well-balanced personality, for the sake of both personal growth and ministerial service. Additionally, we will focus on spiritual formation as it aims to arouse and animate true hunger for holiness, desire for union with the Father through Christ in the Spirit, daily growing in love of God and neighbor in life and ministry, and the practices of prayer and spirituality that foster these attitudes and dispositions. Openness to the fundamental conversion that places God, and not oneself, at the center of one's life, is a prerequisite for fruitful formation.
THEO 67802	Required for non-degree-seeking seminarians only. (Every semester)
THEO 68800	This research course is for MA students preparing for their capstone projects while enrolled in another Spring semester course.
THEO 68801	This course must be taken in the semester before the MA Capstone. In this semester students will read and research in preparation for writing a capstone paper and its oral presentation.
THEO 68802	This course is open for enrollment only for those taking their comprehensive exams in July (July 20-24, 2015). However, students beginning preparations for the Exams (in 2016) are also encouraged and welcome to attend (but not to enroll in) the evening sessions. Some of these sessions will help students beginning preparations (those a year out from the Exam); others will assist students completing their preparations (those taking the exam this summer). Please, email the instructor for further details.
THEO 78600	Required of nonresident master's degree students who are completing their theses in absentia and who wish to retain their degree status.
THEO 80101	This course reviews and reinforces the basics of Syriac grammar and guides students through texts from the third through the thirteenth centuries. These texts are organized around questions of genre and theme and with the aim of helping students navigate the variety of styles, scripts, and print media encountered in the study of Syriac theology. 
THEO 81215	Arabic Readings in the Qur'an is for students who have completed at least three semesters (or the equivalent) of Arabic. At our weekly meetings we will read together passages from the Arabic Qur'an and discuss their meaning and possible translations into English. Regular attendance is required. We will meet in 227 Malloy Hall.
THEO 83013	This fourth-semester course in biblical Hebrew will continue and build upon THEO 60006/83001. While the latter was devoted to the reading of biblical prose, this installment of Intermediate Hebrew will introduce students to the beauty of biblical Hebrew poetry. Our efforts will be focused on the preparation, oral reading, and translation of selected biblical passages. But time also will be spent continuing to review basic grammar as well as developing an appreciation of syntax and poetic structure (e.g., parallelism) in this powerful medium of prayer, prophetic revelation, and the quest for Wisdom in ancient Israel. 
THEO 83133	This course will offer students an introduction to Ugaritic language and culture as well as an overview of the discipline of Ugaritology. An important ancillary goal of the class will be to assist those enrolled in appreciating the significance of ancient Ugarit within the historical and cultural landscape of the ancient Near East, as well as the importance of its literary and cultural artifacts for biblical scholars, theologians, and others with an interest in the evolution of ancient Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
THEO 83148	This seminar is on the study of “the historical Jesus” with a special focus on current methodological debates.
THEO 83149	This course will follow the historical development of the Septuagint and other Greek translations of the Hebrew Bible, from their earliest roots in Second Temple period Judaism to their early reception as Christian scripture in the first four centuries CE. A significant focus of the course will be reading these Greek translations alongside the ancient Hebrew versions in the original languages.
THEO 83214	This seminar aims to introduce students to various discourses that have influenced modern theology. We will cover topics such as how to interpret texts, assess them, and understand the context and assumptions within them. The seminar title may seem confusing since it connects an Augustinian friar and a Cologne philosopher. However, they both recognize the importance of the emotional, intuitive, and a-logical aspects of humanity and reflect on inner life. We will discuss devotio moderna and its influences, Erasmus, the Augustinian reform movement under Staupitz, and Luther himself. The second area we will explore is the theology developed after the Reformation. We will discuss approaches to Scripture and Revelation, changes in the understanding of faith, and how theologians analyze and prepare for faith. The third area of inquiry will focus on the question of certitude in matters of faith. We will examine how theologians negotiate ambiguity and manage certitude. We will also discuss the theological notes and how they assign levels of authority to church teachings. Fourth, we will explore the developments that led to the creation of the Enlightenment and what it was. We will cover Enlightenment thought and how it influenced the recovery of intuition in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, and Scheler. Lastly, we will examine how to deal with accounts of miracles or the impossible such as bilocations or levitations. While I have not yet determined the entire syllabus, I am considering using selections from various books, eg.: 
THEO 83216	Grace is central to the accounts offered by Aquinas and Calvin of divine-human relations. Their respective theologies of grace are each rich and nuanced, bringing together and giving expression in distinctive ways to what each of these great theologians believes about God, about humans, and about Christ, as pertinent to the depiction of humans before God. To answer the questions, ‘what is grace’ and ‘what does grace do’ is to say who God is and how God acts in the world of humans; to say what humans are and how they stand in need; to formulate the basic condition of the moral life of the Christian; and, to proclaim the decisive action of God through Christ for human salvation. This doctoral seminar on grace will thus take students to the heart of the theologies of Aquinas, and, of Calvin. The seminar will revolve around study of the main texts of Calvin and of Aquinas on grace itself, supplemented by texts on select adjacent topics, such as: Law, in its various manifestations (e.g., eternal; natural; revealed, both Old and New); sin; predestination (of Christ himself, and of others ‘in Christ’); and, pneumatology, inasmuch as grace is the grace of, precisely, the Holy Spirit, and participation in Christ comes through the Holy Spirit).
THEO 83265	The course explores Augustine as a theologian, with particular attention given to Augustine's De Trinitate.
THEO 83301	This course designed to offer advanced graduate students an introduction to theological pedagogy.
THEO 83403	All rites that were celebrated in Latin between Late Antiquity and the Reformation. We will begin by tracing the processes by which readings, prayers, hymns, calendars, and liturgical regulations were assembled into collections, with attention to parallel Eastern developments. Then we'll follow how these collections were organized into plenary liturgical books for the urban rites of Rome, Milan, Ravenna, Aquilea-Grado, Benevento, the so-called Mozarabic, Gallican, Celtic, and North African rites, and the rites of the religious orders. Extensive work with specialized print and online reference tools. Some attention to medieval vernaculars. Each student will have their own medieval manuscript to research.
THEO 83426	The conversion of Slavic peoples to Christianity marked a decisive moment in the Christianization of Europe and the inculturation of Christianity beyond the romanitas of the Latin and Byzantine worlds. Today, Slavs make up the largest percentage of Christians in the Orthodox Church, and recent studies reveal Slavic countries to range from among the least religious (e.g. Czech Republic) to the most religious (e.g. Poland) Roman Catholic countries in Europe. This doctoral seminar will engage and encourage new research on Slavic religious practice from the Middle Ages to today. Significant investigation will be conducted on the earliest Glagolitic heritage, which offers new insights into unique medieval Slavic liturgical practices at the crossroads of eastern and western traditions. Other topics include the relationship between liturgy and national identity in the past and present; the complex and varied medieval attitudes toward inculturation and the vernacular; liturgical praxis during periods of oppression and/or persecution (i.e. Ottoman period, communist regimes, etc.); and examples of liturgical renewal movements, theological renaissances and religious debates within various Slavic societies today.
THEO 83649	Since the publication of John Rawls' &lt;i&gt;Theory of Justice&lt;/i&gt; almost half a century ago, philosophical work on justice has enjoyed something of a renaissance among Anglophone philosophers. Theologians have drawn on and contributed to ongoing debates over justice, but much of this material remains relatively unknown in theological circles. In this seminar, we will read through key contributions to contemporary debates over justice, focusing especially on philosophical works while considering them from our distinctive standpoint as theological ethicists. Authors to be read will include Rawls, Walzer, Raz, Sen, and Shklar. Course requirements will include one or two seminar presentations and a final paper.
THEO 83706	This class will introduce students to the major modern theories of myth and ritual, with particular emphasis given to the questions these theories raise for Catholic theology and the ways that Catholic theologians might adopt them for their own purposes. Readings will include E. B. Tylor, James Frazer, Emile Durkheim, Claude Levi-Strauss, E. E. Evans Pritchard, Catherine Bell, Victor Turner, Clifford Geertz, René Girard, Walter Burkert, and Roy Rappaport (among the anthropologists of religion) and Maurice de la Taille, Wilhelm Schmidt, Louis Bouyer, Jean-Daniélou, and Karl Rahner (among the theologians). 
THEO 83809	This seminar will focus on contemporary systematic approaches and questions in the area of Christian theological anthropology. After consideration of the twentieth-century nature/grace disputes in the Catholic tradition, the seminar will explore the contributions of selected Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox theologians to a theological understanding of the mystery of being human. Particular attention will be given to contemporary efforts to address the question of what constitutes human personhood and/or to retrieve one or more of the classic anthropological symbols of creation in the image of God, original sin, redemption/divinization, and resurrection of the body. Seminar discussion will include consideration of how authors assess the major challenges that theological anthropology needs to address today and the sources and starting points for their projects as well as their constructive proposals.
THEO 83812	This course focuses on the eschata as these have been problematized and interpreted in modern and contemporary theology. Coming in for consideration will not only be various interpretations of the &quot;kingdom of God,&quot; both vertical and horizontal, individual and social, but also the relation of eschatology to Christology, on the one hand, and anthropology, on the other. Theological interpretations of the symbol of &quot;resurrection&quot; will come in for special attention, given that it provides the connective tissue between the three different areas. This symbol also seems to bring to the fore not simply issues of theological justification but also imagination. Whether we can imagine or how to imagine &quot;resurrection&quot; will be an issue for the course. Authors that will be discussed include Hans Kung, Karl Rahner, Benedict XVI, Paul Fiddes, and Gustavo Gutierrez. At least a third of the course will be devoted to contemporary apocalyptic figuration of eschatology. Obvious ssues here include the question of the definition of apocalyptic and whether biblical apocalyptic is appealed to and if so which biblical texts are prioritized. Authors to be read include Johann Baptist Metz, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Sergei Bulgakov, and Catherine Keller.
THEO 83816	This course is a systematic and critical exploration of the origins, content and trends in contemporary African Christian theologies. We will study in some detail the work of some of the more prominent African theologians who are  working or who have worked in  biblical studies, moral theology, liturgy, systematic theology, Christology and ecclesiology. Our aim would be to see how these various scholars have articulated  and furthered the efforts of the African faith communities to  come to terms with both their traditional African religious heritages and their Christian faith.   Some of the themes to be explored include (but are by no means restricted to) the emergent christologies which constitute the cornerstone of African theologies and the contribution these christologies  as well as  the challenges they pose to world Christianity; the meaning scope and biblical foundations of inculturation in contemporary African theologies; the dialogue between Christianity and African religion;  the challenge of the NRMs to Christian theology and praxis in the  main line churches; the moral methodology and concerns of African Christian theology; the intersection of liturgy and spirituality in African theology and ecclesial patterns, etc.
THEO 83835	This course focuses on the way in which memory and desire are utilized and problematized in modern and contemporary theology.  The terms memory and desire have Christological and anthropological valences; the course will treat both.  Further, because contemporary thinkers draw on and manipulate classical models of memory and desire, the first part of the course will reconstruct models presented in Scripture, classical philosophy, Augustine, and Bonaventure.  The course will then turn to retrievals of these early models, discussing Heidegger, Rahner, Metz, Ratzinger, Marion, and Ricoeur.  Because memory is correlated to desire, the course will investigate the way in which these thinkers present theological anthropologies of desire alongside memory.  Careful attention will be paid not only to the individual person as remembering and desiring, but also the way in which the body of Christ (and therein ecclesiology) refines and challenges models of memory and desire. Beyond ST, students from other concentrations will be welcome to develop research projects relating the course to their particular interests.

WR 13100	Writing and Rhetoric introduces students to the study and composition of ethical arguments. Engaging with a variety of rhetorical situations and genres, students will make claims supported by evidence, consider counterarguments, and conduct research. Special attention is devoted to the collaborative, social, and iterative aspects of the writing process, as students exchange feedback with their peers and subsequently revise their work. Students will also reflect on their development as writers and critical thinkers.
WR 13200	These sections of Writing and Rhetoric place students in learning situations that engage with the local community, often in off-campus activities. Each section focuses on a particular social issue and its attendant discourse, with related writing assignments and community work. Students learn to craft effective arguments and pursue academic research. Some sections also carry the SUS4 designation, counting the course toward the Minor in Sustainability. We welcome all students with an interest in community engagement and a commitment to social justice.
WR 13300	Multimedia Writing and Rhetoric focuses on ethical, rhetorical, and practical dimensions of composing across modalities. Students explore ways image, sound, language, and design help writers achieve rhetorical goals in specific contexts and with specific audiences. Students read, analyze, research, and create a variety of multimodal texts including such genres as podcasts, videos, presentations, posters, fine art, and print-based essays. Prior technological skills are not necessary, but students should be open to experimenting with tools for multimodal composing and revising.
