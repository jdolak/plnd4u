    <h3 id="project-description">Project Description</h3>

    <p>PLND4U is a four-year planner that allows students to search courses
    that have been taught in past semesters at Notre Dame, and assign them
    to openings in their personal eight-semester plan. PLND4U will consider
    the major requirements of its user, as well as the
    prerequisites/corequisites of the selected courses, and inform the user
    if their four-year plan is valid.</p>

    <h3 id="usefulness">Usefulness</h3>

    <p>PLND4U will allow student to create a roadmap of their upcoming years
    at Notre Dame. This will allow for more academic confidence and help
    students navigate into potential concentrations and fields they enjoy.
    Currently, PATH class search allows you to create plans for Notre Dame
    classes for a single semester. Additionally, there are third party site
    that you can use to make 4 year plans. However, there does not exist a
    platform which both are combined together to create a catered
    experience.</p>

    <h3 id="realness">Realness</h3>

    <p>Data will include information on courses offered and user inputed
    data. Information on course include class title, class code, CRN,
    Professors, and prerequisites. We would like to obtain an existing
    database for courses offered in the past. However, if we do not have
    access to this we can scrape class data from the PATH class search html
    file.</p>
