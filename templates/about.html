                <p class="normal-text">PLND4U is a four-year planner that allows students to search courses
                that have been taught in past semesters at Notre Dame, and assign them
                to openings in their personal eight-semester plan. PLND4U will consider
                the major requirements of its user, as well as the
                prerequisites/corequisites of the selected courses, and inform the user
                if their four-year plan is valid.</p>

                <p class="normal-text">PLND4U will allow student to create a roadmap of their upcoming years
                at Notre Dame. This will allow for more academic confidence and help
                students navigate into potential concentrations and fields they enjoy.
                Currently, PATH class search allows you to create plans for Notre Dame
                classes for a single semester. Additionally, there are third party site
                that you can use to make 4 year plans. However, there does not exist a
                platform which both are combined together to create a catered
                experience.</p>

                data. Information on course include class title, class code, CRN,
                Professors, and prerequisites. We would like to obtain an existing
                database for courses offered in the past. However, if we do not have
                access to this we can scrape class data from the PATH class search html
